### [1] [Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801)
*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a standalone autoregressive model for high-quality image generation, outperforming diffusion models like DALL-E 3 and SANA, with multi-task capabilities and efficient decoding strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revitalize autoregressive models for image generation without relying on pretrained components or hybrid architectures, ensuring architectural freedom and licensing flexibility.

Method: Trained from scratch with a unified tokenization scheme, enabling diverse tasks like image editing and controllable synthesis. Efficient decoding strategies (e.g., inference-time scaling) improve quality and speed.

Result: Matches or surpasses diffusion models on benchmarks (GenEval, DPG) and excels in multi-task performance (Graph200K).

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a versatile foundation model for unified multimodal generation, with released code and models.

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [2] [SV3.3B: A Sports Video Understanding Model for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17844)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B is a lightweight 3.3B parameter model for automated sports video analysis, excelling in fine-grained athletic movement understanding and on-device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sports video analysis models are computationally intensive, lack fine-grained understanding, and miss critical movement phases.

Method: Combines temporal motion difference sampling, self-supervised learning, DWT-VGG16-LDA keyframe extraction, V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder, and LLM decoder.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o variants with 29.2% improvement in ground truth validation metrics, excelling in information density and action complexity.

Conclusion: SV3.3B offers a computationally efficient, high-performance solution for detailed sports video analysis.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++ is a training-free framework using Progressive Detail Injection (PDI) to improve text-to-image generation for complex prompts by decomposing them into simpler sub-prompts and refining stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple subjects and attributes, prompting the need for a method mimicking human drawing processes.

Method: Decomposes prompts into sub-prompts, uses staged generation with self-attention for layout control, and employs cross-attention and Centroid Alignment Loss for attribute binding.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on benchmarks, especially for multi-object and complex stylistic scenarios.

Conclusion: Detail++ effectively addresses complex prompt challenges in text-to-image generation through progressive refinement and improved attribute binding.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

### [4] [FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859)
*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M is a unified benchmark for fish detection in underwater imagery, addressing fragmented datasets and inconsistent evaluations. It includes 13 datasets, evaluates 28 models, and introduces a CLIP-based selection framework for adaptive deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate fish detection is crucial for ecological monitoring and aquaculture, but practical deployment is hindered by fragmented datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols.

Method: FishDet-M harmonizes 13 datasets with COCO-style annotations and benchmarks 28 object detection models, including YOLO, R-CNN, and DETR variants. It introduces a CLIP-based model selection framework for adaptive deployment.

Result: Results show varying performance across models, highlighting accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. The CLIP-based selection framework achieves high performance without ensemble computation.

Conclusion: FishDet-M provides a standardized platform for underwater object detection, with all resources publicly available to advance research in marine computer vision.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses Generative AI (LightningDiT) to assess fairness in melanoma classifiers, highlighting challenges when training and evaluation datasets differ, but suggests synthetic data can improve fairness in medical-imaging AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in AI-based melanoma screening by ensuring fairness across diverse groups (sex, age, race) using synthetic data.

Method: Leveraged the LightningDiT model to generate realistic synthetic data for fairness evaluation of melanoma classifiers.

Result: Fairness assessment is promising with synthetic data but challenging when training and evaluation datasets differ.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers a new way to evaluate and improve fairness in medical-imaging AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restormer uses channel-wise self-attention for image restoration but may miss local artifacts. DiNAT-IR introduces Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) with a channel-aware module to balance global and local context, improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of self-attention in high-resolution image restoration, particularly the trade-off between efficiency and quality, and the oversight of localized artifacts.

Method: Proposes DiNAT-IR, integrating Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) with mixed dilation factors and a channel-aware module to enhance global context understanding while preserving local precision.

Result: DiNAT-IR achieves competitive results across multiple benchmarks, offering high-quality solutions for low-level vision tasks.

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR effectively balances global and local context for image restoration, outperforming existing methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module to improve UDA-SS by balancing local and global features, enhancing segmentation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods struggle with balancing fine-grained details and global context, leading to segmentation errors.

Method: AFR refines high-resolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits, integrates high-frequency components, and uses uncertainty-driven attention.

Result: AFR improves UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V→Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia→Cityscapes.

Conclusion: AFR's lightweight design and effectiveness make it a state-of-the-art solution for UDA-SS.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPEN, a dataset for AI-driven engagement recognition in older adults during virtual group learning, addressing gaps in research and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engagement in virtual learning is crucial but hard to measure, especially for older adults. Existing research lacks focus on this demographic and longitudinal engagement tracking.

Method: The OPEN dataset includes facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, plus affective/behavioral features from 35+ hours of virtual cardiac rehab sessions. Annotations cover engagement states, context, and more.

Result: Machine/deep learning models trained on OPEN achieved up to 81% accuracy in engagement recognition.

Conclusion: OPEN enables scalable, personalized engagement modeling for older adults and advances broader engagement recognition research.

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

### [9] [Bearded Dragon Activity Recognition Pipeline: An AI-Based Approach to Behavioural Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17987)
*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated system using YOLO models for real-time video analysis of bearded dragon behaviors (basking and hunting) was developed, with YOLOv8s performing best. Basking detection was reliable, but hunting detection was less accurate due to weak cricket detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon behavior is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Five YOLO variants were trained on a custom dataset (1200 images). YOLOv8s was selected for its accuracy-speed balance. The system processes video with object detection, temporal interpolation, and rule-based behavior classification.

Result: YOLOv8s achieved high accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855). Basking detection was reliable, but hunting detection suffered due to poor cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).

Conclusion: The system improves reptile behavior monitoring efficiency. Future work will enhance cricket detection for better hunting behavior accuracy.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

*Huy Nguyen,Kien Nguyen,Akila Pemasiri,Akmal Jahan,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset, and proposes TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture to address cross-platform and cross-modality challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on ground-level perspectives, which suffer from occlusions and limited coverage. Aerial perspectives can solve these issues, but no dataset exists for this scenario.

Method: The authors introduce AG-VPReID.VIR dataset with 1,837 identities across 4,861 tracklets. They propose TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture using style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and intermediary-guided temporal modeling.

Result: AG-VPReID.VIR presents unique challenges, and TCC-VPReID achieves significant performance gains across multiple evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework address limitations of ground-based systems and improve cross-modality person Re-ID, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at
https://github.com/agvpreid25/AG-VPReID.VIR.

### [11] [Exploring the interplay of label bias with subgroup size and separability: A case study in mammographic density classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17996)
*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how label bias in medical imaging datasets impacts deep learning models, focusing on subgroup size and separability, and reveals significant shifts in feature representations and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied issue of label bias in medical imaging datasets and its impact on the fairness of AI systems.

Method: Trained deep learning models for binary tissue density classification using the EMBED dataset, simulating label bias in separable and non-separable subgroups.

Result: Label bias caused shifts in learned features, influenced by subgroup size and separability. Performance varied based on whether validation labels were clean or biased.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical impact of label bias on subgroup fairness in medical AI, emphasizing the need for careful validation.

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

### [12] [Registration beyond Points: General Affine Subspace Alignment via Geodesic Distance on Grassmann Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17998)
*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper derives an optimizable cost function for measuring distances between Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformations, improving registration problems in computer vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack an explicit, optimizable distance function for Grassmannian features, limiting their use in registration tasks.

Method: The authors mathematically prove that high-dimensional subspace bases can represent the cost and propose an optimizable function based on transformed bases.

Result: The derived cost function and its extension to a BnB solver outperform existing solutions in computer vision tasks.

Conclusion: The method provides a globally optimal solution by minimizing geodesic distance, advancing Grassmannian-based registration.

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Motivation: Current multimodal models lag behind LLMs in architectural sophistication, prompting the need for improvements.

Method: Incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into CoCa's textual decoders and ViT encoder.

Result: GRR-CoCa outperformed Baseline CoCa with significant improvements in contrastive loss, perplexity, and CoCa loss during pretraining and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa's architecture enhances performance and generalization in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

*Yuezun Li,Delong Zhu,Xinjie Cui,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Celeb-DF++, a large-scale DeepFake dataset with diverse forgery types to address the challenge of generalizable forensics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack diversity in forgery types, limiting the development of generalizable DeepFake detection methods.

Method: The authors expand the Celeb-DF dataset to create Celeb-DF++, covering three forgery scenarios (Face-swap, Face-reenactment, Talking-face) using 22 DeepFake methods.

Result: The dataset highlights the limitations of current detection methods and their inability to generalize across diverse DeepFake types.

Conclusion: Celeb-DF++ serves as a challenging benchmark for advancing generalizable DeepFake detection.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian inpainting framework improves 3D scene reconstruction by refining masks and optimizing region-wise uncertainty, outperforming existing methods in quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting 3D scenes is challenging due to irregular structures and multi-view consistency needs, motivating a solution for accurate and realistic reconstruction.

Method: The framework uses a Mask Refinement Process and Uncertainty-guided Optimization, refining masks with Gaussian filtering and back-projection, and optimizing regions based on multi-view importance.

Result: Experiments show superior visual quality and view consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses 3D inpainting challenges, enhancing fidelity and consistency in reconstructed scenes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive review of emotion recognition through body movements, leveraging advancements in 3D skeleton technology and pose estimation.

Method: Categorizes techniques into posture-based and gait-based approaches, introducing a taxonomy of four paradigms: Traditional, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet.

Result: Benchmarking results across datasets and exploration of applications in mental health (e.g., depression, autism).

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges and future directions in skeleton-based emotion recognition.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

*Ahmad ALBarqawi,Mahmoud Nazzal,Issa Khalil,Abdallah Khreishah,NhatHai Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViGText integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) text explanations in a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection, outperforming traditional methods in generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of sophisticated deepfakes challenges traditional detection methods, which lack generalization and robustness against attacks.

Method: ViGText divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for analysis, leveraging multi-level feature extraction.

Result: ViGText achieves significant improvements: F1 scores rise from 72.45% to 98.32% in generalization, and recall increases by 11.1%. It also limits performance degradation under attacks to less than 4%.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new standard for deepfake detection by combining detailed visual and textual analysis, enhancing media authenticity and information integrity.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset to improve AI-generated video models' ability to handle multi-scene prompts by learning coherent scene transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with generating longer videos involving multiple scenes due to a lack of scene transition awareness, primarily because they are trained on single-scene datasets.

Method: The authors propose the TAV dataset, which includes preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions, and demonstrate its effectiveness through post-training experiments.

Result: Post-training on TAV improves scene transition understanding, reduces the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: The TAV dataset enhances multi-scene video generation by addressing the limitations of single-scene training data.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

TL;DR: BokehDiff is a new lens blur rendering method using generative diffusion prior for physically accurate and visually appealing results, overcoming depth estimation limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods suffer from artifacts due to inaccurate depth estimation, especially at depth discontinuities.

Method: Uses a physics-inspired self-attention module with depth-dependent constraints and adapts diffusion models for one-step inference without extra noise.

Result: Achieves high-quality, high-fidelity blur rendering.

Conclusion: BokehDiff effectively addresses depth-related artifacts and data scarcity by leveraging diffusion models for realistic foreground synthesis.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-IMI is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) using vision-language models (VLMs) and iterative manual instructions (IMIs) to leverage semantic guidance from normal-light images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLIE methods lack semantic guidance from normal-light images, limiting effectiveness in complex lighting.

Method: VLM-IMI integrates textual descriptions of normal-light content and uses an instruction prior fusion module to align image and text features. It refines instructions iteratively for better results.

Result: VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances low-light images by leveraging semantic cues and iterative refinement.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextSAM-EUS is a lightweight, text-driven adaptation of SAM for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, outperforming SOTA models with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EUS segmentation is challenging due to speckle noise, low contrast, and reliance on expert annotations. TextSAM-EUS aims to automate this without manual prompts.

Method: Uses BiomedCLIP text encoder for prompt learning and LoRA-based adaptation of SAM, tuning only 0.86% of parameters.

Result: Achieves 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD with automatic prompts, surpassing existing models.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS is efficient and robust for EUS segmentation, pioneering prompt learning in SAM-based medical imaging.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively support urban planning and policy-making by providing accurate LULC mapping insights.

Abstract: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping is essential for urban and resource
planning, and is one of the key elements in developing smart and sustainable
cities.This study evaluates advanced LULC mapping techniques, focusing on
Look-Up Table (LUT)-based Atmospheric Correction applied to Cartosat
Multispectral (MX) sensor images, followed by supervised and semi-supervised
learning models for LULC prediction. We explore DeeplabV3+ and Cross-Pseudo
Supervision (CPS). The CPS model is further refined with dynamic weighting,
enhancing pseudo-label reliability during training. This comprehensive approach
analyses the accuracy and utility of LULC mapping techniques for various urban
planning applications. A case study of Hyderabad, India, illustrates
significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat
MX images over time, we highlight shifts such as urban sprawl, shrinking green
spaces, and expanding industrial areas. This demonstrates the practical utility
of these techniques for urban planners and policymakers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) lack temporal awareness and generalization, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: The framework uses supervised fine-tuning with high-quality cold start data, followed by difficulty-controlled reinforcement learning to enhance temporal localization.

Result: The method outperforms existing models on multiple benchmarks, especially in challenging and open-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: High-quality cold start data and difficulty-controlled RL are crucial for improving VTG models, with released resources to aid further research.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

TL;DR: A Transformer model predicts fMRI responses to multimodal movies using visual, auditory, and language inputs, leveraging pretrained models and dual cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop encoding models for predicting whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal stimuli, addressing long-range temporal structure and individual variability.

Method: Sequence-to-sequence Transformer with autoregressive prediction, integrating prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual cross-attention. Uses pretrained models (VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, BridgeTower) for feature extraction.

Result: Achieves strong performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating effective brain activity prediction.

Conclusion: The model successfully captures temporal and multimodal structure in stimuli and neural responses, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

*JinYoung Kim,DaeUng Jo,Kimin Yun,Jeonghyo Song,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a framework for joint modeling of distributional uncertainty and OoD detection using free energy, improving upon conventional methods like MC Dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods like MC Dropout focus on either model or data uncertainty, lacking semantic alignment with OoD detection. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Introduces a free-energy-based density estimator (Beta distribution) and integrates it into a posterior network for direct uncertainty estimation without stochastic sampling. Combines with RPL framework for learning OoD regions.

Result: Validated on benchmarks (Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, Segment-Me-If-You-Can), showing effectiveness in uncertainty-aware segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a semantically meaningful and efficient solution for OoD detection and uncertainty estimation in deep neural networks.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF) with two modules to improve Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) by addressing sample heterogeneity and optimization imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFER methods degrade under sample heterogeneity from multi-source data and individual variability.

Method: HDF includes Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) for robust time-frequency modeling and Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) to balance losses adaptively.

Result: HDF outperforms on DFEW and FERV39k datasets, achieving higher WAR and UAR with strong generalization.

Conclusion: HDF enhances DFER accuracy and robustness, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

TL;DR: T2VWorldBench is introduced as the first framework to evaluate text-to-video models' ability to generate semantically and factually accurate videos using world knowledge, revealing significant gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models lack evaluation on leveraging world knowledge for semantic consistency and factual accuracy, prompting the need for a systematic benchmark.

Method: T2VWorldBench evaluates models across 6 categories and 1,200 prompts, combining human and automated (VLM-based) evaluations.

Result: Most advanced models fail to generate correct videos due to poor world knowledge understanding, highlighting a critical capability gap.

Conclusion: The findings identify a key research opportunity to enhance text-to-video models with robust commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Result: Significant differences in tortuosity were found between patient groups (AUC 0.8768, sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.93).

Conclusion: The framework is effective for medical curve analysis and has potential for broader diagnostic applications.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

*Jinhong He,Minglong Xue,Zhipu Liu,Mingliang Zhou,Aoxiang Ning,Palaiahnakote Shivakumara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism for low-light image enhancement, addressing structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments in unidirectional methods. It includes adaptive feature interaction and reflection-aware correction for improved results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unidirectional diffusion models struggle with real-world degradation complexity, leading to structural and alignment issues in low-light image enhancement.

Method: A bidirectional diffusion mechanism models degradation in both low-light and normal-light images, with adaptive feature interaction and reflection-aware correction modules.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, generalizing well across diverse degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed bidirectional approach enhances image quality by better capturing degradation patterns and aligning results with human visual perception.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

TL;DR: WaveMamba is a cross-modality fusion method for RGB and IR imagery, using DWT and IDWT for feature decomposition and reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art object detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object detection by leveraging complementary features of RGB and IR imagery through frequency-based fusion.

Method: Uses DWT for feature decomposition, WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB) for cross-band fusion, and IDWT for reconstruction. Includes Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB) and high-frequency enhancement.

Result: Achieves 4.5% average mAP improvement on four benchmarks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: WaveMamba effectively integrates RGB and IR features, demonstrating superior performance in object detection.

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

*Abhishek Kaushik,Norbert Haala,Uwe Soergel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage UDA framework improves 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation by combining contrastive pre-training and ensemble pseudo-labeling, outperforming direct transfer and single-model UDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in 3D LiDAR segmentation due to domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, location) is a critical issue, but manual annotation of target data is impractical.

Method: 1. Unsupervised contrastive learning at segment level pre-trains a backbone network for domain-invariant features. 2. Multi-model pseudo-labeling via ensemble (projection, voxel, hybrid, cylinder-based) refines labels for target domain.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements when adapting from SemanticKITTI to SemanticPOSS/SemanticSlamantic, surpassing direct transfer and single-model UDA.

Conclusion: Combining contrastive pre-training with ensemble pseudo-labeling effectively bridges domain gaps without target annotations.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba combines UNet with mamba mechanism for medical image segmentation, using a Noise Reduction Module to improve accuracy in low-data settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models overfit to noise in data-scarce scenarios, limiting generalization.

Method: Introduces Diff-UMamba with a Noise Reduction Module (NRM) to suppress noise and enhance task-relevant features.

Result: Achieves 1-5% performance gains across datasets, including MSD, AIIB23, BraTS-21, and NSCLC.

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba improves segmentation accuracy and robustness, especially in low-data conditions.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Phan Nguyen Duc Hieu,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL is a self-supervised learning architecture for micrograph analysis, outperforming supervised methods and other SSL approaches with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods for micrograph analysis require retraining for new datasets and perform poorly with few labels. SSL methods often need large datasets, which MatSSL aims to address.

Method: MatSSL uses Gated Feature Fusion for multi-level representation integration, pretrains on small unlabeled data, and fine-tunes on benchmarks.

Result: Achieves 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM (vs. 66.73% ImageNet) and up to 40% improvement on EBC dataset.

Conclusion: MatSSL effectively adapts to metallographic domains with minimal unlabeled data while retaining transferable features from large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Xiaohao Chen,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeEFusion is a distillation method that simplifies text-to-image synthesis by fusing text embeddings, reducing inference costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs of classifier-free guidance (CFG) and complex sampling strategies hinder efficiency in text-to-image synthesis.

Method: TeEFusion distills the teacher model's sampling strategy into a student model by linearly fusing conditional and unconditional text embeddings.

Result: The student model achieves 6x faster inference speeds with comparable image quality to the teacher model.

Conclusion: TeEFusion offers an efficient alternative to CFG, balancing speed and quality in text-to-image synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

*Qilin Huang,Tianyu Lin,Zhiguang Chen,Fudan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF improves medical image segmentation by adapting latent diffusion models, replacing noise prediction with direct segmentation map prediction and using feature distillation for better feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models lack task-specific adjustments for segmentation and have feature extraction deficiencies.

Method: LEAF fine-tunes latent diffusion models by predicting segmentation maps directly and aligns features using distillation.

Result: Enhanced performance across multiple datasets without altering model architecture or increasing inference costs.

Conclusion: LEAF efficiently improves segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

TL;DR: GSDTTA introduces a graph spectral domain approach for efficient 3D point cloud test-time adaptation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of current 3D TTA methods due to irregular point cloud structures and high computational costs.

Method: Uses Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) to adapt point clouds in the spectral domain, optimizing only key frequency components and refining with eigenmap-guided self-training.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA methods in 3D point cloud classification, as shown by benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: GSDTTA offers a more efficient and effective solution for adapting pre-trained models to 3D point cloud data at test time.

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DATA network for feature-level fusion in collaborative perception, addressing domain gaps and temporal misalignment to enhance feature quality and semantic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature-level fusion in collaborative perception is hindered by domain gaps from hardware diversity and temporal misalignment from delays, degrading feature quality.

Method: Proposes the DATA network with CDAM for domain alignment, PTAM for temporal alignment, and IFAM for semantic feature aggregation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, showing robustness to delays and pose errors.

Conclusion: DATA effectively aligns features and enhances semantic representations, improving collaborative perception performance.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

TL;DR: DepthDark is a foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation, addressing dataset and fine-tuning challenges with simulation modules and a PEFT strategy, achieving top performance on night datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current depth estimation models perform poorly in low-light due to lack of datasets and efficient fine-tuning methods.

Method: Uses flare/noise-simulation modules for dataset creation and a PEFT strategy with illumination guidance and multiscale fusion.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets with limited resources.

Conclusion: DepthDark effectively addresses low-light depth estimation challenges, offering robust performance.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view scene reconstruction struggle with real-time processing of long image sequences.

Method: LONG3R employs a memory gating mechanism, a 3D spatio-temporal memory, and a two-stage curriculum training strategy.

Result: LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-sequence reconstruction while maintaining real-time speed.

Conclusion: LONG3R advances real-time 3D scene reconstruction for long sequences, addressing prior limitations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning and a two-stage diffusion model to improve infrared small target detection (ISTD) under data scarcity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISTD methods rely on costly manual-labeling data and perform poorly in real-world scarcity scenarios, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Group Squeezer for non-uniform quantization and two-stage diffusion models for real-world reconstruction to enhance ISTD resilience.

Result: The approach significantly improves detection performance in scarcity scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses ISTD challenges under data scarcity, offering higher quality and fidelity in synthetic samples.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study uses Mendelian randomization to find a causal link between dental caries and lung cancer, mediated by lung function decline, but no link for periodontitis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore causal relationships between dental traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and assess mediation by pulmonary function.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic instruments from large genome-wide association studies; inverse variance weighting for analysis; delta method for mediation assessment.

Result: Dental caries significantly increases lung cancer risk (especially squamous cell carcinoma), partially mediated by lung function decline (FVC and FEV1). No effect found for periodontitis.

Conclusion: Dental caries causally increases lung cancer risk, suggesting dental care and lung function monitoring should be part of cancer prevention.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =
1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital
capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting
for 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect. No causal effect was found for
periodontitis. These findings highlight a causal role of dental caries in lung
cancer risk and support integrating dental care and pulmonary function
monitoring into cancer prevention strategies.

Motivation: Bridging the performance gap between LMMs and specialist detectors in object detection tasks.

Method: Proposes LMM-Det, leveraging LMMs for object detection by adjusting data distribution and optimizing inference, without specialized modules.

Result: LMM-Det effectively improves recall rates, demonstrating LMMs' inherent detection capabilities.

Conclusion: LMM-Det proves LMMs can perform object detection without extra modules, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

*Xiaomei Zhang,Hanyu Zheng,Xiangyu Zhu,Jinghuan Wei,Junhong Zou,Zhen Lei,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FieldLVLM improves LVLMs for scientific field data with field-aware language generation and data-compressed tuning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs excel in general tasks but lack performance in scientific field data interpretation.

Method: FieldLVLM combines field-aware language generation (extracting key features) and data-compressed multimodal tuning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets for scientific field data tasks.

Conclusion: FieldLVLM bridges LVLMs and scientific research, enabling domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

*Minje Park,Jeonghwa Lim,Taehyung Yu,Sunghoon Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks semi-supervised learning for ECG delineation, comparing transformer and convolutional networks, and introduces standardized evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated ECG datasets hinder deep learning progress; semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data for better performance.

Method: Curated public datasets, implemented five SemiSeg algorithms on CNN and transformer architectures, and evaluated in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Result: Transformers outperform CNNs in semi-supervised ECG delineation.

Conclusion: The benchmark supports advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation and encourages further research.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Modified Nuclear Norm (MNN) framework is introduced for matrix recovery, capturing both local and global low-rank structures without parameter tuning, with proven recovery guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to jointly capture local and global low-rank structures in matrix recovery tasks like Robust PCA and matrix completion.

Method: The MNN framework applies transformations to the matrix and performs the nuclear norm on the transformed matrix, unifying local and global information.

Result: The MNN framework provides exact recovery guarantees under mild assumptions and outperforms existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MNN offers a flexible, unified approach for structured low-rank recovery, validated by theoretical guarantees and experiments.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Franck Ballerini,Stephania-Denisa Bocu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GVCCS, a new dataset for contrail tracking, and a deep learning framework to improve contrail analysis and climate impact modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrails significantly impact aviation's climate effect, but current models lack accurate data and tracking. Observational data is needed to validate and refine these models.

Method: The authors present GVCCS, a ground-based camera dataset with labeled and tracked contrails, and propose a deep learning framework for contrail segmentation and tracking.

Result: The dataset includes 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) with flight identifiers, enabling detailed contrail lifecycle analysis.

Conclusion: GVCCS and the proposed framework enhance contrail monitoring and model calibration, improving climate impact assessments.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

TL;DR: SGCDet is a multi-view indoor 3D object detection framework using adaptive 3D volume construction and dynamic view aggregation for improved feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of fixed voxel receptive fields and redundant computations in free space, enhancing 3D object detection efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Introduces a geometry and context-aware aggregation module for dynamic view contributions and a sparse volume construction strategy for feature refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ARKitScenes datasets.

Conclusion: SGCDet offers adaptive, efficient 3D volume construction and eliminates reliance on ground-truth scene geometry, advancing indoor 3D object detection.

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method improves bird species classification by embedding frequency information into spectrograms using colorization, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with bird song classification due to noise, overlapping vocalizations, and missing labels, especially in low-SNR or multi-species recordings.

Method: The approach visualizes bird songs using pitch, speed, and repetition (motifs) and enhances spectrograms by embedding frequency information via primary color additives.

Result: The method achieves significant gains: F1 (+7.3%), ROC-AUC (+6.2%), and CMAP (+6.6%), surpassing the BirdCLEF 2024 winner.

Conclusion: Colorizing spectrograms with frequency information effectively improves bird species classification accuracy.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

TL;DR: EgoExoBench is introduced as the first benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video understanding, evaluating MLLMs' cross-view reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and improve multimodal large language models' (MLLMs) ability to transfer knowledge between first-person and third-person viewpoints, a capability intrinsic to human intelligence.

Method: EgoExoBench, a benchmark with over 7,300 question-answer pairs across 11 sub-tasks, is created from public datasets to test MLLMs on semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning.

Result: Current MLLMs perform well on single-view tasks but struggle with cross-view reasoning, including semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: EgoExoBench serves as a valuable resource for advancing research on embodied agents and intelligent assistants with human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Motivation: Addressing fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices in bias mitigation research for fairer AI systems.

Method: Introduces VB-Mitigator, a framework with 12 mitigation methods, 7 datasets, and extensible features for integration.

Result: Provides a unified environment for reproducible research and comparative analysis of bias mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: VB-Mitigator accelerates fairness-aware computer vision research by offering a foundational, extensible codebase and best practices.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deformable convolutional module using attention and feedforward networks learns offsets for global feature deformation, improving fundus blood vessel segmentation with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address complex shape features in fundus blood vessels by capturing long-distance global features through deformable convolution.

Method: Proposes a plug-and-play deformable convolutional module that learns sub-pixel displacement fields and warps feature maps adaptively across channels.

Result: GDCUnet, the model using this module, achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The module enhances feature learning and generalization, suggesting broader application in machine vision tasks with complex global features.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

TL;DR: MVG4D is a novel framework for generating high-fidelity, temporally consistent 4D content from a single image using multi-view synthesis and 4D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-quality dynamic 4D content remains challenging due to issues like motion discontinuity and background degradation.

Method: MVG4D combines multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting, using an image matrix module for coherent multi-view images and a deformation network for temporal extension.

Result: MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like CLIP-I, PSNR, and FVD, reducing flickering and enhancing details.

Conclusion: MVG4D advances efficient and controllable 4D generation, improving AR/VR experiences.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration for physical task completion has significant

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel one-stage architecture for pose generation eliminates intermediate representations, improving long-term coherence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods degrade in long-term pose generation due to reliance on intermediate representations or autoregressive models.

Method: Directly generates poses in continuous space from an RGB image and text, using relative movement prediction and unified placeholder tokens.

Result: Outperforms quantization-based and autoregressive methods on Penn Action and F-PHAB datasets, especially in long-term scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed one-stage approach avoids intermediate steps, ensuring consistent performance and coherence in pose generation.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenHumanBRDF, a high-quality dataset for full-body human inverse rendering, and proposes HumanMaterial, a model with progressive training and a Controlled PBR Rendering loss to improve material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for human inverse rendering lack realism, especially for skin, due to simplified datasets and rendering equations. The goal is to enhance realism by using better data and training strategies.

Method: Constructed OpenHumanBRDF dataset with detailed material maps (e.g., displacement, subsurface scattering). Designed HumanMaterial model with progressive training and CPR loss to optimize material estimation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data, improving rendering realism, particularly for skin.

Conclusion: The combination of a high-quality dataset and the HumanMaterial model significantly advances human inverse rendering, addressing previous limitations in realism and material estimation.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Method: Uses interleaved window attention and depthwise separable convolution to connect distant and neighboring tokens, respectively, in a single module.

Result: Achieves 87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, excels in segmentation and video tasks, and works as a standalone module for image generation.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer is a competitive alternative to Swin Transformer, with potential applications in future research like video generation.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and
methods introduced by the Iwin Transformer have the potential to inspire future

*Xun Ye,Ruixiang Tang,Mingda Zhang,Jianglong Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFFSNet introduces a feature space decoupling strategy to balance connectivity and other features, outperforming existing models in medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep networks integrating connectivity lack standardized mechanisms to quantify feature strengths, leading to coupled feature spaces.

Method: Proposes DCFFSNet with a feature space decoupling strategy and dynamic multi-scale feature balancing architecture.

Result: Outperforms top models on ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets, improving Dice and IoU scores.

Conclusion: DCFFSNet resolves segmentation fragmentation, enhances edge transitions, and improves clinical usability.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg

*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using V-JEPA, a self-supervised learning framework, for ultrasound video segmentation, enhancing it with a 3D localization task to improve ViT performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in acquiring and annotating ultrasound datasets due to noise and artefacts motivate the use of SSL to leverage unlabelled data for better segmentation with limited annotations.

Method: Adopts V-JEPA for ultrasound video data, introduces a 3D localization auxiliary task to address ViT limitations in medical datasets, and evaluates segmentation performance.

Result: V-JEPA with the auxiliary task improves segmentation, achieving gains of 3.4% with full data and 8.35% with 10% of training data.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates V-JEPA's suitability for ultrasound imaging and the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary task in enhancing segmentation performance.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

*Mahdi Ghafourian,Federico M. Sukno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deep learning method, NLML-HPE, uses tensor decomposition and neural networks for head pose estimation with limited data, addressing annotation issues and achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head pose estimation is crucial for applications like human-computer interaction, but existing datasets often have inaccurate annotations, and traditional methods rely on classification rather than regression.

Method: Combines tensor decomposition (Tucker) and feed-forward neural networks to model pose angles as regression, using cosine curves for manifold learning. A precise 2D dataset was created by rotating 3D models.

Result: Achieves real-time performance with limited training data, accurately predicting pose angles from facial landmarks.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE effectively addresses annotation challenges and data limitations, offering a fast and accurate solution for head pose estimation.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining Dual-Scale-Former (DSFormer) and block clustering improves Visual Place Recognition (VPR) robustness and efficiency, reducing training data needs by 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in VPR under varying conditions and viewpoints to enhance mobile robot localization.

Method: Integrates DSFormer for bidirectional feature learning and block clustering to optimize dataset organization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforms methods like DELG and Patch-NetVLAD, and improves computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework enhances VPR robustness and efficiency, reducing data requirements while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB-Eval, a benchmark for understanding driver behavior using Large Multimodal Models (MLLMs), improving zero-shot QA performance by 73.2% and enhancing intention prediction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of datasets explaining driver behavior from external visual evidence and improve safety systems.

Method: Proposes PDB-Eval with two components: PDB-X for temporal scene understanding and PDB-QA for visual explanation QA to fine-tune MLLMs.

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs on PDB-Eval improves zero-shot QA by 73.2%, turn intention prediction by 12.5%, and AIDE tasks by up to 11.0%.

Conclusion: PDB-Eval effectively bridges the gap between MLLMs and driving tasks, enhancing performance in behavior understanding and safety applications.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of physical realizability and reproducibility in existing adversarial attacks on LiDAR systems.

Method: Proposing a device-agnostic framework with open-source code and benchmarking protocols for simulation and real-world validation.

Result: Successful transfer of simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system, with insights into attack success factors.

Conclusion: The framework accelerates research and improves understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

TL;DR: CRUISE is a framework for reconstructing and augmenting V2X driving scenes using decomposed Gaussian Splatting, improving 3D detection and generating corner cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of simulation for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios is underexplored, despite its importance for autonomous driving.

Method: CRUISE uses decomposed Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct real-world scenes and supports flexible editing of dynamic traffic participants. It renders images from multiple views for dataset augmentation.

Result: CRUISE achieves high-fidelity scene reconstruction, improves 3D detection and tracking, and generates challenging corner cases.

Conclusion: CRUISE effectively enhances V2X data generation and augmentation, benefiting autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Q-Former Autoencoder, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for medical images, leveraging pretrained vision models like DINO and Masked Autoencoder without fine-tuning. It achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in medical images is challenging due to diverse anomalies and lack of annotated data. The work aims to utilize pretrained vision models for robust feature extraction without domain-specific tuning.

Method: The Q-Former Autoencoder uses frozen pretrained vision models (DINO, DINOv2, Masked Autoencoder) as feature extractors. It employs Q-Former for bottleneck control and multiscale feature aggregation, with perceptual loss from Masked Autoencoder for semantic reconstruction.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA benchmarks, demonstrating effective generalization of pretrained models to medical tasks.

Conclusion: Pretrained vision models can generalize well to medical anomaly detection without fine-tuning, offering a powerful tool for unsupervised tasks. Code and models are publicly released.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

TL;DR: The paper introduces an enhanced NIH malaria dataset with detailed COCO-format annotations to improve deep learning-based malaria detection, achieving strong performance with Faster R-CNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable malaria diagnosis in developing countries requires accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in blood smears, but limited annotated datasets hinder deep learning adoption.

Method: The authors refined the NIH malaria dataset with detailed bounding box annotations, trained a Faster R-CNN model, and validated it via cross-validation.

Result: The model achieved an F1 score of 0.88 for infected cell detection, highlighting the importance of annotation quality.

Conclusion: Automated annotation refinement and manual correction can produce high-quality training data, and the updated dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The
updated annotations set is publicly available via GitHub:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein-EAD is a proactive defense framework for 3D adversarial attacks, using adaptive exploration and interaction to improve robustness, outperforming passive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of passive defense strategies in dynamic 3D adversarial settings by introducing an active, adaptive approach.

Method: Leverages multi-step objectives balancing accuracy and entropy minimization, with uncertainty-oriented reward shaping for efficient policy updates.

Result: Significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining standard accuracy, generalizing well to unseen and adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD is effective for real-world 3D adversarial defense, suitable for tasks like object classification, face recognition, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

*Si-Woo Kim,MinJu Jeon,Ye-Chan Kim,Soeun Lee,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynC is a framework designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) by reassigning captions to semantically aligned images, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset pruning methods are unsuitable for synthetic data, where captions are well-formed but images may misalign semantically. SynC addresses this gap.

Method: SynC uses a one-to-many mapping strategy to retrieve candidate images for each caption and selects the best match via cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scoring.

Result: SynC significantly improves ZIC model performance on benchmarks like MS-COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SynC provides an effective strategy for refining synthetic data to enhance ZIC, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Motivation: To address the uncertainty in online-generated HD maps and improve trajectory prediction by identifying critical scenarios where map uncertainty is beneficial.

Method: Proposes Proprioceptive Scenario Gating to adaptively integrate map uncertainty based on ego vehicle kinematics and introduces a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach.

Result: Achieves up to 23.6% improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The method enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability and outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our

Motivation: To improve human-like attention modeling by integrating deep object detection and probabilistic semantic fusion for dynamic attention map generation.

Method: SemBA-FAST combines deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic fusion mechanism, using pre-trained detectors and artificial foveation for sequential fixation prediction.

Result: The model achieves human-like scanpaths on COCO-Search18, surpassing baselines and competing with scanpath-informed models.

Conclusion: SemBA-FAST demonstrates the potential of semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down
and bottom-up cues. At the same time, foveal vision plays a crucial role in
directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal
probabilistic frameworks for human-like attention modelling, with implications

Motivation: To enable quantitative comparison of SAE-derived features across different modalities and investigate shared representations among visual, textual, and multimodal encoders.

Method: Proposes a new indicator for cross-modality SAE feature comparison and a metric for feature sharedness. Evaluates 21 encoders of varying sizes and datasets.

Result: Reveals shared features between visual and text encoders, influenced by text pretraining, and revisits previous studies in a multimodal context.

Conclusion: The study provides tools for cross-modality SAE feature analysis, highlighting shared representations and the role of text pretraining in feature alignment.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of detecting rare objects in remote sensing data by focusing on bio-digesters in France. It introduces a novel dataset and a part-based method to improve detection, then estimates methane production from these sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to tackle the difficulty of detecting rare objects (like bio-digesters) in large-scale remote sensing data, which is crucial for applications such as environmental impact assessment.

Method: A part-based method is developed, focusing on sub-elements of bio-digesters to enhance detection. The method is tested on a novel dataset with imbalanced training and validation sets.

Result: The method successfully detects bio-digesters in unseen regions, enabling the creation of an inventory. Geostatistical estimates of methane production from these sites are also computed.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the challenge of rare object detection in remote sensing and provides actionable insights for environmental impact assessment.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote
sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost

TL;DR: The paper explores using foundation models for semantic object segmentation without fine-tuning, focusing on cluttered scenes for neuroprostheses. A gaze-based prompt method for SAM improves IoU by 0.51 on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to leverage foundation models for object segmentation in cluttered scenes, targeting vision-guided upper limb neuroprostheses, without needing fine-tuning on specific images.

Method: Proposes gaze fixation-based prompts to guide SAM for segmentation, fine-tuning it on egocentric visual data.

Result: Achieves a 0.51-point improvement in IoU segmentation quality on the Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances segmentation in cluttered scenes, demonstrating potential for real-world neuroprosthetic applications.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data
of Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus which is made available on the RoboFlow Platform

TL;DR: GaussianFusionOcc introduces a 3D semantic occupancy prediction method using semantic 3D Gaussians and multi-modal sensor fusion for autonomous driving, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance autonomous driving by enabling precise and safe navigation in complex environments through effective multi-modal sensor fusion.

Method: Uses semantic 3D Gaussians and modality-agnostic deformable attention to fuse data from cameras, LiDAR, and radar, refining Gaussian properties for accurate environment representation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating versatility with various sensor combinations.

Conclusion: GaussianFusionOcc combines robust multi-modal fusion and efficient Gaussian representation for superior 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IntentVCNet bridges the spatio-temporal gap in LVLMs for fine-grained intent-oriented video captioning using prompt combination and a box adapter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack fine-grained spatial control in time sequences for intent-oriented video captioning.

Method: Proposes a prompt combination strategy and a parameter-efficient box adapter to unify temporal and spatial understanding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results and runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

Conclusion: The method enhances LVLMs' ability to generate accurate intent-oriented captions.

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

TL;DR: EDA expands diffusion models to arbitrary noise patterns, improving image restoration without extra computational cost, outperforming task-specific methods in MRI, CT, and natural image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed Gaussian noise in EDM limits image restoration by corrupting degraded images and increasing complexity.

Method: EDA extends EDM to arbitrary noise patterns, preserving flexibility and proving no added computational cost.

Result: EDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in MRI bias correction, CT artifact reduction, and shadow removal with just 5 sampling steps.

Conclusion: EDA enhances diffusion models for diverse noise patterns, offering efficient, high-quality image restoration.

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

TL;DR: TTS-VAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models, improving efficiency and performance through adaptive batch sizing, clustering-based diversity search, and resampling-based potential selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of scaling visual generation models while maintaining performance, focusing on test-time scaling for efficiency.

Method: Models generation as path searching, using adaptive batch sizing, clustering for diversity at coarse scales, and resampling with potential scores at fine scales.

Result: Achieves an 8.7% improvement in GenEval score (0.69 to 0.75) on the Infinity VAR model.

Conclusion: Early-stage structural features impact final quality, and resampling effectiveness varies by scale, validating TTS-VAR's approach.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

TL;DR: A novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework integrates MVS priors and probabilistic Procrustes mapping to address memory and accuracy issues in large-scale outdoor image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS models struggle with memory limits and accuracy in unposed reconstruction from hundreds of outdoor images.

Method: Partitions images into subsets, maps submaps globally using probabilistic Procrustes, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS.

Result: Achieves accurate reconstruction and pose estimation on Waymo and KITTI datasets, setting a new state of the art.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of MVS models, enabling scalable and accurate unposed 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative MRI registration is challenging due to modality differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view.

Method: Patient-specific synthetic iUS volumes are generated from MRI for supervised contrastive training. A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy and curriculum-based triplet loss are used to learn robust descriptors.

Result: Achieves 69.8% average precision in keypoint matching and 2.39 mm mean Target Registration Error on the ReMIND2Reg benchmark.

Conclusion: The method is interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and is robust to iUS field-of-view variation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Motivation: To address the lack of datasets providing deep-cognitive video understanding, especially intent expressions requiring contextual integration.

Method: The dataset includes 103K video samples with audio and hierarchical textual descriptions (factual, abstract, intent) generated via Chain-of-Thought (COT). Annotations cover subject, place, time, event, action, and intent.

Result: A gold-standard benchmark with 3K manually validated samples and evaluation results for models like InternVideo, VAST, and UMT-L.

Conclusion: VideoMind advances deep video understanding and serves as a benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment, with publicly available data.

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

Synthetic data significantly enhances segmentation performance, offering a solution to data scarcity and manual annotation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of chicken carcasses is crucial for quality control and efficiency in poultry processing, but deep learning models face challenges due to the need for large annotated datasets.

Method: The study presents a pipeline for creating synthetic images and a benchmark dataset. It evaluates instance segmentation models using a mix of real and synthetic data.

Result: Synthetic data significantly improves segmentation performance across all tested models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation is an effective strategy to address data scarcity and reduce manual annotation, advancing AI-driven detection in poultry processing.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Motivation: Enhance targeted advertising by accurately classifying age and gender from facial images.

Method: Custom CNN architecture optimized for both tasks, trained on a diverse dataset with robust pre-processing.

Result: 95% gender classification accuracy and 5.77 years mean absolute error for age estimation. Challenges in younger age groups noted.

Conclusion: The approach is effective but requires refinement for younger individuals. Insights on architectures and hyperparameters provided for future work.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for demorphing face images, overcoming replication issues and handling unseen morph techniques, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demorphing methods struggle with morph replication and assume identical morph techniques for training and testing, limiting their practical use.

Method: Decomposes morphs in latent space, trained on synthetic faces, and tested on real faces with arbitrary morph techniques.

Result: Outperforms existing methods significantly, producing high-fidelity demorphed images.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively demorphs faces, even for unseen techniques, enhancing morph attack detection.

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

TL;DR: DMDX improves score distillation by combining adversarial pre-training and fine-tuning, outperforming DMD2 in one-step performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse in DMD due to reverse KL divergence, ADM is proposed for better score distillation.

Method: ADM uses diffusion-based discriminators for adversarial alignment. Hybrid discriminators in latent and pixel spaces improve one-step distillation.

Result: DMDX achieves superior one-step performance on SDXL and sets benchmarks for efficient image/video synthesis.

Conclusion: ADM and DMDX enhance distillation efficiency and performance, advancing one-step and multi-step synthesis.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in attention but struggle with long-range dependencies due to quadratic complexity, while Mamba offers linear complexity but lacks feature representation. Combining these strengths is challenging.

Method: Proposes HybridTM, a hybrid architecture integrating Transformer and Mamba, and the Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy for finer granularity in feature capture.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybridTM effectively combines Transformer and Mamba, demonstrating superior performance and generalization in 3D semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,

Motivation: Low-light image enhancement struggles with preserving edge continuity and fine details under extreme illumination degradation.

Result: DRWKV leads in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE on five benchmarks and enhances downstream multi-object tracking.

Conclusion: DRWKV effectively addresses low-light enhancement challenges, offering superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in
preserving object edge continuity and fine structural details under extreme
illumination degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV
(Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global
Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization

### [88] [3D Software Synthesis Guided by Constraint-Expressive Intermediate Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18625)
*Shuqing Li,Anson Y. Lam,Yun Peng,Wenxuan Wang,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scenethesis introduces a requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach using ScenethesisLang, enabling fine-grained control and constraint handling, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and visual evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from 2D to 3D UI software lacks efficient generation methods, especially for modifying specific elements and handling complex spatial/semantic constraints.

Method: Scenethesis uses ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language, as an intermediate representation to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software, enabling staged synthesis and constraint satisfaction.

Result: Scenethesis captures 80% of user requirements, satisfies 90% of hard constraints, and improves visual evaluation scores by 42.8% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Scenethesis effectively addresses the challenges of 3D software generation, offering precise control, constraint handling, and significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

### [89] [SIDA: Synthetic Image Driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18632)
*Ye-Chan Kim,SeungJu Cha,Si-Woo Kim,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDA introduces a zero-shot domain adaptation method using synthetic images instead of text descriptions, improving efficiency and capturing real-world variations better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven methods for zero-shot domain adaptation struggle with complex variations and slow adaptation. Image data offers finer style cues.

Method: SIDA generates synthetic images via source-like images and style translation, then uses Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer modules for adaptation.

Result: SIDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios and reduces adaptation time significantly.

Conclusion: SIDA is an efficient and effective solution for zero-shot domain adaptation, outperforming text-driven methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

*Grace Su,Sheng-Yu Wang,Aaron Hertzmann,Eli Shechtman,Jun-Yan Zhu,Richard Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for recognizing artists from images generated by text-to-image models, covering 110 artists and four generalization settings, with evaluations of various methods and public release of the dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the controversial use of text-to-image models by explicitly naming artists and provide a tool for responsible moderation.

Method: Developed a dataset of 1.95M images from 110 artists, evaluated feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.

Result: Supervised and few-shot models perform well on seen artists and complex prompts, while style descriptors excel for pronounced styles; multi-artist prompts are the most challenging.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights significant room for improvement and aims to advance responsible moderation of text-to-image models, with the dataset publicly released for further research.

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

*Junfei Xiao,Ceyuan Yang,Lvmin Zhang,Shengqu Cai,Yang Zhao,Yuwei Guo,Gordon Wetzstein,Maneesh Agrawala,Alan Yuille,Lu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Captain Cinema is a framework for generating short movies from textual descriptions using top-down keyframe planning and bottom-up video synthesis with MM-DiT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the creation of visually coherent and narrative-consistent short movies efficiently.

Method: Combines top-down keyframe planning for long-range coherence and bottom-up video synthesis using MM-DiT with interleaved training.

Result: Produces high-quality, coherent short movies efficiently.

Conclusion: Captain Cinema effectively automates cinematic content generation with visual and narrative consistency.

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

### [92] [ASP-Assisted Symbolic Regression: Uncovering Hidden Physics in Fluid Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17777)
*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Symbolic Regression (SR) is used to model 3D incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, yielding interpretable equations that match analytical solutions. A hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between accurate prediction and understanding of flow physics in fluid mechanics.

Method: Applied SR via PySR to derive symbolic equations from simulation data, then integrated with Answer Set Programming (ASP) for physical plausibility.

Result: SR produced compact equations matching analytical solutions; the hybrid SR/ASP framework improved reliability.

Conclusion: SR simplifies complex flows into interpretable equations, and knowledge-representation (ASP) enhances alignment with domain principles.

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: I2I-STRADA introduces a structured reasoning agent for data analysis, outperforming prior systems by formalizing cognitive workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack structured reasoning for analytical tasks, despite their automation capabilities.

Method: I2I-STRADA models analytical reasoning via modular sub-tasks, aligning with cognitive steps like goal interpretation and adaptive execution.

Result: Outperforms prior systems in planning coherence and insight alignment on DABstep and DABench benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured cognitive workflows are crucial for effective agentic systems in data analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

TL;DR: SmartAPS is a conversational system using LLMs to make advanced planning systems more accessible via natural language chat.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional APS systems are costly due to consultant fees, limiting accessibility for supply chain planners.

Method: SmartAPS leverages a tool-augmented LLM to provide a natural language interface for querying, reasoning, and scenario analysis.

Result: The system enables planners to interact intuitively with APS functionalities without high costs.

Conclusion: SmartAPS democratizes access to APS by combining LLMs with conversational interfaces, enhancing usability and affordability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

*Dario Della Monica,Angelo Montanari,Pietro Sala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning that maps to deterministic finite automata (DFA) for strategy synthesis, avoiding costly nondeterministic automata determinization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of nondeterministic automata in synthesizing planning strategies due to the required determinization step.

Method: Mapping the plan-existence problem of a specific qualitative timeline-based planning fragment to the nonemptiness problem of DFA.

Result: A deterministic fragment is identified, along with a maximal subset of Allen's relations fitting this fragment.

Conclusion: The deterministic fragment enables direct strategy synthesis using DFA, improving efficiency over nondeterministic approaches.

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage pipeline that leverages model-generated errors for creativity, showing significant improvements in novelty, relevance, and human evaluation scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move AI beyond imitation by harnessing errors as creative assets, inspired by cognitive science and generative modeling.

Method: Uses the E.A.R.T.H. framework (Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, Harness feedback) with tools like LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, and CLIP, employing a reward function based on novelty, surprise, and relevance.

Result: Creativity scores improved by 52.5%, with refined outputs showing 70.4% improvement. Slogans were 48.4% shorter and 40.7% more novel, with strong cross-modal alignment and positive human feedback.

Conclusion: Error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances AI creativity, offering a scalable approach for human-aligned creative AI.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether charts and graphs, which aid human data analysis, can also enhance AI system performance.

Method: Experiments with GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 on three analysis tasks, comparing performance with and without scatterplots, blank charts, and mismatched charts.

Result: AI systems describe datasets more precisely and accurately with scatterplots, with improvements linked to chart content.

Conclusion: Visualizations benefit AI systems similarly to humans, as evidenced by improved performance with scatterplots.

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTDE methods underutilize centralized training or lack theoretical guarantees.

Method: MAGPO integrates centralized guidance with decentralized execution, using an auto-regressive joint policy for exploration and aligning it with decentralized policies.

Result: MAGPO outperforms CTDE baselines and matches/surpasses centralized approaches in 43 tasks across 6 environments.

Conclusion: MAGPO provides a principled, practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our
code and experimental data can be found in https://github.com/liyheng/MAGPO.

Motivation: The bottleneck in AI research due to human cognitive limits necessitates autonomous systems to accelerate innovation.

Method: ASI-Arch autonomously hypothesizes, implements, trains, and validates novel neural architectures, conducting 1,773 experiments over 20,000 GPU hours.

Result: Discovered 106 innovative SOTA linear attention architectures with emergent design principles surpassing human baselines.

Conclusion: ASI-Arch demonstrates scalable scientific discovery, transforming AI research into a computation-driven process.

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An Agentic AI framework automates clinical data pipelines, handling structured and unstructured data for feature extraction, model selection, and preprocessing, reducing manual effort in healthcare ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and labor-intensive workflows in healthcare ML due to fragmented preprocessing, model compatibility, and privacy constraints.

Method: Modular, task-specific agents automate data ingestion, anonymization, feature extraction, model selection, preprocessing, and inference.

Result: Evaluated on geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy datasets, the framework reduces expert intervention and scales AI deployment.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, cost-efficient solution for automating ML workflows in clinical settings.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

TL;DR: The study uses NLP and Active Learning to create a classifier for detecting vaccine safety issues from ED triage notes, improving surveillance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines highlighted the need for better post-licensure safety surveillance due to limited clinical trial data.

Method: Combines NLP, Active Learning, and data augmentation to develop a classifier for analyzing ED triage notes.

Result: The approach aims to enhance accuracy and efficiency in detecting vaccine safety signals compared to keyword-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed classifier can significantly improve timely vaccine safety surveillance using ED notes.

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

### [102] [Logical Characterizations of GNNs with Mean Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18145)
*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mean GNNs match ratio modal logic in non-uniform settings, surpassing max GNNs but lagging behind sum GNNs. Uniformly, they align with alternation-free modal logic under specific conditions, showing lower expressiveness than sum and max GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the expressive capabilities of GNNs using mean aggregation compared to other aggregation functions (sum, max) and their relation to modal logic.

Method: Analyzed expressive power of mean GNNs in non-uniform and uniform settings, comparing them to max and sum GNNs using modal logic frameworks.

Result: Mean GNNs are less expressive than sum GNNs but more expressive than max GNNs in non-uniform settings. Uniformly, they are less expressive than both under certain conditions.

Conclusion: Mean GNNs have distinct expressive power, influenced by aggregation function and setting, with implications for their application in graph-based tasks.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to decouple knowledge and reasoning in LLMs using dual-system cognitive theory, analyzing their contributions across different cognitive modes and model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in LLMs for better model analysis, interpretability, and development.

Method: Decomposes LLM cognition into knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2), prompting models under fast and slow thinking modes to analyze performance.

Result: (1) Reasoning is domain-specific, aiding reasoning-heavy domains but potentially harming knowledge-heavy ones. (2) Scaling improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge gains more significant. (3) Knowledge is in lower layers, reasoning in higher layers.

Conclusion: The framework offers insights into LLM behavior, scaling laws, and hierarchical knowledge editing, advancing understanding of model limitations and capabilities.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [104] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares four non-minimal semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming, showing three coincide and are stronger than the fourth, which aligns with classical logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that do not rely on model minimality, unlike stable models.

Method: Comparison of four approaches: Justified Models, Strongly Supported Models, Forks, and Determining Inference semantics, analyzing their relationships and strengths.

Result: Three approaches (Forks, Justified Models, and a relaxed DI semantics) coincide and provide a superset of stable models, while the fourth (Strongly Supported Models) aligns with classical logic.

Conclusion: The study identifies a common semantics among three approaches, stronger than the fourth, offering insights into non-minimal disjunction semantics.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

*Antonino Rotolo,Beatrice Ferrigno,Jose Miguel Angel Garcia Godinez,Claudio Novelli,Giovanni Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A conceptual framework for qualitative AI risk assessment under the EU AI Act, combining definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning to address legal compliance and rights protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the complexities of AI risk assessment in legal contexts, ensuring compliance with the EU AI Act and safeguarding fundamental rights.

Method: Integrates definitional balancing (proportionality analysis) and defeasible reasoning to analyze AI deployment scenarios, legal violations, and rights impacts.

Result: Provides philosophical foundations for AI risk analysis, enabling operative models for high-risk and General Purpose AI systems.

Conclusion: Future work will develop formal models and algorithms to enhance practical AI risk assessment and governance.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method for automatically marking Physics exams using a combination of computer algebra, SMT solving, term rewriting, and LLMs to assess student answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the challenging task of assessing typed student answers against ground truth solutions in Physics exams.

Method: Combines a computer algebra system, SMT solver, term rewriting system, and LLM to formalize and assess student responses.

Result: Evaluated on 1500+ real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Conclusion: The system effectively automates Physics exam marking, leveraging diverse reasoning techniques.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

TL;DR: ConDiFi is a benchmark evaluating divergent and convergent reasoning in LLMs for finance, revealing performance gaps among models like GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and Cohere Command R+.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on factual accuracy, but finance requires creative and logical reasoning under uncertainty.

Method: ConDiFi includes 607 prompts for divergent reasoning and 990 multi-hop MCQs for convergent reasoning, tested on 14 models.

Result: GPT-4o underperforms in Novelty and Actionability, while DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ excel in actionable insights.

Conclusion: ConDiFi offers a new way to assess reasoning for safe and strategic LLM use in finance.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

### [108] [Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391)
*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Kai Jia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO), a theoretical framework for improving LLM reasoning using the information bottleneck principle, and proposes a lightweight regularization method for practical implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reinforcement learning approaches for LLM reasoning are heuristic and lack principled methodologies, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The paper presents IBRO, a framework grounded in the information bottleneck principle, and introduces a token-level surrogate objective with an efficient approximation (IB regularization).

Result: Empirical validation shows consistent improvements in LLM reasoning performance across benchmarks and RL algorithms.

Conclusion: IB regularization enhances LLM reasoning by ensuring informative and generalizable reasoning trajectories, with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

*Kwong Ho Li,Wathsala Karunarathne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares model-based (Value Iteration) and model-free (Proximal Policy Optimization) RL methods for call routing optimization, finding PPO superior in minimizing waiting and idle times despite longer training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize call routing in call centers by minimizing client waiting time and staff idle time using Reinforcement Learning.

Method: Two approaches: model-based (Value Iteration with known dynamics) and model-free (PPO learning from experience). Both use MDP in a Skills-Based Routing framework with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times.

Result: PPO achieves the highest rewards, lowest waiting time, and lowest idle time after 1,000 test episodes, though it requires longer training.

Conclusion: PPO is more effective than Value Iteration for optimizing call routing, despite its longer training duration.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm for table constraints in constraint programming by leveraging GPU acceleration to handle large-scale problems efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CPU-based approaches struggle with real-world problems involving hundreds or thousands of cases in table constraints, necessitating more efficient solutions.

Method: The authors enhance the CT algorithm using GPU computational power, detailing its design, implementation, and integration into an existing constraint solver.

Result: Experimental validation on a significant set of instances demonstrates the effectiveness of GPU-accelerated CT.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration significantly improves the handling of large table constraints, making the enhanced CT algorithm a practical solution for complex problems.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of training data on concept probing models in image classification, addressing a gap in current research, and releases concept labels for two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of neural networks by focusing on the data used for training concept probing models, an underexplored area.

Method: Investigates the effect of training data on probing model performance in image classification tasks.

Result: Highlights the importance of training data in concept probing and provides concept labels for two datasets.

Conclusion: Training data significantly affects concept probing performance, and the release of labeled datasets aids future research.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Motivation: To address the limitations of previous alignment methods like RLHF by enabling intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection in AI models.

Method: Uses the SafeLadder framework with progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning and multi-principled verifiers, along with inference-time interventions and deliberative search.

Result: SafeWork-R1 improves safety by 46.54% over its base model and outperforms proprietary models like GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4.

Conclusion: The SafeLadder framework demonstrates that safety and capability can co-evolve, offering a robust approach for developing trustworthy AI.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

TL;DR: Shop-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning for simulating human behavior in online shopping by decomposing tasks into rationale generation and action prediction, using distinct rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of LLM-generated rationales by improving reasoning capabilities for realistic human behavior simulation in web environments.

Method: Decomposes the task into rationale generation (self-supervised) and action prediction (hierarchical reward structure). Uses internal model signals and difficulty-aware scaling.

Result: Achieves a 65% relative improvement over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Shop-R1 effectively enhances LLM reasoning for human behavior simulation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: DG-PRM introduces a dynamic and generalizable process reward model using a reward tree and Pareto dominance estimation, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks and showing strong generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs rely on heuristic approaches and lack cross-domain generalization, while LLM-as-judge overlooks meaningful guidance in text. Static evaluation criteria also fail in complex process supervision.

Method: DG-PRM uses a reward tree for fine-grained, multi-dimensional criteria and dynamically selects step-wise rewards. Pareto dominance estimation identifies discriminative positive/negative pairs.

Result: DG-PRM achieves superior performance on benchmarks, significantly improving model performance with dense rewards and adapting well to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DG-PRM addresses limitations of existing PRMs with dynamic and generalizable reward modeling, demonstrating exceptional performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of cognitive biases in analytical questions posed by users without statistical backgrounds.

Method: Introduces a contextual semantic mapping framework, an analytical framework based on the Hard-to-Vary principle, and an optimized LLM-powered system for generating high-quality prompts.

Result: 82.5% of users reported improved analysis quality; VeriMinder outperformed alternatives by at least 20% in concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.

Conclusion: VeriMinder effectively mitigates 'wrong question' vulnerabilities in data analysis and is available as open-source for further research.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,

Motivation: To simplify and improve ASA for multi-part second-language tests, making it practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted Language Learning systems by eliminating transcription and per-part models.

Method: Uses a single Whisper-small encoder to process all spoken responses, combines information via a lightweight aggregator, and employs a data sampling strategy for training efficiency.

Result: Achieved RMSE of 0.384, outperforming the text-based baseline (0.44) with 70% of Whisper-small's parameters. Data sampling reduced training to 44.8% of speakers while maintaining performance (0.383 RMSE).

Conclusion: The system is efficient, scalable, and effective for ASA, demonstrating strong performance with reduced computational and data requirements.

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

*Hulayyil Alshammari,Praveen Rao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates six AI detection tools' ability to identify text generated by DeepSeek, testing robustness against adversarial attacks like paraphrasing and humanization. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in literature about DeepSeek's detectability and assess the robustness of AI detectors against adversarial attacks.

Method: Tested six AI detection tools on original, paraphrased, and humanized DeepSeek-generated text, and evaluated DeepSeek's own detection capabilities using few-shot and CoT prompting.

Result: QuillBot and Copyleaks performed well on original/paraphrased text, but humanization reduced accuracy. Few-shot and CoT prompting achieved high accuracy (96% AI recall, 100% human recall).

Conclusion: AI detectors vary in robustness, with humanization being the most effective attack. DeepSeek's detection via prompting shows promise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

TL;DR: Larger language models align better with Bayes' theorem when updating beliefs in-context, measured by a new Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if larger, more capable language models update beliefs more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with evidence.

Method: Formulated the BCC metric, generated a dataset, and measured BCC across multiple pre-trained models, comparing against parameters, training data, and benchmark scores.

Result: Larger and more capable models show more coherent credence assignments with Bayes' theorem.

Conclusion: Findings impact understanding and governance of LLMs, suggesting improved coherence in belief updates with scale.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding.
In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid
inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are
dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing
significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to
the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models

### [121] [NeuralDB: Scaling Knowledge Editing in LLMs to 100,000 Facts with Neural KV Database](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18028)
*Weizhi Fei,Hao Shi,Jing Xu,Jingchen Peng,Jiazheng Li,Jingzhao Zhang,Bo Bai,Wei Han,Zhenyuan Chen,Xueyan Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB, a non-linear gated retrieval framework, efficiently edits large language models (LLMs) while preserving their general abilities, outperforming linear methods at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of linear Locate-and-Edit (L&E) methods, which compromise LLM general abilities and fail at scale, by modeling edits as a neural Key-Value database.

Method: Proposes NeuralDB, a framework representing edited facts as a neural KV database with a non-linear gated retrieval module, activated only for edited facts.

Result: NeuralDB excels in editing efficacy, generalization, specificity, fluency, and consistency, and preserves performance across tasks, even scaling to 100,000 facts.

Conclusion: NeuralDB offers a scalable and effective solution for editing LLMs without compromising their general capabilities.

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [122] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS is an inference-time steering method for LLMs and VLMs that uses gradient-based attribution to identify influential tokens and adjusts activations for improved performance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time steering methods rely on fixed vectors, ignore token-level causal influence, and underutilize gradients, especially in multimodal settings.

Method: GrAInS employs contrastive, gradient-based attribution (Integrated Gradients) to identify top-k influential tokens and constructs directional steering vectors. It adjusts hidden activations during inference while preserving scale.

Result: GrAInS outperforms fine-tuning and baselines: 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA, reduced hallucination rates (0.624 to 0.514), and 8.11% alignment win rate improvement.

Conclusion: GrAInS provides fine-grained, interpretable control over model behavior without retraining, enhancing performance while preserving fluency and capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

*Hoyeon Lee,Sejung Son,Ye-Eun Kang,Jong-Hwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, reducing reliance on costly manual annotations and addressing speech domain challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for phrase break prediction require extensive human annotations, which are costly and inconsistent due to speech variability. LLMs offer a promising solution by generating synthetic data.

Method: The study leverages LLMs to create synthetic phrase break annotations, comparing them with traditional annotations and evaluating effectiveness across multiple languages.

Result: LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively reduces data challenges in phrase break prediction and shows potential for broader speech domain applications.

Conclusion: LLMs are a viable solution for generating synthetic annotations in phrase break prediction, offering cost-effective and scalable alternatives to manual methods.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the diversity and privacy risks of synthetic data from LLMs, proposes metrics for assessment, and introduces a prompt-based method to improve diversity while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored diversity and privacy risks of synthetic data generated by LLMs, which is increasingly used in data-driven applications.

Method: Proposes metrics to assess diversity (linguistic expression, sentiment, user perspective) and privacy (re-identification risk, stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets. Introduces a prompt-based approach to enhance diversity and privacy.

Result: Experiments show LLMs have limitations in generating diverse and privacy-preserving synthetic data. The prompt-based method improves diversity while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for better evaluation and generation methods for synthetic data, offering a practical solution to enhance diversity and privacy.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

*Zehan Li,Hongjie Chen,Yuxin Zhang,Jing Zhou,Xuening Wang,Hang Lv,Mengjie Du,Yaodong Song,Jie Lian,Jian Kang,Jie Li,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TELEVAL is a dynamic benchmark for evaluating spoken language models (SLMs) in realistic Chinese conversational settings, focusing on implicit cues and user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for SLMs often misalign with natural user interactions, prompting the need for a more realistic evaluation framework.

Method: TELEVAL evaluates SLMs across three dimensions (Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, System Abilities) using dialogue formats and separate text/audio output assessments.

Result: Experiments show current SLMs still lag in natural conversational tasks, highlighting room for improvement.

Conclusion: TELEVAL aims to enhance SLM development by providing a user-centered evaluation framework.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates PEFT techniques and introduces a hybrid method combining BOFT and LoRA-GA, achieving better efficiency and generalization. It also adapts uRNN for LLMs, showing superior performance with reduced resource use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally expensive, necessitating efficient methods to reduce resource demands while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The paper evaluates PEFT techniques (LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, uRNN) and proposes a hybrid strategy integrating BOFT and LoRA-GA. It also adapts uRNN principles for LLMs.

Result: The hybrid method outperforms baselines, nearing full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing training time by 2.1x and memory usage by 50%.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is a scalable solution for fine-tuning LLMs under resource constraints, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces updated 2024 English GloVe models, addressing gaps in documentation and incorporating modern linguistic and cultural relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original 2014 GloVe models lacked detailed documentation and needed updates to reflect evolving language and usage.

Method: Two sets of word embeddings were trained using Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation included vocabulary comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks.

Result: The 2024 models include new culturally relevant words, perform similarly on structural tasks, and show improved performance on recent NER datasets, especially non-Western data.

Conclusion: The updated GloVe models provide better documentation and improved relevance for contemporary language use.

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

*Hongjie Chen,Zehan Li,Yaodong Song,Wenming Deng,Yitong Yao,Yuxin Zhang,Hang Lv,Xuechao Zhu,Jian Kang,Jie Lian,Jie Li,Chao Wang,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM is a spoken language model that incorporates paralinguistic and speaker characteristics, improving natural spoken interactions beyond text semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models overlook paralinguistic cues like emotion, dialect, and age in speech. GOAT-SLM aims to address this gap.

Method: Uses a dual-modality head architecture and modular, staged training to align linguistic and non-linguistic information.

Result: Outperforms existing models in emotion, dialect, and age-sensitive tasks on the TELEVAL benchmark.

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM advances more natural and socially aware spoken language systems by modeling beyond linguistic content.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

*Xiaoyuan Li,Moxin Li,Wenjie Wang,Rui Men,Yichang Zhang,Fuli Feng,Dayiheng Liu,Junyang Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to perform visual operations via code in multi-modal mathematical reasoning, highlighting gaps in current evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of MLLMs focus on text-only reasoning, neglecting their ability to perform accurate visual operations via code. This work addresses that gap.

Method: The framework evaluates MLLMs on Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) and Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE), using a dataset of five mathematical figure types. Nine MLLMs are tested.

Result: Results show MLLMs lag significantly behind human performance in fine-grained visual operations.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improved MLLM capabilities in visual operations via code for multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

*Gonzalo Cardenal Antolin,Jacques Fellay,Bashkim Jaha,Roger Kouyos,Niko Beerenwinkel,Diane Duroux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs in HIV management, introducing HIVMedQA as a benchmark. Gemini 2.5 Pro performed best, but proprietary models and complexity challenges highlight the need for targeted development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in clinical decision-making, but their integration into HIV care lacks exploration and benchmarking, raising concerns about accuracy and safety.

Method: The study used HIVMedQA, a curated dataset of HIV-related questions, to evaluate seven general and three specialized LLMs. Performance was assessed using lexical similarity and LLM-as-a-judge metrics.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed others, but proprietary models and complexity reduced performance. Medically fine-tuned models didn't always excel, and reasoning was harder than factual recall.

Conclusion: Targeted development and evaluation are crucial for safe, effective LLM integration in HIV clinical care.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

*Kexin Chen,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Haonan Zhang,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer-based text embedding models suffer from 'sticky tokens' that disrupt embedding reliability. The paper introduces STD to detect these tokens, identifies their origins, and highlights their negative impact on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the issue of 'sticky tokens' in Transformer-based text embedding models, which degrade embedding reliability and downstream performance.

Method: Introduces Sticky Token Detector (STD), a method for detecting sticky tokens through sentence and token filtering, and analyzes their origins and effects.

Result: Identifies 868 sticky tokens across 40 checkpoints, showing they originate from special/unused vocabulary entries or fragmented subwords. Downstream tasks suffer up to 50% performance drops.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for improved tokenization and model design to mitigate sticky tokens' impact on text embedding applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

*Wonjun Jeong,Dongseok Kim,Taegkeun Whangbo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOPE is a framework to mitigate selection bias in LLM evaluations by equalizing lucky-rates and blocking near-miss guesses, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exploit biases in option positions or labels, inflating scores without genuine understanding, necessitating a fairer evaluation method.

Method: SCOPE uses a null prompt to estimate position-bias, redistributes answer slots inversely, and prevents semantically similar distractors near answers.

Result: SCOPE outperforms existing debiasing methods, showing stable improvements and clearer confidence distributions.

Conclusion: SCOPE enhances fairness and reliability in LLM evaluations, setting a new standard.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

*Aline Belloni,Patrick Prieur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) with existing ISO9001-aligned business processes using the SECI model and PDCA cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations struggle to align ISO30401's knowledge activities with their operational processes, necessitating a clear integration method.

Method: The study uses process modeling principles from ISO9001 and applies the SECI model through PDCA cycles to implement KMS.

Result: The approach successfully demonstrates how KMS can entwine with other processes in an Integrated Management System.

Conclusion: The paper provides a practical framework for implementing ISO30401-compliant KMS within existing business processes.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTP is a defense method for RAG systems to detect and filter poisoned documents by analyzing token gradients and masking high-impact tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are vulnerable to poisoned documents that can mislead LLMs, necessitating a robust defense mechanism.

Method: GMTP identifies high-impact tokens via gradients of the retriever's similarity function, masks them, and checks their probabilities using an MLM to detect malicious documents.

Result: GMTP filters over 90% of poisoned content while preserving relevant documents, ensuring robust performance.

Conclusion: GMTP effectively mitigates adversarial attacks in RAG systems, maintaining accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning improves LLMs' ability to follow instructions but increases susceptibility to misinformation, shifting reliance from the assistant to the user role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how instruction-tuning affects LLMs' acceptance of misinformation, given its potential risks in real-world applications.

Method: Comparative analysis of instruction-tuned and base LLMs, examining factors like user role, misinformation length, and system warnings.

Result: Instruction-tuned LLMs are more likely to accept misinformation from users, showing increased reliance on user-provided information.

Conclusion: Systematic approaches are needed to mitigate the unintended consequences of instruction-tuning and improve LLM reliability.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

*Xinrui Chen,Hongxing Zhang,Fanyi Zeng,Yongxian Wei,Yizhi Wang,Xitong Ling,Guanghao Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prune&Comp is a training-free layer pruning method for LLMs that compensates for hidden state magnitude gaps, improving performance over existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer pruning in LLMs causes performance degradation due to hidden state magnitude gaps, which Prune&Comp aims to mitigate.

Method: Prune&Comp estimates and compensates for magnitude gaps by rescaling remaining weights offline, with no runtime overhead. It also uses iterative pruning.

Result: Pruning 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B with Prune&Comp halves perplexity and retains 93.19% QA performance, outperforming baselines by 4.01%.

Conclusion: Prune&Comp effectively enhances layer pruning by addressing magnitude gaps, offering a plug-and-play solution for LLM compression.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Locate-and-Focus method to improve terminology translation in speech translation by minimizing noise and better utilizing translation knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate terminology translation in speech translation is challenging due to noise and underutilized translation knowledge.

Method: The Locate-and-Focus method locates terminology clips to minimize noise and associates translation knowledge with audio and text modalities.

Result: The method enhances terminology translation success and maintains general translation performance across datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses terminology translation challenges in speech translation.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

*Nevidu Jayatilleke,Nisansa de Silva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of six OCR engines for Sinhala and Tamil, revealing Surya and Document AI as top performers, with a new synthetic Tamil dataset introduced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the OCR challenge for Low-Resourced Languages (LRLs) like Sinhala and Tamil, which lack extensive research compared to High-Resourced Languages.

Method: Evaluated six OCR engines (Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document AI, Tesseract, Subasa OCR, EasyOCR) using five measurement techniques for character and word-level accuracy.

Result: Surya performed best for Sinhala (WER 2.61%), while Document AI excelled for Tamil (CER 0.78%).

Conclusion: Surya and Document AI are top choices for Sinhala and Tamil OCR, respectively, with potential for further research using the new synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM uses LoRA to adapt LLMs to specific styles without paired data, preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise communication requires LLMs to adopt specific styles (e.g., brand voice) without losing instruction adherence, which is challenging with unstructured corpora.

Method: Train LoRA adapters on a base model with stylistic corpora, then merge with an instruction-following model.

Result: Improved stylistic consistency and preserved instruction adherence, validated by human evaluations.

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM efficiently enables stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

*Biao Yi,Zekun Fei,Jianing Geng,Tong Li,Lihai Nie,Zheli Liu,Yiming Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'overthinking backdoors' as a novel attack on Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enabling precise control over reasoning verbosity via data poisoning while preserving output correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and exploit vulnerabilities in LRMs, specifically their chain-of-thought reasoning, by introducing a stealthy, tunable backdoor attack.

Method: A data poisoning approach using tunable triggers (repetitions) paired with verbose CoT responses, generated by a teacher LLM to inject redundant refinement steps.

Result: Empirical results show reliable, controllable multi-fold increases in reasoning length without compromising answer correctness.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a new attack vector for LRMs, highlighting potential security risks in their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MT models struggle with gender inference, often relying on stereotypes. They should maintain uncertainty in ambiguous cases, but current models fail to do so consistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biased behavior in MT models when inferring gender from ambiguous contexts.

Method: Using semantic uncertainty metrics to evaluate model performance on unambiguous and ambiguous gender translation tasks.

Result: Models with high accuracy on unambiguous cases don't show proper uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Debiasing affects ambiguous and unambiguous cases differently.

Conclusion: MT models need better handling of uncertainty in gender inference, and debiasing efforts should consider both ambiguous and unambiguous cases.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

*Yifu Chen,Bingchen Huang,Zhiling Wang,Yuanchao Du,Junfeng Luo,Lei Shen,Zhineng chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TDR is a novel framework for improving in-context learning (ICL) by decoupling examples from different tasks and modeling fine-grained feedback from LLMs to enhance retrieval quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in retrieving high-quality examples for ICL, specifically cross-task data distribution and fine-grained feedback connection.

Method: Proposes TDR, which decouples ICL examples by task and uses LLM feedback to supervise retrieval training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 30 NLP tasks and is compatible with various LLMs.

Conclusion: TDR effectively improves ICL by enhancing example retrieval quality and is easily integrable.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

TL;DR: A novel framework combines human expertise and LLM assistance to improve propaganda detection on social media, addressing annotation challenges and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of propaganda detection and limited labeled data necessitate a scalable and consistent annotation approach.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical taxonomy, conducts human annotation, implements LLM-assisted pre-annotation, and fine-tunes smaller models on LLM-generated data.

Result: Significant improvements in annotation agreement and time-efficiency, with smaller models trained via knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: The framework advances scalable propaganda detection, supporting transparent media ecosystems aligned with SDG 16.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR is an interactive, open-source tool for detailed error analysis of LLMs, providing textual feedback, system-level error issues, and an interactive dashboard for comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations lack actionable insights, offering only single scores or rankings without explaining why a model performs as it does.

Method: CLEAR generates per-instance feedback, identifies system-level error issues, quantifies their prevalence, and offers an interactive dashboard for analysis.

Result: CLEAR enables detailed error analysis, demonstrated on RAG and Math benchmarks, and validated through a user case study.

Conclusion: CLEAR bridges the gap in LLM evaluation by providing actionable insights into model performance, enhancing benchmarking and error analysis.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

TL;DR: The study examines inconsistencies in Wikipedia's multilingual tabular data, proposing a method to analyze and categorize them, with implications for AI reliability and knowledge verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's independent updates across languages cause factual inconsistencies, affecting its neutrality and AI systems relying on it.

Method: Developed a methodology to collect, align, and analyze multilingual Wikipedia tables, using quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Result: Identified categories of inconsistency in tabular data, providing insights into multilingual alignment.

Conclusion: Findings impact factual verification, multilingual knowledge interaction, and AI system reliability using Wikipedia.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

TL;DR: FinDPO, a finance-specific LLM framework using Direct Preference Optimization, outperforms SFT models by 11% in sentiment analysis and integrates into portfolio strategies with strong returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online financial opinions impact markets, but SFT LLMs struggle with generalization and domain-specific nuances.

Method: FinDPO uses DPO for human preference alignment and introduces a 'logit-to-score' conversion for continuous sentiment scoring.

Result: FinDPO achieves 11% better performance than SFT models and 67% annual returns with a Sharpe ratio of 2.0.

Conclusion: FinDPO is a robust solution for financial sentiment analysis, enhancing both accuracy and practical trading performance.

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraTable is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Arabic tabular data, highlighting their limitations in complex reasoning tasks and proposing an automated evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underrepresentation of Arabic tabular data in benchmarks and the limited performance of LLMs in structured data interpretation.

Method: A hybrid pipeline: LLMs generate initial content, human experts filter and verify it to ensure quality. Tasks include question answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning.

Result: LLMs perform well on simple tasks but struggle with deeper reasoning. The automated evaluation framework matches human judge performance.

Conclusion: AraTable fills a gap in Arabic tabular data evaluation, offering a resource to improve LLM performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

TL;DR: Transformer-based model (XLM-RoBERTa-large) achieves high accuracy in restoring punctuation in Bangla text, addressing low-resource challenges with data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Punctuation restoration is crucial for readability and ASR post-processing, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla.

Method: Used XLM-RoBERTa-large model, focused on four punctuation marks, and employed data augmentation due to scarce annotated resources.

Result: Achieved 97.1% accuracy on News, 91.2% on Reference, and 90.2% on ASR sets, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes a baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and provides public datasets/code for future low-resource NLP research.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text, analyzing purpose, techniques, and evaluation methods, highlighting transformer architectures and utility-focused assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address clinical NLP challenges like sparsity and privacy by generating synthetic medical text.

Method: Systematic review of 94 articles from 1,398, focusing on purpose, techniques (e.g., transformers like GPT), and evaluation methods (similarity, privacy, structure, utility).

Result: Synthetic text aids in augmentation, assistive writing, and privacy-preserving, with moderate success in mimicking real documents. Privacy remains a concern.

Conclusion: Synthetic medical text improves NLP tasks but requires more human assessment for privacy. Advances could streamline workflows and data transfer.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning) enhances LLMs for tabular data generation by integrating sparse dependency graphs, improving focus on critical feature interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with sparse feature-level dependencies in tabular data, diluting attention on key relationships.

Method: GraDe uses a dynamic graph learning module guided by functional dependencies to prioritize critical feature interactions.

Result: GraDe outperforms LLM-based methods by up to 12% on complex datasets and matches state-of-the-art in synthetic data quality.

Conclusion: GraDe offers a practical, minimally intrusive solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMT methods struggle with rigid visual-linguistic alignment and limited domain generalization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Multi30K (English-to-French/German) and improves WMT benchmarks for image-free translation.

Conclusion: GIIFT effectively bridges modality gaps and generalizes to broader image-free domains, setting a new standard in MMT.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional k-mer tokenization struggles with uneven token distribution and limited global context understanding, prompting the need for a hybrid approach.

Method: Merge 6-mer tokens with BPE-600 tokens to create a balanced, context-aware vocabulary for DLMs.

Result: The model achieved accuracies of 10.78% (3-mers), 10.1% (4-mers), and 4.12% (5-mers), surpassing models like NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy enhances DNA modeling by capturing local and global patterns, advancing genomic language modeling for future biological research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

TL;DR: WINO is a training-free decoding algorithm for DLLMs that improves the quality-speed trade-off by enabling revokable decoding through a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLLMs suffer from a severe quality-speed trade-off due to irreversible standard decoding, leading to performance degradation.

Method: WINO uses a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism to aggressively draft tokens and verify them using bidirectional context, allowing refinement of suspicious tokens.

Result: WINO accelerates inference by 6× on GSM8K with 2.58% higher accuracy and achieves a 10× speedup on Flickr30K with improved performance.

Conclusion: WINO decisively improves the quality-speed trade-off in DLLMs, demonstrating superiority in speed and accuracy across benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

TL;DR: AQuilt is a framework for creating instruction-tuning data from unlabeled data in specialized domains, improving LLM performance with logic and inspection. It reduces costs and enhances task relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in specialized domains, and existing data synthesis methods are costly or limited in generalization.

Method: AQuilt constructs instruction-tuning data using unlabeled data, incorporating logic, inspection, and customizable task instructions.

Result: AQuilt matches DeepSeek-V3's performance at 17% cost and generates more task-relevant data.

Conclusion: AQuilt offers a cost-effective, high-quality solution for domain-specific LLM tuning.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRPrompt unifies textual feedback and numerical rewards for prompt optimization, achieving state-of-the-art results on GSMHard and MATH datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between heuristic-based and reward-trained prompt optimization methods by incorporating textual feedback directly into training.

Method: Introduces the Textual Reward Prompt (TRPrompt) framework, which iteratively improves prompts using textual feedback without prior dataset collection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GSMHard and MATH datasets by generating query-specific prompts.

Conclusion: TRPrompt effectively combines textual feedback and training, demonstrating superior prompt optimization for LLMs.

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning methods for adapting language models rely on fixed criteria, limiting their effectiveness. The goal is to broaden the impact of reinforcement learning by using instruction-specific criteria.

Method: Proposes RLCF, where checklists are extracted from instructions, and responses are evaluated using AI judges and verifier programs to compute rewards for reinforcement learning.

Result: RLCF improves performance on all five benchmarks tested, including significant boosts in hard satisfaction rate, InFoBench, and win rate on Arena-Hard.

Conclusion: Checklist feedback is a key tool for enhancing language models' ability to support diverse queries, demonstrating RLCF's superiority over existing alignment methods.

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that
express a multitude of needs.

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRC is a QAT framework for edge devices that uses coreset selection and cascaded layer correction to reduce quantization errors, improving accuracy with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient low-bit quantized models on edge devices, coupled with privacy concerns, drives the development of a solution that minimizes computational costs while maintaining performance.

Method: QuaRC employs coreset selection using Relative Entropy Score and Cascaded Layer Correction to align quantized and full-precision model outputs.

Result: QuaRC improves Top-1 accuracy by 5.72% on ResNet-18 (2-bit) with 1% data subset on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: QuaRC effectively addresses quantization errors in small datasets, enhancing performance for edge device deployment.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A low-complexity AI model using causality-invariant learning improves semantic communication by extracting causal and non-causal representations for robust data reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance data reconstruction in semantic communication by leveraging invariant knowledge across diverse domains and minimizing communication overhead.

Method: Proposes a generative adversarial network with causality-invariant learning to extract causal (invariant) and non-causal representations, along with sparse update protocols.

Result: Ensures consistency across devices, improves classification performance, and achieves superior PSNR in data reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The model effectively captures invariant knowledge, enhancing semantic communication reliability and performance.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of quantitative analysis on how self-similarity in hidden space geometry influences weight optimization and neuron dynamics in deep neural networks.

Method: A complex network modeling method based on hidden-layer neuron output features to study self-similarity and its impact on classification performance.

Result: Self-similarity varies by architecture; embedding constraints during training improves performance by up to 6% in MLP and attention architectures.

Conclusion: Adjusting self-similarity in feature networks can enhance deep neural network performance, with architecture-specific effects.

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based adaptive optimization algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization, focusing on dimensionality reduction and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize computational effort and interpret optimization results for understanding extrema in achieving desired flow-fields.

Method: Uses a surrogate-based, actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach with temporal parameter freezing. Local optimized parameter changes around CFD simulations act as ground truth.

Result: Speeds up global optimization if local parameter neighborhoods are large and reward/cost estimates are accurate. Demonstrated on a fluid-dynamical problem with feature importance scoring.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances computational efficiency and interpretability in aerodynamic shape optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

*Neil He,Hiren Madhu,Ngoc Bui,Menglin Yang,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of Euclidean geometry in foundation models and proposes hyperbolic spaces as a better alternative for representing hierarchical data and improving reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like LLMs and VLMs face limitations in representational capacity, adaptability, and scalability. The paper questions if Euclidean geometry is optimal and explores hyperbolic spaces as a solution.

Method: The paper reviews hyperbolic neural networks and their application in enhancing foundation models, focusing on their mathematical properties for hierarchical data embedding.

Result: Hyperbolic spaces improve reasoning, zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal alignment in foundation models while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the potential of hyperbolic spaces for foundation models and outlines future research directions to address challenges in the field.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

### [167] [Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17788)
*Ali Vardasbi,Gustavo Penha,Claudia Hauff,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses position bias and low repetition consistency in LLMs when ranking or evaluating items, proposing a dynamic early-stopping method to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit position bias and inconsistency in rankings, requiring costly repetition strategies. The variability in bias direction and magnitude per instance necessitates a tailored mitigation approach.

Method: Introduces a dynamic early-stopping method to adaptively determine repetitions per instance, with a confidence-based variant further reducing calls.

Result: Dynamic repetition reduces LLM calls by 81% (87% with confidence adaptation) while preserving accuracy, tested across three LLMs and two tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently mitigates position bias and inconsistency, significantly lowering computational costs with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CICME is a three-step method for inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data across domains, using Causal Transfer Learning to identify domain-invariant mechanisms and guide individual domain estimations. It outperforms baselines in linear Gaussian models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand complex sensor systems through causality by addressing the challenge of inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous multi-domain data.

Method: CICME uses Causal Transfer Learning (CTL) to detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms and then estimates individual domain mechanisms. Evaluated on linear Gaussian models in manufacturing-inspired scenarios.

Result: CICME outperforms baseline methods by leveraging pooled and individual domain data, showing reliable detection of common causal mechanisms.

Conclusion: CICME effectively combines causal discovery on pooled and individual domain data, demonstrating superior performance in certain scenarios.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Tong Li,Zhu Xiao,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model (LSDM) for accurate service-level mobile traffic prediction, addressing adaptability and uncertainty challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack adaptability across urban environments and produce inaccurate results due to high uncertainty in personal traffic patterns and lack of environmental context.

Method: LSDM combines diffusion models' generative power with transformers' adaptive learning, enhanced by LLMs for contextual understanding.

Result: LSDM outperforms in traffic prediction, improving performance by 2.83% (R²) and reducing RMSE by 8.29% compared to similar models like CSDI.

Conclusion: LSDM effectively addresses service-level traffic prediction challenges, demonstrating superior generalization and adaptability.

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multivariate time-series analysis, such as accurate predictions and anomaly detection, using advanced statistical and AI techniques.

Method: Leverages diffusion-based modeling for dependencies, conformal prediction for calibration, and copula-based modeling with dimensionality reduction for anomaly detection.

Result: Effective in forecasting and identifying anomalies in real operational data from water systems.

Conclusion: CoCAI provides statistically valid, actionable results with minimal deployment overhead.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenSelect leverages LLMs' reasoning to select the best solution among candidates, outperforming pointwise and pairwise methods in math tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities or scale poorly with larger budgets.

Method: GenSelect uses long reasoning to select the best solution from N candidates, scaling efficiently with parallel sampling.

Result: GenSelect outperforms existing scoring methods in math reasoning tasks with simple prompting.

Conclusion: GenSelect effectively combines LLMs' comparative strengths with scalable parallel sampling for improved reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

*Kenta Shiraishi,Yuka Muto,Atsushi Okazaki,Shunji Kotsuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using WGAN for high-resolution precipitation downscaling, achieving visually realistic results despite slightly lower conventional metric performance. The critic score correlates with human perception and helps identify unrealistic outputs or data artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution precipitation prediction is critical for mitigating damage from localized heavy rainfall, but traditional methods struggle with accuracy.

Method: The study employs Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with optimal transport cost for precipitation downscaling, comparing it to conventional neural networks.

Result: WGAN produces visually realistic precipitation fields with fine-scale structures, though slightly underperforming on standard metrics. The critic score aligns with human perception and detects anomalies.

Conclusion: WGAN enhances perceptual realism in precipitation downscaling and provides a novel approach for evaluating and quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

TL;DR: GraphEXT is a novel explainability framework for GNNs that uses cooperative game theory and social externalities to quantify node importance by analyzing interactions and structural changes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'black-box' nature of GNNs and the lack of effective methods to capture node interactions drive the need for an explainability framework like GraphEXT.

Method: GraphEXT partitions nodes into coalitions, decomposes the graph into subgraphs, and uses the Shapley value under externalities to measure node importance based on structural changes and interactions.

Result: GraphEXT outperforms baseline methods in fidelity across various GNN architectures, enhancing model explainability.

Conclusion: GraphEXT successfully addresses GNN explainability by focusing on node interactions and structural impacts, proving its effectiveness in experiments.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

TL;DR: Molecular task arithmetic trains models on negative examples to generate positive molecules without labeled data, outperforming traditional methods in diversity and success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of positive molecules in generative design by leveraging abundant negative examples.

Method: Training on negative examples to learn property directions, then moving models in opposite directions to generate positive molecules.

Result: Outperforms models trained on positive molecules in diversity and success, especially in zero-shot, dual-objective, and few-shot tasks.

Conclusion: Molecular task arithmetic is a simple, data-efficient, and effective transfer learning strategy for molecule design.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning dynamics in stochastic systems, especially with non-periodic inputs, where standard architectures like FNO fall short.

Method: Extends FNO with mirror padding to handle non-periodic inputs, leveraging Wong--Zakai theorems and approximation techniques for theoretical guarantees.

Result: MFNO approximates stochastic differential equations accurately, shows strong resolution generalization, and outperforms baselines in speed and performance.

Conclusion: MFNO is a robust and efficient solution for stochastic systems, offering theoretical guarantees and empirical superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

*Amrith Setlur,Pratiksha Thaker,Jonathan Ullman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends lower bounds for public-private learning to cases with significant distribution shift, showing public data's limited benefit under large shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complementary value of public and private data in machine learning when distribution shifts exist.

Method: Extends known lower bounds to settings with distribution shift, analyzing Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Result: Small shifts require abundant public or private data; large shifts render public data useless.

Conclusion: Public data's utility depends on the magnitude of distribution shift relative to desired accuracy.

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical ML in robotic manipulation, the paper motivates the use of FL for distributed training without compromising data privacy, especially in cloud-edge computing environments.

Method: The paper introduces FL concepts and their application to cloud robotic manipulation, proposing centralized or decentralized FL model designs for verification.

Result: FL is shown to offer significant advantages for cloud robotic manipulation, though challenges in scalability and reliability remain.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by emphasizing FL's potential in cloud robotics while calling for further research to tackle its challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the inverse design of porous metamaterials with specific hydraulic properties (e.g., porosity, permeability) using a computationally efficient deep learning approach.

Method: Developed a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE) augmented with a regressor, trained on synthetic and real porous microstructure datasets. Used LBM for permeability data and CNN for property prediction.

Result: The pVAE successfully generated metamaterials with desired properties, mapped microstructural features into an interpretable latent space, and reduced computational costs compared to direct simulations.

Conclusion: The framework enables efficient inverse design of porous metamaterials, with open-access datasets and codes provided for further research.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Motivation: To formally explain the origin of heavy-tailed power-law metrics (alpha, alpha-hat) in HTSR and predict NN performance without training/testing data.

Method: Uses statistical mechanics, random matrix theory, and quantum chemistry to derive SETOL, introducing ERG as a new metric. Validated on a 3-layer MLP and SOTA NNs.

Result: SETOL aligns well with HTSR metrics, showing excellent agreement in predicting layer quality for both MLPs and SOTA NNs.

Conclusion: SETOL provides a robust theoretical framework for understanding NN performance, with practical applications in estimating layer quality.

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

*Jessica Quaye,Charvi Rastogi,Alicia Parrish,Oana Inel,Minsuk Kahng,Lora Aroyo,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seed2Harvest combines human creativity and machine scalability to generate diverse adversarial prompts for robust T2I model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial prompt datasets are either limited in size (human-crafted) or lack realism (synthetic). A hybrid approach is needed for comprehensive testing.

Method: Proposes Seed2Harvest, a hybrid red-teaming method that expands human-crafted adversarial prompts while preserving their characteristics.

Result: Achieves higher diversity (535 locations, 7.48 entropy) and maintains attack success rates (0.31-0.36).

Conclusion: Human-machine collaboration is key for scalable, realistic adversarial testing of T2I models.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

*Hongrong Yang,Markus Schlaepfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanPulse is a scalable deep learning framework for ultra-fine-grained city-wide OD flow predictions, addressing limitations of traditional and deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for population flow prediction face limitations like static spatial assumptions, poor cross-city generalization, high computational costs, and low resolution.

Method: UrbanPulse treats each POI as a node, combining a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder. It uses a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluated on 103 million GPS records from California, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse advances high-resolution urban forecasting, making it deployable across diverse cities through efficient transfer learning.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MFTRR, a framework for post-quality assessment using multimodal data and relational reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to leverage multimodal cues, introduce noise, and lack semantic relationship capture, limiting post-quality assessment.

Method: MFTRR reframes the task as ranking, using two modules: Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning and Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning.

Result: MFTRR achieves up to 9.52% NDCG@3 improvement over unimodal methods on the Art History dataset.

Conclusion: MFTRR effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, enhancing post-quality assessment through multimodal and relational reasoning.

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

Conclusion: VIBE demonstrates strong performance in fMRI activity prediction by effectively fusing multi-modal features and leveraging Transformer architectures.

Abstract: We present VIBE, a two-stage Transformer that fuses multi-modal video, audio,

obtained 0.3198 and 0.2096, respectively, winning Phase-1 and placing second
overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves the GeoAggregator (GA) model for geospatial tabular data by optimizing its pipeline for efficiency and adding explainability features, demonstrating better accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing the GeoAggregator model's computational efficiency and explainability for better understanding of geospatial phenomena.

Method: 1) Optimized pipeline for faster dataloading and streamlined forward pass; 2) Model ensembling and GeoShapley-based explanation function.

Result: Improved prediction accuracy, faster inference speed, and effective capture of spatial effects in synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced GA model offers better performance and explainability, with the pipeline made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

### [186] [SIFOTL: A Principled, Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17979)
*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIFOTL is a privacy-conscious method for identifying data shifts in tabular datasets, outperforming baselines with high F1 scores even under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy rules and noise complicate analysis of tabular datasets, especially in healthcare. Existing methods either ignore noise or require full data access.

Method: SIFOTL uses privacy-compliant summary statistics, twin XGBoost models with LLM assistance, and a Pareto-weighted decision tree to identify interpretable segments.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 0.85 on MEPS data and 0.86-0.96 on EHR datasets, outperforming baselines (F1=0.19-0.67). Robust to noise (F1 >= 0.75).

Conclusion: SIFOTL offers an interpretable, privacy-safe, and noise-robust solution for analyzing data shifts in tabular datasets.

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

TL;DR: A novel learning paradigm, Machine Unlearning TSEP, is introduced to allow trained traffic state estimation and prediction models to selectively forget sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data, addressing privacy and trust issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness concerns in data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) threaten public trust. Regulations like the 'right to be forgotten' necessitate solutions beyond simple data removal.

Method: The study proposes Machine Unlearning TSEP, a learning paradigm enabling models to selectively forget unwanted data.

Result: The approach enhances the trustworthiness and reliability of TSEP models by addressing privacy and data integrity issues.

Conclusion: Machine Unlearning TSEP offers a promising solution to privacy and trust challenges in intelligent transportation systems.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO is computationally expensive, prompting the need for a resource-efficient method.

Method: Proposes a predictive framework modeling training dynamics, tested on Llama and Qwen models (3B, 8B), deriving empirical scaling laws.

Result: Identifies three training phases (slow start, rapid improvement, plateau) and shows early stopping reduces compute without performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes across models, offering a practical guide for efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using neural operators is introduced for solving PDEs and downscaling ocean current data to arbitrary resolutions, validated on real-world and synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution current data is crucial for oceanography but existing satellite products and models lack the necessary spatial granularity for local analyses.

Method: A supervised deep learning framework based on neural operators is proposed to solve PDEs and downscale data, applicable to arbitrary resolutions.

Result: The model was evaluated on Copernicus ocean current data and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulations, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the resolution limitations of current data, offering a scalable solution for detailed local analyses.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

Motivation: To improve training efficiency and stability in reinforcement learning for large language models, addressing limitations of token-level methods.

Method: Defines importance ratio based on sequence likelihood, performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization.

Result: Outperforms GRPO, stabilizes MoE RL training, and simplifies RL infrastructure design.

Conclusion: GSPO enhances training and performance, contributing to improvements in Qwen3 models.

Abstract: This paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), our stable,

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

*Ryusei Fujimoto,Yugo Nakamura,Yutaka Arakawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-AAE combines an Anonymizing AutoEncoder (AAE) with ADPCM to protect user privacy in wearable sensor data while maintaining activity recognition accuracy and reducing data volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy protection is crucial in healthcare applications using wearable sensors, as these devices can inadvertently reveal user identities through behavioral signatures.

Method: C-AAE integrates an AAE to suppress identity cues in sensor data and ADPCM to further anonymize and compress the data.

Result: C-AAE reduces user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15% compared to AAE alone, maintains activity recognition accuracy within 5% of baseline, and cuts data volume by ~75%.

Conclusion: C-AAE effectively balances privacy and utility in sensor-based healthcare applications.

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision PTQ framework that reduces LLM weights by 10x, achieving 1.6 bits per weight with innovations like PBAR and FIAS, improving accuracy in low-bit settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to high computational costs and massive parameters. Ultra low-bit quantization often degrades performance, necessitating a solution for efficient compression without significant accuracy loss.

Method: Squeeze10-LLM uses a staged mixed-precision PTQ framework, quantizing 80% of weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. It introduces PBAR for refined weight significance and FIAS to preserve activation information.

Result: Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2 show Squeeze10-LLM improves average accuracy from 43% to 56% on zero-shot tasks, outperforming existing PTQ methods.

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit quantization, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

*Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework to analyze how additional supervision (beyond hard labels) improves classification accuracy, showing that distributional information of non-hard-labeled classes is key, and experimentally validates the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited training data and the need for high-accuracy models motivate the study of additional supervision (e.g., label confidences) to enrich label information.

Method: A theoretical framework treats hard labels and additional supervision as distributions, combining them into soft labels via affine combinations. Analysis focuses on the role of non-hard-labeled class distributions and mixing coefficients.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows that additional supervision's distributional information and mixing coefficients refine soft labels, improving generalization error bounds. Experiments confirm improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Additional supervision, especially distributional information of non-hard-labeled classes, enhances model performance. The framework provides insights for designing effective supervision in data-scarce settings.

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes PDA-DRL, a deep reinforcement learning method for RAN slicing in O-RAN, reducing average delay by 38% and introducing a reward-based personalization technique for MVNOs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of RAN slicing in O-RAN with multiple MVNOs competing for PRBs while meeting probabilistic delay constraints.

Method: Derived a reward function using LLN, adapted it for real-world use, and developed PDA-DRL, a percentile-based delay-aware DRL solution. Also introduced a reward-based personalization method for model weight sharing.

Result: PDA-DRL outperformed baselines with a 38% reduction in average delay. The personalization method surpassed traditional aggregation techniques.

Conclusion: PDA-DRL and the reward-based personalization method effectively address RAN slicing challenges, offering superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adversarial attack method for RL systems using LLMs to generate tailored adversarial rewards and a critical state identification algorithm, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks on RL systems are challenging; current methods modify environments or policies, limiting practicality. This work aims to mislead RL agents without altering the environment.

Method: Proposes a reward iteration optimization framework using LLMs to craft adversarial rewards and a critical state identification algorithm to target vulnerable states.

Result: Experiments show the method's superiority in inducing suboptimal decisions in diverse environments.

Conclusion: The approach effectively misleads RL agents without environment modification, enhancing adversarial attack practicality.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing

### [196] [Maximizing Prefix-Confidence at Test-Time Efficiently Improves Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18122)
*Matthias Otth,Jonas Hübotter,Ido Hakimi,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models self-improve using their own confidence for mathematical reasoning, outperforming majority voting and avoiding length biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore test-time scaling of language models for math tasks using the model's confidence, without external signals.

Method: Uses prefix-confidence to select the most promising attempts, evaluated on five datasets with varying difficulty levels.

Result: Prefix-confidence scaling (32 tokens) outperforms majority voting in accuracy-compute trade-off and avoids length biases. Test-time training with prefix-confidence doesn't surpass prefix-confidence scaling.

Conclusion: Prefix-confidence scaling is effective for mathematical reasoning, offering better performance and efficiency than existing methods.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

### [198] [When Noisy Labels Meet Class Imbalance on Graphs: A Graph Augmentation Method with LLM and Pseudo Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18153)
*Riting Xia,Rucong Wang,Yulin Liu,Anchen Li,Xueyan Liu,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphALP is a novel framework using LLMs and pseudo-labeling to address class-imbalanced graph node classification with noisy labels, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs often have noisy labels and class imbalance, which existing methods overlook by assuming clean labels.

Method: GraphALP combines LLM-based oversampling for minority nodes, dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling, and secondary LLM-guided oversampling.

Result: GraphALP achieves superior performance on class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively tackles class imbalance and label noise in graph node classification.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

### [199] [ChronoSelect: Robust Learning with Noisy Labels via Dynamics Temporal Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18183)
*Jianchao Wang,Qingfeng Li,Pengcheng Zheng,Xiaorong Pu,Yazhou Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChronoSelect is a novel framework for learning with noisy labels, leveraging temporal dynamics and a four-stage memory architecture to improve generalization by partitioning samples into clean, boundary, and noisy subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning with noisy labels suffer from static evaluations and fail to utilize temporal learning dynamics, leading to degraded performance.

Method: ChronoSelect introduces a four-stage memory architecture with a sliding update mechanism and controlled decay, enabling temporal trajectory analysis and dual-branch consistency for sample partitioning.

Result: Theoretical guarantees confirm convergence and stability, and experiments show state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChronoSelect effectively addresses noisy label challenges by dynamically leveraging temporal learning patterns, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

*Daniel Grimm,Ahmed Abouelazm,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new GNN-based method improves generalization for autonomous driving by using a heterogeneous graph of traffic participants and road networks to classify trajectory goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models struggle with generalization to unseen areas, leading to performance drops.

Method: Introduces a GNN with a heterogeneous graph (traffic participants + road network) and a multi-staged goal classification approach.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness via cross-dataset evaluation (Argoverse2 to NuScenes).

Conclusion: The goal selection process enhances generalization in unseen scenarios.

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

### [201] [FedSA-GCL: A Semi-Asynchronous Federated Graph Learning Framework with Personalized Aggregation and Cluster-Aware Broadcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18219)
*Zhongzheng Yuan,Lianshuai Guo,Xunkai Li,Yinlin Zhu,Wenyu Wang,Meixia Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSA-GCL is a semi-asynchronous federated framework for graph learning, addressing inefficiencies of synchronous methods and limitations of AFL by leveraging graph topology and label divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL methods rely on synchronous communication, which is inefficient, while AFL methods ignore graph topology, risking semantic drift.

Method: Proposes FedSA-GCL with a ClusterCast mechanism, combining inter-client label divergence and graph topology for efficient training.

Result: Outperforms 9 baselines by 2.92% (Louvain) and 3.4% (Metis) in robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL effectively addresses inefficiencies and inconsistencies in FGL, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

*Ansei Yonezawa,Heisei Yonezawa,Shuichi Yahagi,Itsuro Kajiwara,Shinya Kijimoto,Hikaru Taniuchi,Kentaro Murakami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINDy-LOM combines sparse regression with library optimization to improve dynamical system modeling by optimizing basis functions for long-term prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SINDy struggles with library design for complex systems, requiring manual effort and lacking long-term prediction reliability.

Method: SINDy-LOM uses a two-layer optimization: inner-layer for sparse regression and outer-layer for optimizing parametrized basis functions based on recursive long-term prediction accuracy.

Result: The approach yields interpretable, parsimonious models, reduces user burden, and improves reliability over traditional SINDy.

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM is validated on a diesel engine airpath system, demonstrating effectiveness for complex industrial applications.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of totally corrective boosting methods based on linear programming, which have been theoretically appealing but understudied.

Method: Experimental study of six LP-based boosting formulations across 20 datasets, using heuristic and optimal base learners, analyzing accuracy, sparsity, margins, anytime performance, and hyperparameter sensitivity.

Result: Totally corrective methods outperform or match XGBoost/LightGBM with shallow trees, yield sparser ensembles, and can thin pre-trained ensembles without performance loss.

Conclusion: LP-based boosting methods are effective, especially with shallow trees, but have limitations when using optimal decision trees.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SiamSA-PPM is a self-supervised learning framework combining Siamese learning and Statistical Augmentation to enhance Predictive Process Monitoring by generating realistic trace variants and improving data variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning PPM approaches are limited by low variability and small size of real-world event logs.

Method: Uses three statistically grounded transformation methods for trace augmentation and Siamese learning for generalizable prefix representations.

Result: Outperforms SOTA in next activity and final outcome prediction, with statistical augmentation proving superior to random transformations.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM is a promising approach for data enrichment in process prediction, improving performance and variability.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An algorithm for coarsening unstructured grids using differentiable physics, k-means clustering, autodifferentiation, and stochastic minimization, reducing grid points by up to 10x while maintaining accuracy for PDEs like fluid flow and wave equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational load in numerical simulations necessitates methods to reduce problem size without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Uses k-means clustering, autodifferentiation, and stochastic minimization to coarsen unstructured grids.

Result: Achieves up to 10x reduction in grid points while preserving dynamics in key areas for linear parabolic and wave equations.

Conclusion: The approach is versatile and applicable to systems described by evolutionary PDEs.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

*Daniele Ghiani,Daniele Angioni,Giorgio Piras,Angelo Sotgiu,Luca Minnei,Srishti Gupta,Maura Pintor,Fabio Roli,Battista Biggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses security regression in continual learning (CL)-based malware detectors, proposing a regression-aware penalty to mitigate harmful prediction changes while maintaining detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware evolves rapidly, making full retraining impractical. CL is scalable but risks security regression, where previously detected malware evades detection after updates, undermining trust.

Method: The authors formalize and quantify security regression, adapting Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to CL to preserve prior predictive behavior model-agnostically.

Result: Experiments on ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show the method reduces regression across CL scenarios while maintaining detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed regression-aware penalty effectively mitigates security regression in CL-based malware detectors, ensuring reliable updates without compromising detection.

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

*Janak M. Patel,Milad Ramezankhani,Anirudh Deodhar,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel architecture, TIDSIT, is proposed for accurate battery health monitoring using irregular time-series data, outperforming existing models with a 50% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery health monitoring is critical for safety and efficiency, but existing models struggle with irregularities in real-world discharge cycle data.

Method: TIDSIT uses continuous time embeddings and temporal attention mechanisms to handle irregular and variable-length discharge cycle data without information loss.

Result: TIDSIT achieves over 50% reduction in prediction error and maintains SoH prediction error below 0.58% on the NASA dataset.

Conclusion: TIDSIT is effective, generalizable, and promising for broader health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series data.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

*Kale-ab Abebe Tessera,Leonard Hinckeldey,Riccardo Zamboni,David Abel,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current MARL methods rely on simple conventions rather than effective Markov signal recovery, leading to brittle policies. Task design flaws, not model limitations, are the issue. New environments should enforce observation-based behaviors and memory reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between empirical success and theoretical assumptions in MARL, highlighting the need for better benchmark designs.

Method: Analyzed MARL algorithms through a case study, comparing co-adapting agents with non-adaptive ones.

Result: Found that brittle conventions fail with non-adaptive agents, but models can learn grounded policies when tasks require it.

Conclusion: Advocates for new MARL environments emphasizing observation-based behaviors and memory reasoning to test core Dec-POMDP assumptions.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets reduce HyperDeepONets' complexity using low-rank adaptation, achieving fewer parameters and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory and computational costs of HyperDeepONets while maintaining or improving expressivity.

Method: Introduces PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets, leveraging low-rank adaptation to decompose the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into smaller low-rank matrices.

Result: Achieves up to 70% parameter reduction and consistently outperforms regular HyperDeepONets in predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets offer a more efficient and effective alternative for operator learning in physics-informed settings.

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for efficient uncertainty estimation in LLMs by distilling uncertainty-aware teacher models into compact student models using LoRA, achieving comparable performance with a single forward pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs struggle with accurate uncertainty quantification, and existing methods like Bayesian and ensemble-based approaches are computationally expensive.

Method: Distill uncertainty-aware teacher models into student models using LoRA, comparing softmax-based and Dirichlet-distributed outputs for uncertainty modeling.

Result: Student models achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty performance to teachers, requiring only one forward pass.

Conclusion: Evidential distillation enables robust and immediate uncertainty quantification in LLMs, a novel and efficient solution.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

### [212] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HYPER combines multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing for efficient, accurate flood prediction, especially in data-scarce regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate flood prediction and water management in regions with limited river discharge observations.

Method: Uses Bayesian model averaging (BMA) on 43 uncalibrated hydrological models, then corrects errors with reservoir computing (RC) via linear regression. Weights for ungauged basins are inferred from gauged basins.

Result: HYPER matches LSTM performance in data-rich scenarios (KGE 0.56 vs. 0.55) with 95% less computational time. In data-scarce scenarios, HYPER outperforms LSTM (KGE 0.55 vs. -0.04).

Conclusion: HYPER offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins.

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

### [213] [Revisiting Bisimulation Metric for Robust Representations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18519)
*Leiji Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Xin Li,Yao-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies flaws in the conventional bisimulation metric, proposes a revised version with adaptive coefficients, and validates its effectiveness through theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional bisimulation metric fails to represent certain scenarios and relies on fixed weights, limiting its adaptability.

Method: Introduces a revised bisimulation metric with a precise reward gap definition and adaptive update operators.

Result: Theoretical convergence guarantees and improved distinctiveness are proven, with experimental validation on DeepMind Control and Meta-World benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed metric addresses the limitations of the conventional approach, offering better adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLANCE enhances GNNs for heterophilous graphs by integrating logic-guided reasoning, dynamic refinement, and clustering, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with heterophilous graphs due to indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and lack of higher-order structural patterns.

Method: GLANCE combines logic layers, multi-head attention-based edge pruning, and clustering mechanisms.

Result: GLANCE performs competitively on benchmark datasets (Cornell, Texas, Wisconsin) and is lightweight and adaptable.

Conclusion: GLANCE provides robust, interpretable solutions for heterophilous graphs, addressing key GNN limitations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

*Magnus Bengtsson,Kenneth Östberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C2G-KD is a data-free knowledge distillation method using a class-conditional generator guided by a teacher model and PCA-derived constraints, requiring minimal real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable knowledge distillation without access to real training data, leveraging synthetic samples generated under geometric and semantic constraints.

Method: Trains a generator using a frozen teacher model and PCA-derived geometric constraints, with losses ensuring semantic and structural alignment.

Result: Effective synthetic training pipelines are created, even with as few as two real examples per class, as demonstrated on MNIST.

Conclusion: Minimal class structure suffices for generating useful synthetic samples, enabling data-free knowledge distillation.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [216] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal FMB law (force-metric-bias) using the Price equation, unifying diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection under a common mathematical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal the shared mathematical structure across seemingly different learning and optimization processes, enabling a unified understanding and design of algorithms.

Method: The Price equation partitions change into force, metric, bias, and noise components, forming the FMB law. This framework is applied to analyze various algorithms.

Result: The FMB law unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, and others, showing they are special cases of the same process.

Conclusion: The FMB law provides a foundational framework for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

### [217] [The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553)
*Jiale Chen,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPTQ, a method for quantizing LLM weights, is mathematically equivalent to Babai's nearest plane algorithm, providing geometric insights and error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical foundations of GPTQ and improve quantization methods for large language models.

Method: Show equivalence between GPTQ and Babai's algorithm for solving the closest vector problem on a lattice.

Result: GPTQ gains a geometric interpretation and inherits error bounds from Babai's algorithm.

Conclusion: This theoretical grounding enables future advancements in quantization by leveraging lattice algorithm progress.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Motivation: To understand the connection between Fisher information matrices and NTK in 2-layer ReLU networks, and to derive spectral properties and functional approximations.

Method: Analyzes the linear transformation between Fisher information matrices and NTK, performs spectral decomposition of NTK, and derives eigenfunctions with major eigenvalues.

Result: Concrete forms of eigenfunctions for NTK with major eigenvalues are presented, along with an approximation formula for functions represented by 2-layer networks.

Conclusion: The study clarifies the relationship between Fisher information matrices and NTK, offering insights into spectral properties and functional approximations in 2-layer ReLU networks.

Abstract: Fisher information matrices and neural tangent kernels (NTK) for 2-layer ReLU

### [219] [Beyond Internal Data: Constructing Complete Datasets for Fairness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18561)
*Varsha Ramineni,Hossein A. Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of fairness testing in AI when demographic data is inaccessible by proposing synthetic data construction from overlapping datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for fairness testing in AI is urgent due to regulations, but legal and privacy concerns limit access to demographic data, making it hard to assess biases.

Method: The authors propose using separate overlapping datasets to create synthetic data with demographics, validating its fidelity by comparing it to real data.

Result: Fairness metrics from synthetic data align with those from real data, proving its reliability for fairness testing.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers a practical solution for fairness testing when real data is scarce, enabling independent and model-agnostic evaluations.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

*Ethan Pronovost,Neha Boloor,Peter Schleede,Noureldin Hendy,Andres Morales,Nicholas Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an SE(2) invariant transformer for spatial data in autonomous driving, reducing memory usage from quadratic to linear while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial data processing is crucial for autonomous driving tasks, but existing SE(2) invariant methods require quadratic memory, which is inefficient.

Method: Introduces an SE(2) invariant scaled dot-product attention mechanism that scales linearly with the number of objects.

Result: The proposed transformer architecture is practical and outperforms non-invariant methods.

Conclusion: The SE(2) invariant transformer offers efficient and effective spatial data processing for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

*Zinan Ling,Yi Shi,Da Yan,Yang Zhou,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-level conditional diffusion model integrates sequence and structure data for functional protein design, introducing a new evaluation metric, Protein-MMD, to assess quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable generation of functional proteins using conditional diffusion models remains a challenge, especially with multi-level structural dependencies.

Method: Proposes a multi-level conditional diffusion model combining sequence and structure data, alongside the Protein-MMD metric for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy in conditional protein generation tasks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework and metric improve protein design by capturing hierarchical relations and ensuring functional consistency.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Moving Out,' a benchmark for human-AI collaboration in physical environments, and proposes BASS, a method to improve agent adaptability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of continuous state-action spaces and physical constraints in human-AI collaboration, ensuring effective teamwork in dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection) to enhance agent diversity and action outcome understanding. Evaluated using the Moving Out benchmark with human-human interaction data.

Result: BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in both AI-AI and human-AI collaboration tasks.

Conclusion: The Moving Out benchmark and BASS method advance human-AI collaboration in physically constrained environments, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

Motivation: To address discrepancies in theoretical and experimental results for the deuterium Hugoniot curve in the warm dense matter region.

Method: Uses three deep generative models: a normalizing flow for nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for excited-state electrons, and a permutational equivariant flow for Hartree-Fock electrons. Joint optimization minimizes variational free energy.

Result: Provides the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen, serving as a benchmark for deuterium in warm dense matter.

Conclusion: The framework successfully resolves discrepancies and offers reliable thermodynamic data for dense hydrogen.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the

TL;DR: The paper highlights a conflict between RL agents and economic equilibrium theory, showing RL agents manipulate markets. It proposes a Mean-Field RL framework to align agent behavior with competitive equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the discrepancy between RL agents' manipulative behavior and economic equilibrium assumptions.

Method: Proposes a calibrated Mean-Field RL framework with a representative agent and adjusted cost functions.

Result: The framework converges to a self-consistent fixed point aligning with competitive equilibrium.

Conclusion: Provides a tractable method for modeling learning agents in economic systems, advancing computational social science.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supporting students in overcoming cognitive biases like premature closure and heuristic reliance in diagnostic reasoning.

Method: Between-groups design in PharmaSim, an online SBL environment, comparing I-PS and PS-I sequences.

Result: Both sequences help, but PS-I significantly improves performance in transfer tasks.

Conclusion: PS-I is more effective for enhancing transfer of diagnostic reasoning skills in pharmacy education.

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key
challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability of AD is hindered by diverse vehicle types, sensors, environments, and socio-political factors like regulations and ethics. A flexible, data-driven approach is needed.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning process: 1) Environment-specific adaptation via a country-specific reward model, and 2) Vehicle-specific transfer learning for system adaptation and validation.

Result: The concept integrates technological and socio-political aspects, facilitating scalable AD across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical differences.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables effective scalability of AD by addressing both technical and contextual challenges.

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.

### [229] [Towards Robust Foundation Models for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17845)

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the robustness of Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) to non-biological technical features, introduces PathoROB for benchmarking, and proposes methods to improve FM robustness for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical FMs are transforming healthcare but risk learning non-biological technical features, posing clinical deployment risks.

Method: Developed PathoROB with novel metrics and datasets to evaluate FM robustness, tested 20 FMs, and proposed robustification methods.

Result: Found robustness deficits in all FMs, leading to diagnostic errors; robust FMs and post-hoc methods reduced but didn't eliminate risks.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluation is critical for clinical FM validation, and future FM development must prioritize robustness to ensure safe deployment.

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

TL;DR: Proposes TenVOO, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for 3D U-Net-based DDPMs in MRI image generation, achieving high performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of research on parameter-efficient representations for 3D convolution operations in MRI image generation.

Method: Introduces TenVOO, using tensor network modeling to represent 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in MS-SSIM while using only 0.3% of the original model's trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TenVOO is an effective PEFT method for 3D DDPMs, offering high performance with reduced computational costs.

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural
similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in
capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable
parameters of the original model. Our code is available at:

BraTS Local Synthesis of Tissue via Inpainting'. Our proposed method employs a
U-Net-based architecture, which is designed to effectively reconstruct the

generalization capabilities and robustness, we implement a comprehensive data
augmentation strategy that involves randomly masking healthy images during
training. Our model is trained on the BraTS-Local-Inpainting dataset and
demonstrates the exceptional performance in recovering healthy brain tissue.
The evaluation metrics employed, including Structural Similarity Index (SSIM),
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Mean Squared Error (MSE), consistently
yields impressive results. On the BraTS-Local-Inpainting validation set, our
model achieved an SSIM score of 0.841, a PSNR score of 23.257, and an MSE score
of 0.007. Notably, these evaluation metrics exhibit relatively low standard
deviations, i.e., 0.103 for SSIM score, 4.213 for PSNR score and 0.007 for MSE
score, which indicates that our model's reliability and consistency across
various input scenarios. Our method also secured first place in the challenge.

*Juexin Zhang,Ying Weng,Ke Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model for glioblastoma diagnosis, fine-tuned on BraTS-Path data, shows poor performance on validation but achieves second place in testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Glioblastoma's heterogeneity complicates diagnosis, necessitating advanced methods like deep learning for accurate assessment and treatment.

Method: A pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the BraTS-Path dataset and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-score, specificity, and MCC.

Result: The model performs poorly on validation (accuracy 0.392) but excels in specificity (0.899) and ranks second in testing.

Conclusion: Despite validation challenges, the model shows promise in specific metrics and competitive testing performance.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

### [233] [Integrating Feature Selection and Machine Learning for Nitrogen Assessment in Grapevine Leaves using In-Field Hyperspectral Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17869)
*Atif Bilal Asad,Achyut Paudel,Safal Kshetri,Chenchen Kang,Salik Ram Khanal,Nataliya Shcherbatyuk,Pierre Davadant,R. Paul Schreiner,Santosh Kalauni,Manoj Karkee,Markus Keller*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study uses hyperspectral imaging and ML models to predict nitrogen (N) concentration in grapevine leaves and canopies, identifying key spectral regions for accurate N estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nitrogen is vital for vineyards, but its variability makes precise estimation and management challenging. Hyperspectral imaging and ML can improve N monitoring.

Method: Hyperspectral images (400-1000nm) of four grapevine cultivars were analyzed. Feature selection identified key spectral bands, and ML models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) predicted N concentrations.

Result: Key spectral regions (500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, 900-950nm) were robust for N prediction. ML models achieved R² of 0.49 (canopy) and 0.57 (leaf).

Conclusion: Hyperspectral imaging combined with ML and feature selection is effective for monitoring N in vineyards, aiding precision fertilization.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained for multislice electron ptychography (MEP), enhances 3D atomic structure reconstructions by integrating with iterative solvers, improving SSIM by 90.50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative algorithms for MEP are slow and produce suboptimal solutions due to ill-posed inverse problems.

Method: Develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on crystal structures, and integrate it with iterative solvers using Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS).

Result: Hybrid approach improves reconstruction quality, achieving a 90.50% SSIM improvement.

Conclusion: MEP-Diffusion significantly enhances MEP reconstructions, offering a superior alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that
computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over
existing methods.

TL;DR: A specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis is introduced, addressing standardization and data scarcity issues with 6,719 annotated images and benchmarking results from nine deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized, large-scale annotated datasets for TCM tongue diagnosis hinders AI development and clinical application.

Method: The dataset includes 6,719 high-quality images annotated with 20 pathological symptom categories, validated by TCM practitioners, and benchmarked using nine deep learning models.

Result: The dataset supports multiple annotation formats and demonstrates utility for AI development, providing a foundation for reliable computational tools in TCM.

Conclusion: This dataset bridges the data shortage in TCM, enabling standardized AI integration into research and clinical practice.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis, while clinically
valuable, faces standardization challenges due to subjective interpretation and
inconsistent imaging protocols, compounded by the lack of large-scale,
annotated datasets for AI development. To address this gap, we present the
first specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis, comprising 6,719
high-quality images captured under standardized conditions and annotated with
20 pathological symptom categories (averaging 2.54 clinically validated labels
per image, all verified by licensed TCM practitioners). The dataset supports
multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been
benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and
MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource
provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in
TCM, bridging the data shortage that has hindered progress in the field, and
facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice
through standardized, high-quality diagnostic data.

### [236] [Hierarchical Diffusion Framework for Pseudo-Healthy Brain MRI Inpainting with Enhanced 3D Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17911)
*Dou Hoon Kwark,Shirui Luo,Xiyue Zhu,Yudu Li,Zhi-Pei Liang,Volodymyr Kindratenko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hierarchical diffusion framework for pseudo-healthy MRI inpainting balances 2D efficiency and 3D consistency by combining axial and coronal diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D inpainting methods lack volumetric consistency, while 3D models require excessive training data, making them impractical for medical use.

Method: Uses two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages: axial diffusion for global consistency and coronal diffusion for detail refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in realism and volumetric consistency.

Conclusion: The method offers a data-efficient, volumetrically consistent solution for pseudo-healthy MRI inpainting.

Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining
perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data
efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric
consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image
inpainting. Code is available at

*Deepa Krishnaswamy,Cosmin Ciausu,Steve Pieper,Ron Kikinis,Benjamin Billot,Andrey Fedorov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A benchmarking study compares MRI abdominal segmentation tools, highlighting MRSegmentator as the top performer and introducing ABDSynth, a CT-trained alternative for limited annotation budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI segmentation is challenging due to signal variability and annotation effort, limiting generalizability of existing tools.

Method: Three state-of-the-art models (MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, TotalSegmentator MRI) and ABDSynth (trained on CT) are benchmarked using public datasets.

Result: MRSegmentator performs best; ABDSynth is less accurate but viable with limited annotation resources.

Conclusion: The study provides tools and datasets for future benchmarking, promoting generalizable MRI segmentation solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights

*Hang Xu,Alexandre Bousse,Alessandro Perelli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes DEcomp-MoD, a deep learning method for direct material decomposition from DECT projection data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DECT material decomposition methods are post-reconstruction, ignoring beam-hardening effects, leading to sub-optimal results.

Method: Uses a model-based conditional diffusion model to convert sinogram data directly into material images, incorporating spectral DECT knowledge into training.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised methods on synthetic DECT data.

Conclusion: DEcomp-MoD shows clinical potential for accurate material decomposition.

Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UniSegDiff improves lesion segmentation by addressing uneven attention in diffusion models with staged training and inference, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models suffer from uneven attention across timesteps, leading to inefficiencies in training and suboptimal results for lesion segmentation.

Method: Proposes UniSegDiff, a framework with staged training and inference, dynamically adjusting prediction targets and pre-training feature extraction for unified segmentation.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in lesion segmentation across six organs and multiple imaging modalities.

Conclusion: UniSegDiff effectively addresses diffusion model limitations, offering a robust solution for unified lesion segmentation.

Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology by introducing a high-quality dataset and a prompt argumentation strategy, improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology suffer from data noise, incomplete annotations, and lack of transparency in reasoning, leading to unreliable outputs in clinical settings.

Method: The authors construct a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations and propose a prompt argumentation strategy. They also use supervised fine-tuning and GRPO to enhance reasoning and output quality.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors.

Conclusion: The proposed solution significantly enhances the accuracy and clinical utility of pathology report generation, making it more reliable for practical use.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.

*Milad Taghipour,Bane Vasic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper applies reinforcement learning to improve decoding of linear block codes by mapping the process into MDPs, reducing state complexity, and proposing action-list decoding and feedback-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of decoding linear block codes using reinforcement learning, addressing complexity and efficiency challenges.

Method: Mapping decoding to MDPs, reducing states via truncated MDPs, action-list decoding with Deep-Q networks, leveraging code automorphism, and feedback-based enhancement of existing decoders.

Result: Improved decoding performance for LDPC codes over BSC, with reduced complexity and enhanced efficiency.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning effectively optimizes decoding processes, offering scalable and efficient solutions for linear block codes.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

*Amirarsalan Moatazedian,Yauhen Yakimenka,Rémi A. Chou,Jörg Kliewer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving data-sharing framework is studied, where a privatizer sanitizes data for a reconstructor and two adversaries. The goal is to limit reconstructor distortion while maximizing adversaries' loss, ensuring accurate reconstruction only through collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scenarios where individual adversaries cannot accurately reconstruct data, but combined side information allows it, mimicking secret-sharing principles with lossy recovery.

Method: A constrained minimax optimization problem is framed, solved via a data-driven training procedure updating privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries alternately. Special Gaussian and binary cases are analyzed for optimal solutions.

Result: Theoretical optimal solutions for Gaussian and binary cases serve as benchmarks, validating the proposed minimax training approach.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances privacy and utility, enabling accurate reconstruction only through collaboration, with theoretical benchmarks supporting the method's efficacy.

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of AI/ML in 5G RAN, highlighting challenges like model drift and vendor lock-in, and reviews 3GPP's evolving LCM framework from Releases 16-20. It outlines a five-block LCM architecture and identifies open challenges for AI-native 6G transceivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized LCM for AI/ML models in 5G RAN, which hinders large-scale adoption due to issues like model drift and vendor lock-in.

Method: Reviews 3GPP's progressive standardization efforts (Releases 16-20) for AI/ML LCM, including interfaces for model transfer, execution, monitoring, and control.

Result: A five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven monitoring, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes are developed, but challenges like resource-efficient monitoring and environment drift detection remain.

Conclusion: The advancements in AI/ML LCM for 5G RAN set the stage for AI-native transceivers in 6G, though unresolved challenges persist.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

*Mingkun Xia,Haitao Lin,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Hi-π combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression to discover key dimensionless parameters in high-dimensional systems, validated across fluid mechanics examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of redundant dimensionless parameters in high-dimensional systems to establish physically meaningful descriptions.

Method: Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-π), a physics-data hybrid-driven approach integrating dimensional analysis and symbolic regression.

Result: Accurately extracted key dimensionless parameters (e.g., Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers) in fluid mechanics, balancing accuracy and complexity.

Conclusion: Hi-π effectively discovers hierarchical dimensionless parameters, demonstrating broad applicability in fluid mechanics.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication cost is a bottleneck in FL, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Proposes caching strategies (FIFO, LRU, Priority-Based) to selectively forward significant model updates.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves

*Felix Quinque,Alan Aboudib,Szymon Fonau,Rodrigo Lopez Portillo Alcocer,Brian McCrindle,Steffen Cruz*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: IOTA improves Bittensor's SN9 by enabling distributed, scalable LLM pretraining with fair incentives, addressing issues like model hoarding and local constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in SN9, such as isolated training and unfair rewards, by fostering cooperation and scalability in decentralized LLM pretraining.

Method: IOTA uses a SWARM architecture for data- and pipeline-parallel training, granular incentives, activation compression, Butterfly All-Reduce, and CLASP for fair attribution.

Result: Preliminary results show scalable model sizes, improved training speed, fair rewards, and collusion detection.

Conclusion: IOTA successfully addresses SN9's issues, enabling scalable, fair, and efficient decentralized LLM pretraining.

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

### [247] [PolyServe: Efficient Multi-SLO Serving at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17769)
*Kan Zhu,Haiyang Shi,Le Xu,Jiaxin Shan,Arvind Krishnamurthy,Baris Kasikci,Liguang Xie*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PolyServe is a multi-SLO scheduling policy for LLM-powered applications, optimizing throughput and SLO attainment by grouping requests and managing server load dynamically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current systems inadequately address diverse latency requirements in LLM applications, leading to suboptimal scheduling and user experiences.

Method: PolyServe groups requests by latency requirements, routes them to suitable servers, and uses profiling for dynamic scheduling and tail latency control.

Result: PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain and up to 92.5% of optimal goodput compared to existing policies.

Conclusion: PolyServe effectively addresses multi-SLO scheduling challenges, improving performance and resource utilization in LLM applications.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MultiKernelBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based deep learning kernel generation, addressing limitations like limited hardware support and imbalanced task coverage. It spans 285 tasks across 14 kernel categories and supports Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based DL kernel generation lack hardware diversity, fine-grained categorization, and balanced task coverage, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The authors introduce MultiKernelBench with a modular backend abstraction layer for extensibility and propose a category-aware one-shot prompting method to improve generation quality.

Result: Evaluations of seven LLMs show variations in task difficulty, poor generalization to less-exposed platforms, and the effectiveness of targeted prompting.

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench provides a scalable, extensible benchmark for LLM-based DL kernel generation, highlighting the need for better generalization and prompting strategies.

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

### [249] [VERIRAG: Healthcare Claim Verification via Statistical Audit in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17948)
*Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shusen Liu,Christine Klymko,Shashank Kushwaha,Derek Shi,Wesam Sakla,Sainyam Galhotra,Ruben Glatt*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VERIRAG introduces a framework to vet scientific quality in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for clinical decision support, outperforming baselines with improved F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems treat all retrieved evidence as equally credible, ignoring scientific rigor, which can mislead clinical decisions.

Method: VERIRAG includes a checklist (Veritable), a quality-weighted aggregator (HV Score), and a dynamic threshold for evidence acceptance.

Result: VERIRAG outperforms baselines with F1 scores of 0.53 to 0.65, improving by 10-14 points.

Conclusion: VERIRAG enhances the reliability of RAG systems by vetting evidence quality, ensuring more accurate clinical decision support.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in prior case retrieval (PCR) by using LLM-based text embedders, which outperform traditional methods like BM25 and supervised transformer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient prior case retrieval in legal systems due to the growing volume of cases, and the limitations of current IR methods in handling lengthy legal texts and lack of training data.

Method: Leveraging LLM-based text embedders to handle longer input lengths and operate unsupervised, eliminating the need for training data.

Result: LLM-based embedders outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models in four PCR benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-based embedders are a promising solution for PCR, addressing key challenges and improving retrieval performance.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

*Zhengyun Zhao,Huaiyuan Ying,Yue Zhong,Sheng Yu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR.EHR, a dense retrieval model for EHRs, using a two-stage training pipeline with medical knowledge injection and large-scale data generation. It outperforms existing models on the CliniQ benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR retrieval is challenging due to semantic gaps, and existing models lack sufficient medical knowledge or suitable training data.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: 1) medical entity extraction and knowledge injection, 2) training data generation using large language models. Two model variants (110M and 7B parameters) are trained.

Result: DR.EHR achieves state-of-the-art results on CliniQ, excelling in semantic matches like implication and abbreviation. Ablation studies confirm pipeline effectiveness.

Conclusion: DR.EHR advances EHR retrieval, offering a robust solution for clinical applications, with demonstrated generalizability.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

*Maria Vlachou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fashion-AlterEval, a dataset with human judgments for alternative items in fashion CRS, and proposes meta-user simulators to improve evaluation by considering alternatives and user patience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CRS simulators focus on a single target item and lack realism in user patience, limiting offline evaluation.

Method: The authors create Fashion-AlterEval by annotating fashion CRS datasets and develop two meta-user simulators that incorporate alternative items and dynamic patience.

Result: Experiments show that single-target evaluation underestimates CRS effectiveness, and considering alternatives leads to faster user satisfaction.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances CRS evaluation by addressing limitations of single-target simulators and incorporating realistic user behavior.

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

TL;DR: Sandwich is a CPU-based LLM serving engine that optimizes prefill and decode phases separately, outperforming existing solutions with higher throughput and lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CPU-based LLM serving solutions are suboptimal due to static partitioning and vendor libraries, ignoring workload differences between prefill and decode phases.

Method: Sandwich uses different execution plans for prefill and decode phases, optimizing them separately, and evaluates on various CPU platforms.

Result: Sandwich achieves 2.01x higher throughput, 90% satisfactory latencies, and outperforms vendor kernels with lower tuning costs.

Conclusion: Sandwich demonstrates significant improvements in CPU-based LLM serving, offering a resource-friendly alternative to GPUs.

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

Motivation: To extend CCA for real-time, high-dimensional streaming data analysis.

Method: Uses streaming PCA and a sliding window of samples to estimate CCA components online.

Conclusion: SWICCA is effective for real-time, high-dimensional correlated feature analysis in streaming data.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated

Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a

numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a
theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable
to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the power and reliability of A/B testing for policy evaluation and product deployment in tech companies.

Result: Demonstrated efficacy via asymptotic theories, numerical experiments, and real-world ridesharing data, showing superior performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches, offering a robust solution for A/B testing.

Abstract: A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing

TL;DR: The paper addresses training data reconstruction attacks in machine learning, introducing a mathematical framework, identifying vulnerable data features, and proposing a score matching method for reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate vulnerabilities in machine learning models where adversaries can reconstruct training data from model specifications and parameters.

Method: Develops a mathematical framework, uses maximum mean discrepancy to identify vulnerable features, and introduces a score matching framework for data reconstruction in Bayesian and non-Bayesian models.

Result: The paper successfully outlines methods to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in training data reconstruction, including a novel Bayesian approach.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical vulnerabilities in machine learning models and provides tools for both understanding and exploiting them, emphasizing the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Publicly releasing the specification of a model with its trained parameters
means an adversary can attempt to reconstruct information about the training
data via training data reconstruction attacks, a major vulnerability of modern
machine learning methods. This paper makes three primary contributions:
establishing a mathematical framework to express the problem, characterising
the features of the training data that are vulnerable via a maximum mean
discrepancy equivalance and outlining a score matching framework for
reconstructing data in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, the former is a
first in the literature.

Result: DriftMoE achieves competitive performance across nine benchmarks, handling abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts effectively.

Conclusion: DriftMoE offers a principled, efficient solution for concept drift adaptation, outperforming existing methods in specialized knowledge utilization.

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE
achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art stream learning adaptive
ensembles, offering a principled and efficient approach to concept drift
adaptation. All code, data pipelines, and reproducibility scripts are available

*Keyi Li,Yuval Kluger,Boris Landa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to estimate and correct pairwise Euclidean distances distorted by heteroskedastic noise in high-dimensional settings, with theoretical guarantees and experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heteroskedastic noise distorts pairwise Euclidean distances, misrepresenting data geometry, which affects machine learning and data analysis tasks.

Method: A hyperparameter-free approach jointly estimates noise magnitudes and corrects distances, validated theoretically and experimentally.

Result: The method provides accurate noise and distance estimates, improving robustness in distance-based computations, as shown in synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Conclusion: The approach reliably addresses heteroskedastic noise without prior assumptions, enhancing distance-based analyses in high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to enable robots to interpret complex language instructions and generate navigation trajectories, validated on autonomous vehicle datasets and a Husky robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between language descriptions and robot actions in open-world navigation tasks remains a challenge, despite LLMs' common-sense reasoning abilities.

Method: Leverages MLLMs' cross-modal understanding and code-generation to integrate semantic knowledge with spatial maps, creating 2D bird-eye-view value maps for navigation.

Result: The framework successfully executes diverse free-form navigation instructions, showing robustness against detection errors and linguistic ambiguities in both indoor and outdoor settings.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates real-world applicability and robustness, validated on large-scale datasets and physical robots.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

TL;DR: MoRPI-PINN, a physics-informed neural network, improves inertial-based robot navigation by 85% by embedding physical laws, enabling accurate and lightweight solutions for edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate navigation is critical for autonomous robots in GPS/camera-denied environments, but inertial sensors alone suffer from drift due to noise and errors.

Method: Proposes MoRPI-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that integrates physical laws to enhance inertial signal-to-noise ratio for drift mitigation.

Result: Achieves over 85% accuracy improvement in real-world experiments compared to other methods.

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN is a robust, lightweight solution for accurate inertial navigation, suitable for edge devices and typical mobile robot applications.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

TL;DR: ReSem3D unifies MLLMs and VFMs for fine-grained 3D spatial constraints in robotic manipulation, addressing limitations like coarse semantics and lack of real-time planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with semantic granularity, real-time planning, and robustness in diverse environments.

Method: Hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs interacts with VFMs to construct 3D constraints from language and RGB-D data, encoded as real-time optimization objectives.

Result: ReSem3D achieves zero-shot manipulation in diverse environments, showing adaptability and generalization.

Conclusion: The framework advances robotic manipulation by integrating semantic reasoning and real-time execution.

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using the MediaPipe algorithm for facial landmark detection in surgery, testing it with a robotic arm under controlled lighting. Results show improved accuracy at larger angles, though dispersion increases due to landmark imprecision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like variable lighting and flexible detection positions in medical applications of face detection algorithms.

Method: Testing the MediaPipe algorithm with a robotic arm in a controlled setting, adjusting positions while keeping surgical light and phantom fixed.

Result: Improved facial landmark detection accuracy under surgical lighting, especially at larger yaw and pitch angles, but with increased dispersion due to imprecise landmark detection.

Conclusion: The study suggests potential for integrating MediaPipe into medical procedures, despite some limitations in landmark precision.

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaRPG is a framework using foundation models to improve manipulation of articulated objects by focusing on part-level affordances and leveraging common knowledge for adaptive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in manipulating articulated objects due to geometric diversity and functional variations by enhancing visual affordance generalization and adaptive strategies.

Method: Proposes AdaRPG, which extracts object parts for local geometric similarity, uses a part-level affordance dataset, and employs foundation models for reasoning and control code generation.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization across novel articulated object categories in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: AdaRPG effectively addresses manipulation challenges by combining part-level affordance learning and adaptive control, showing promise for diverse articulated objects.

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for semi-automatic annotation of large language model (LLM) embedding spaces using mapper graphs, leveraging customizable LLM-based agents for scalable analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually exploring LLM embedding spaces to uncover linguistic properties is labor-intensive, necessitating an automated approach.

Method: A taxonomy of mapper graph elements is defined, and two types of LLM-based agents use perturbation techniques for annotation and analysis.

Result: The framework successfully replicates prior findings on BERT's embeddings and provides new insights into linguistic properties of topological neighborhoods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables efficient and robust exploration of LLM embedding spaces, enhancing understanding of their topological and linguistic structures.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

Conclusion: The conjectures serve as both mathematical challenges and reflections on AI's role in creative mathematical discovery, inviting further engagement.

Abstract: We present four open conjectures in graph theory generated by the automated

mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and
now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures
invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke

Motivation: To accurately predict cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli by integrating visual, auditory, and semantic information over time.

Method: Uses modality-specific bidirectional RNNs to encode temporal dynamics, fuses hidden states, and employs lightweight subject-specific heads for cortical parcel responses. Training involves a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum focusing on sensory to association regions.

Result: Achieved an overall Pearson r = 0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63), with notable gains for challenging subjects.

Conclusion: The model provides a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject

Motivation: To explore the implications of different GNN architectures in cheminformatics for toxicological assay classification.

Method: Compared GCNs, GATs, and GINs on 7 assay datasets using Bayesian optimization and 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: GINs outperformed in data-abundant assays (AUC 0.728-0.849), while GATs excelled in data-scarce ones. GINs showed unique optimization behavior.

Conclusion: GINs are optimal for data-rich environments, GATs for data-scarce ones, highlighting architecture-specific strengths.

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

Motivation: The challenge of accurate coronary artery segmentation due to limited annotated datasets hinders disease diagnosis and management.

Method: CM-UNet leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated data and fine-tuning with limited annotated images (18 vs. 500).

Result: Fine-tuning with 18 images reduced Dice score drop to 15.2% vs. 46.5% in baseline models, showing improved performance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning enhances segmentation accuracy, reduces manual annotation needs, and improves clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

TL;DR: A machine learning workflow is introduced to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymers using atomistic data, reducing reliance on biased single order parameters and achieving high classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying crystallization pathways in polymers rely on preset cut-off points on single order parameters, which introduce biases and sensitivity issues.

Method: An integrated machine learning workflow combines high-dimensional feature vectors, low-dimensional embeddings, and unsupervised clustering to identify crystalline and amorphous atoms. Supervised learning then identifies a minimal set of order parameters.

Result: The workflow achieves over 0.98 AUC classification performance, defining a crystallinity index (C-index) that remains bimodal and efficient for on-the-fly computation.

Conclusion: The workflow offers a data-driven approach for order parameter selection and monitoring structural transformations, supporting the role of entropy in early nucleation and symmetry in later stages.

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

### [273] [Automated Code Review Using Large Language Models with Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18476)
*Busra Icoz,Goksel Biricik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs improves automated code review accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code review is subjective and time-consuming, and while LLMs show promise, they lack logical reasoning for full code evaluation.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, tested on the CodexGlue dataset with models like CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT.

Result: The hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs is effective for automating code review.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

### [274] [On the Energy Distribution of the Galactic Center Excess' Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17804)
*Florian List,Yujin Park,Nicholas L. Rodd,Eve Schoen,Florian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) using a neural network-aided approach to analyze spatial and spectral data, challenging the point-source hypothesis and suggesting a diffuse nature or an exceptionally large number of sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The GCE's origin is unclear, with debates between dark matter annihilation and dim point sources. Prior analyses lacked spectral data, limiting insights.

Method: A neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach is used to analyze both spatial and spectral data of the GCE.

Result: Energy information suggests dimmer point sources, aligning the GCE with diffuse emission or a vast number of sources (tens of thousands). The findings are consistent with Poisson emission from dark matter.

Conclusion: The GCE is likely diffuse or composed of an exceptionally large number of sources, challenging earlier point-source hypotheses and supporting dark matter interpretations.

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

### [275] [Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control I: Penalty Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18114)
*Lechen Feng,Xun Li,Yuan-Hua Ni*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A unified nonconvex optimization framework for designing group-sparse feedback controllers in LQ problems, addressing DFT-LQ and SF-LQ extensions with scalable control needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, structure-aware control in large-scale systems without relying on convex relaxations or restrictive assumptions.

Method: Formulates controller synthesis as a nonconvex optimization problem with group ℓ0-norm regularization, proposes a PALM algorithm for solving it.

Result: Establishes a connection between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ, provides global convergence guarantees for critical points.

Conclusion: Fills a literature gap by directly designing group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, avoiding convex surrogates.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

TL;DR: The paper surveys Financial Foundation Models (FFMs), categorizing them into FinLFMs, FinTSFMs, and FinVLFMs, and reviews their architectures, training, datasets, and applications. It highlights challenges like data scarcity and scalability, offering future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini lack domain-specific capabilities for finance, prompting the development of FFMs to address unique financial requirements such as regulatory compliance and multimodal reasoning.

Method: The survey categorizes FFMs into three modalities (FinLFMs, FinTSFMs, FinVLFMs), reviews their architectures, training methods, datasets, and applications, and identifies key challenges.

Result: FFMs show promise in financial tasks but face challenges like data availability, scalability, and infrastructure. The survey provides a taxonomy and future research directions.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a reference for FFMs and a roadmap for future innovation, with ongoing updates on a dedicated GitHub repository.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with
strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial
engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have
demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report
summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications
remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,
regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related

TL;DR: Dual-agent LLM setups outperform single agents in math problem-solving, with peer-to-peer collaboration being most effective. Communication strategies like statements, acknowledgment, and hints are crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the impact of different communication strategies among LLM agents in collaborative problem-solving for AI-aided education.

Method: Examined four communication modes (teacher-student interaction, peer-to-peer collaboration, reciprocal peer teaching, critical debate) in a dual-agent, chat-based math problem-solving environment using GPT-4o, tested on the MATH dataset.

Result: Dual-agent setups outperformed single agents, with peer-to-peer collaboration achieving the highest accuracy. Key dialogue acts (statements, acknowledgment, hints) were identified as critical.

Conclusion: Multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, but effective communication strategies are essential for solving complex problems in AI education.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address clinician burnout by automating documentation tasks in healthcare.

Method: Integration of Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with GPT-4o for generating SOAP notes and patient instructions. Post-processing with a fine-tuned BART model improves conciseness.

Result: Notes exceed expert-written quality; 94% of clinicians report reduced cognitive load, and 97% report less documentation burden. Over 540 clinicians adopted the application.

Conclusion: AI systems can effectively reduce administrative burdens and enhance clinical efficiency.

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,
high-quality care.

Motivation: To rethink traditional workflows in human-centered design as AI evolves into an interactive, generative collaborator.

Method: Investigates the use of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and multimodal diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) in iterative cycles of proposal, critique, and revision.

Result: Demonstrates AI's role as a creative agent in design processes.

Conclusion: Human-AI co-creation represents a new paradigm for early-stage design, enhancing ideation and decision-making.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve from a back-end
computational tool into an interactive, generative collaborator, its
integration into early-stage design processes demands a rethinking of
traditional workflows in human-centered design. This paper explores the
emergent paradigm of human-AI co-creation, where AI is not merely used for
automation or efficiency gains, but actively participates in ideation, visual
conceptualization, and decision-making. Specifically, we investigate the use of

TL;DR: PosterMate, a poster design assistant, uses AI-generated persona agents to simulate diverse audience feedback, aiding in collaborative design edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of gathering and reconciling diverse audience feedback for poster design.

Method: PosterMate creates persona agents from marketing documents, gathers their feedback, and uses a moderator to synthesize edits.

Result: User studies showed PosterMate captures overlooked viewpoints and synthesizes diverse perspectives effectively.

Conclusion: PosterMate demonstrates potential as a prototyping tool for collaborative design feedback.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

TL;DR: The paper explores educator-AI interactions via a human-AI collaborative method, analyzing 140K messages to study LLMs' role in qualitative coding and educator practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how educators use AI tools in practice and develop scalable methods for studying these interactions.

Method: A four-phase coding pipeline combining inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking.

Result: LLMs, especially Claude 3.5 Haiku, reliably support theme identification and outperform other models. Educators primarily use AI for instruction enhancement (79.7%), content creation (76.1%), and assessment (46.9%).

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable model for AI-augmented research and insights into AI's role in education, with implications for teacher training.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting
emerging AI-related competencies that have direct implications for teacher
preparation and professional development. This study offers a scalable,
transparent model for AI-augmented qualitative research and provides
foundational insights into the evolving role of generative AI in educational
practice.

rapid analysis, and in a raw state, for in-depth exploration of novel insights
captured in the study. Conclusions: This dataset has a range of potential
applications. The quantitative elements can support blood glucose prediction,
hypoglycaemia prediction, and closed-loop algorithm development. The
qualitative elements enable the exploration of user experiences and opinions,

large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study analyzes 1.5 million posts from 400 KOLs on X (2021-2023) to explore anticipatory discourse on tech futures, revealing their role in shaping optimistic and anxious narratives around AI and other emerging technologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how KOLs frame technological futures and influence societal debates amid uncertainty.

Method: Analyzed posts using BERTopic modelling, sentiment, emotion, and attitude analyses.

Result: Identified 100 topics; Hope dominated, but Anxiety arose in discussions like climate change and geopolitics. KOLs mediate narratives, linking futures to current realities.

Conclusion: KOLs play a key role in shaping public discourse on emerging tech, balancing optimism and anxiety to influence societal perceptions.

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the definability issue of Rumsfeld ignorance by assuming different accessibility relations, leading to axiomatizations over bi-frame classes and application to Fine's results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trivialization caused by Rumsfeld ignorance being definable in terms of ignorance, by assuming distinct accessibility relations.

Method: Assume two different accessibility relations (one a subset of the other) to avoid definability issues and retain validities. Axiomatize over bi-frame classes.

Result: Axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame classes are achieved, avoiding trivialization.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses the definability issue and applies to Fine's results, retaining logical properties.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

### [290] [Approximate SMT Counting Beyond Discrete Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18612)
*Arijit Shaw,Kuldeep S. Meel*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: pact is a hybrid SMT model counter using hashing-based approximation for efficient solution estimation with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending SMT solvers' capabilities to model counting for hybrid formulas, addressing limitations of existing discrete-only methods.

Method: pact employs hashing-based approximate model counting, making logarithmic SMT solver calls relative to projection variables.

Result: pact significantly outperforms baselines, completing 603 out of 14,202 instances compared to the baseline's 13.

Conclusion: pact demonstrates a scalable and efficient approach for model counting in hybrid SMT formulas.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning,
solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent
progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities
toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches,
like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the
challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid
formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses
hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical
guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the
projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves
significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of
benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished
on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.

### [291] [Digital Twin Technologies in Predictive Maintenance: Enabling Transferability via Sim-to-Real and Real-to-Sim Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18449)
*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of standardizing Digital Twins (DTs) by focusing on transferability, particularly 'sim-to-real' and 'real-to-sim' knowledge transfer. It introduces a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module to manage discrepancies between simulations and real-world outcomes, validated through a case study on a pedestrian bridge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized frameworks hinders the transition of DTs from academia to industry. The paper aims to bridge the 'reality gap' to enhance lifecycle management in DTs.

Method: The research integrates an RGA module into an existing DT framework, using data pipelines to connect it with historical repositories and simulation models. A case study on a pedestrian bridge evaluates the approach.

Result: Full implementation of the RGA module enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations without efficiency loss.

Conclusion: The proposed RGA module effectively manages transferability in DTs, demonstrating practical utility through a real-world case study.

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of chaotic workloads (e.g., DDoS attacks) on 5G core functions, emphasizing the need for diverse resource profiles and kernel-based monitoring for SLA compliance and scalable security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in 5G core deployments, particularly under chaotic workloads like DDoS attacks, and ensure SLA compliance.

Method: Analyzes effects of DDoS on NFs using empirical evaluation and packet capture approaches, including kernel-based monitoring.

Result: Highlights the necessity of diverse resource profiles and demonstrates kernel-based monitoring's potential for scalable security.

Conclusion: Effective deployment of 5G NFs requires adaptive resource provisioning and robust monitoring, especially under chaotic workloads.

*Haoran Gao,Yuanhe Zhang,Zhenhong Zhou,Lei Jiang,Fanyu Meng,Yujia Xiao,Kun Wang,Yang Liu,Junlan Feng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RECALLED is the first method exploiting visual inputs to trigger unbounded resource consumption attacks (RCAs) in large vision-language models (LVLMs), increasing latency and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming studies overlook visual inputs as an attack surface, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to RCAs.

Method: RECALLED uses Vision Guided Optimization for pixel-level adversarial perturbations and Multi-Objective Parallel Losses for universal attack templates.

Result: RECALLED increases response latency by over 26× and raises GPU utilization and memory consumption by 20%.

Conclusion: The study highlights LVLM vulnerabilities and provides a framework for future RCA defense development.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoRA-Leak, a framework to evaluate Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on LoRA fine-tuned LMs, showing they remain vulnerable despite small parameter tuning. It also explores defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIAs overlook information leakage from pre-trained models, posing privacy risks for LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs.

Method: LoRA-Leak integrates 15 MIAs (10 existing, 5 improved) and tests them on three LMs across NLP tasks.

Result: LoRA fine-tuned LMs are vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC). Dropout and layer exclusion are effective defenses.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models exacerbate MIA risks for LoRA-based LMs, highlighting the need for privacy-aware fine-tuning.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Motivation: Existing phishing datasets lack diversity and quality, limiting ML model performance. MeAJOR Corpus aims to overcome these limitations by integrating diverse samples and engineered features.

Method: The paper merges 135,894 phishing and legitimate emails from multiple sources, with engineered features. It evaluates four ML models (RF, XGB, MLP, CNN) across feature configurations.

Result: The dataset achieves a high F1 score of 98.34% with XGBoost, demonstrating effectiveness for phishing detection research.

Conclusion: MeAJOR Corpus provides a reusable, balanced, and generalizable resource, addressing key challenges in phishing detection research.

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by
exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious
payloads. While Machine Learning (ML) models are effective at detecting
phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity
of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from
Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email
dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It
integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and
legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated
the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic
experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple
categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while
addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security measures struggle with evolving threats, prompting the need for intelligent solutions like LLMs to improve accuracy and reduce false alarms.

Method: The study reviews LLM applications in security tasks, leveraging neural networks and Transformer architecture, and analyzes their technical advantages.

Result: LLMs improve detection accuracy and reduce false alarm rates in security systems, but challenges remain in transparency and adaptability.

Conclusion: Further research is needed to optimize LLM structures and enhance generalization for smarter, more precise security systems.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

### [297] [NWaaS: Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service for X-to-Image DNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18036)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Yu Guo,Hangcheng Cao,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A nonintrusive DNN watermarking method, ShadowMark, is introduced to protect model IP without altering the model, ensuring fidelity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN watermarking methods are intrusive, raising concerns about behavior shifts and costs, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Proposes NWaaS and ShadowMark, a nonintrusive approach using a side channel in the model's black-box API with a key encoder and watermark decoder.

Result: ShadowMark achieves absolute fidelity, works across DNN architectures, and resists attacks, demonstrated in various image models.

Conclusion: ShadowMark enables practical, nonintrusive watermarking, addressing fidelity and robustness trade-offs for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models using Grid-LoRA adapters and Grid Fill, eliminating per-instance fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic concept personalization require per-instance fine-tuning, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses structured 2x2 video grids and lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing/composition, with a Grid Fill module for inference.

Result: Produces high-quality, temporally coherent outputs without test-time optimization, generalizing to unseen concepts.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and effective for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GeoAvatar improves 3D head avatar generation by balancing identity preservation and animation using adaptive Gaussian splatting, mouth structure enhancements, and a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle varying geometrical deviations in facial regions, leading to suboptimal quality in avatar generation.

Method: GeoAvatar uses Adaptive Pre-allocation Stage (APS) for Gaussian segmentation, introduces a mouth structure for better animation, and employs a regularization loss for rigging.

Result: GeoAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and animation, validated by experiments.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar effectively addresses challenges in 3D head avatar generation, offering improved quality and fidelity.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for training small, efficient models for real-time, on-device speech-driven 3D facial animation using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling, reducing memory footprint and audio context requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of large, diverse datasets for speech-driven 3D facial animation and the prohibitive size of existing models limit their use to offline inference. The goal is to enable real-time, on-device applications, particularly in game development.

Method: Hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling is used. A high-performing teacher model trains small student models (convolutional and fully-connected layers only), eliminating the need for attention or recurrent updates.

Result: The student models achieve a memory footprint as low as 3.4 MB and require only up to 81 ms of future audio context while maintaining high-quality animations.

Conclusion: This approach enables efficient on-device inference, advancing realistic, model-driven digital characters for applications like gaming.

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

TL;DR: PS-GS integrates Gaussian Splatting with MVPS for efficient inverse rendering, improving 3D reconstruction accuracy and enabling novel-view synthesis, relighting, and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inverse rendering methods with fixed illumination lack accuracy. MVPS offers better results but remains inefficient.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting for initial geometry, deferred inverse rendering with a lighting MLP, and regularizes normals with photometric stereo. Introduces 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for lighting refinement.

Result: Outperforms prior works in accuracy and efficiency on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: PS-GS effectively combines MVPS and inverse rendering, enabling advanced applications like relighting and material editing.

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

### [305] [A Supervised Machine Learning Framework for Multipactor Breakdown Prediction in High-Power Radio Frequency Devices and Accelerator Components: A Case Study in Planar Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17881)
*Asif Iqbal,John Verboncoeur,Peng Zhang*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: This study applies supervised ML to predict multipactor susceptibility in RF devices, using simulation-derived data and evaluating tree-based models and MLPs. Tree-based models generalize better, while MLPs benefit from multi-objective optimization. PCA highlights dataset limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate multipactor prediction is critical for RF device and accelerator design but computationally intensive. ML offers a potential solution.

Method: Uses simulation data to train RF, ET, XGBoost, and MLPs for predicting electron growth rate. Evaluates performance with IoU, SSIM, and Pearson correlation.

Result: Tree-based models outperform MLPs in generalization. MLPs with multi-objective optimization perform better than single-objective ones. PCA reveals dataset gaps.

Conclusion: ML shows promise for multipactor prediction but requires broader dataset coverage for robust performance.

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

### [306] [Hybrid Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Quantum Circuit Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16641)
*Sara Giordano,Kornikar Sen,Miguel A. Martin-Delgado*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: An RL framework for synthesizing quantum circuits efficiently, using Q-learning and hybrid rewards, achieves minimal-depth circuits for target quantum states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of quantum circuit synthesis in both NISQ and fault-tolerant quantum computing by managing exponential state-space growth.

Method: Uses tabular Q-learning with action sequences in discretized quantum state space, hybrid rewards (static and dynamic penalties), and sparse matrix representations.

Result: Demonstrates minimal-depth circuits for graph-state preparation (up to 7 qubits) and universal gate sets, with optimized gate counts.

Conclusion: The RL approach efficiently explores quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal circuits, offering a resource-efficient foundation for optimization.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit
optimization.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL) combines quantum and classical methods for faster decision-making in partially observable environments, outperforming classical RL in sparse Bayesian networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computing for accelerating reinforcement learning in partially observable environments, addressing the computational inefficiencies of classical methods.

Method: Introduces QBRL, a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm using quantum rejection sampling and amplitude amplification for belief updates in sparse Bayesian networks.

Result: QBRL achieves sub-quadratic speedup in near-optimal planning, with performance varying across deployment settings.

Conclusion: QBRL demonstrates quantum computational advantages in RL, though the extent of improvement depends on specific environmental conditions.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

### [309] [A Foundation Model for Massive MIMO Precoding with an Adaptive per-User Rate-Power Tradeoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18587)
*Jérôme Emery,Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan,Jean-François Frigon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding reduces energy consumption and adapts to per-user rate requirements, outperforming traditional methods with lower complexity. Data augmentation addresses data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based precoding in mMIMO systems requires high-quality local datasets, which are hard to collect, limiting practical implementation.

Method: Proposes a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding, minimizing energy consumption and adapting dynamically to user requirements. Introduces a data augmentation method using cosine similarity for adaptation in data-scarce settings.

Result: Zero-shot deployment outperforms zero forcing and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8x less complexity. Data augmentation improves adaptation.

Conclusion: The work enables practical DL-based mMIMO solutions by addressing data scarcity and training complexity, offering dynamic control for resource allocation.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

### [310] [ASR-Guided Speaker-Role Diarization and Diarization-Guided ASR Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17765)
*Arindam Ghosh,Mark Fuhs,Bongjun Kim,Anurag Chowdhury,Monika Woszczyna*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper extends end-to-end ASR + SD models to speaker-role diarization (RD), simplifying training, proposing separate predictors for word and role tasks, and leveraging RD to improve ASR decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speaker diarization (SD) uses generic labels, while speaker-role diarization (RD) (e.g., doctor vs. patient) is more useful for applications. The paper aims to enhance joint ASR + SD models by incorporating RD.

Method: The framework extends end-to-end ASR + SD models to RD. Key methods include: (1) simplified training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss, (2) separate predictors for word and role tasks due to differing context needs, and (3) using RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding.

Result: The proposed approach improves RD performance by addressing context-specific needs for word and role predictions and reduces small-word deletion errors in ASR.

Conclusion: The paper successfully integrates RD into joint ASR + SD models, demonstrating improved performance and practical utility over traditional SD.

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of
RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require
different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific
predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way
to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce
small-word deletion errors.

### [311] [Recent Trends in Distant Conversational Speech Recognition: A Review of CHiME-7 and 8 DASR Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18161)
*Samuele Cornell,Christoph Boeddeker,Taejin Park,He Huang,Desh Raj,Matthew Wiesner,Yoshiki Masuyama,Xuankai Chang,Zhong-Qiu Wang,Stefano Squartini,Paola Garcia,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The CHiME-7 and 8 challenges highlight trends in multi-channel ASR and diarization, showing a shift to end-to-end systems, reliance on guided source separation, and the importance of diarization refinement. Challenges remain in transcription accuracy and neural SSE techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges aim to advance research in multi-channel, generalizable ASR and diarization of conversational speech by evaluating diverse systems and identifying key trends.

Method: The paper analyzes submissions from 9 teams (32 systems), focusing on design, metrics, datasets, and baseline systems. Key trends include the use of end-to-end ASR, guided source separation, and diarization refinement.

Result: Findings show a shift to end-to-end ASR due to pre-trained models, reliance on guided source separation, and the critical role of diarization refinement. Transcription accuracy remains challenging.

Conclusion: Despite progress, challenges persist in neural SSE techniques and transcription accuracy, even with advanced system ensembles.

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores Explainable AI (XAI) to improve interpretability of deep learning models for diagnosing voice disorders, comparing concept-based models (CBM, CEM) to traditional DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice disorder diagnosis via AI lacks transparency, limiting clinical trust. XAI offers interpretability without sacrificing performance.

Method: Focuses on concept-based models (CBM, CEM) to provide transparent explanations while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

Result: Concept-based models achieve performance comparable to traditional DNNs but with better interpretability.

Conclusion: XAI, particularly concept-based models, can enhance trust in AI-driven voice disorder diagnosis by balancing performance and transparency.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of positive sampling Kantorovich operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties, including local and global approximation using SK, Gaussian, Bilateral, and thresholding wavelet-based operators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the approximation properties and convergence of various sampling Kantorovich operators for image processing applications, particularly in non-ideal conditions where images have uneven characteristics.

Method: Introduced basic terminology and fundamental theorem of approximation (FTA) with various conditions for different operators. Measured error using MSE, speckle index (SI), speckle suppression index (SSI), speckle mean preservation index (SMPI), and equivalent number of looks (ENL) at different resolution levels. Used numerical examples including 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom from 3D images.

Result: Different operators showed varying performance for different image features due to the uneven nature of images in non-ideal conditions. Some operators worked well for specific features while others did not.

Conclusion: Various sampling Kantorovich operators have their own significance when studying different image features, with no single operator performing optimally for all features due to the non-uniform nature of real-world images.

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning framework for skeleton-based human activity recognition in industrial settings, showing significant improvements over centralized approaches while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate real-time worker action recognition in smart manufacturing while addressing privacy concerns in industrial scenarios where centralized data collection is impractical.

Method: Developed FL framework using custom skeletal dataset of 8 industrial upper-body gestures, processed with modified FastPose model. Evaluated LSTM and Transformer backbones under four paradigms: centralized, local, FL with FedAvg, and federated ensemble learning.

Result: FL Transformer improved over centralized training by +12.4pp on global test set, with FedEnsemble achieving +16.3pp gain. On unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceeded centralized accuracy by +52.6pp and +58.3pp respectively.

Conclusion: FL not only preserves privacy but significantly enhances cross-user generalization, making it a practical solution for scalable, privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial environments.

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

*Lianghui Zhu,Bin Ouyang,Yuxuan Zhang,Tianheng Cheng,Rui Hu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Xiaoxin Chen,Li Yu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS is a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes chain-of-thought reasoning and segmentation jointly, achieving state-of-the-art performance on text-prompted image segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning methods ignore explicit chain-of-thought reasoning at test time, limiting generalization to unseen prompts and domains.

Method: Scalable RL framework with unified rewards spanning sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues to generate informative CoT rationales while refining mask quality.

Result: Achieves 81.2% average cIoU on RefCOCO benchmarks, outperforming GLaMM by up to 5.6% using Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model.

Conclusion: RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers practical path toward more generalizable Segment Anything models.

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

Conclusion: RynnEC advances development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents and facilitates generalization across diverse embodied tasks, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,

### [5] [Local Scale Equivariance with Latent Deep Equilibrium Canonicalizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14187)
*Md Ashiqur Rahman,Chiao-An Yang,Michael N. Cheng,Lim Jun Hao,Jeremiah Jiang,Teck-Yian Lim,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) method improves local scale equivariance to handle object scale variations in computer vision, enhancing performance and scale consistency across popular pre-trained models like ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge where objects of the same class can have different sizes and perceived sizes affected by camera distance, requiring local scale handling within images.

Method: Deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) that can be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and adapted to pre-trained models to improve local scale equivariance.

Result: DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained deep-nets (ViT, DeiT, Swin, BEiT) on the competitive ImageNet benchmark.

Conclusion: DEC provides an effective solution for handling local scale variations in computer vision tasks and can be readily integrated into existing architectures to enhance scale equivariance.

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

### [6] [CLIPSym: Delving into Symmetry Detection with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14197)
*Tinghan Yang,Md Ashiqur Rahman,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPSym leverages CLIP's vision-language capabilities with a novel equivariant decoder and semantic-aware prompting to detect rotation and reflection symmetries, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is a fundamental geometric cue in computer vision, and recent advances in vision-language models like CLIP provide opportunities to leverage additional symmetry cues from natural image descriptions for improved detection.

Method: CLIPSym combines CLIP's image and language encoders with a rotation-equivariant decoder using Transformer and G-Convolution. Introduces Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG) to aggregate diverse object-based prompts for better semantic integration.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Ablation studies confirm benefits of CLIP pre-training, equivariant decoder, and SAPG technique.

Conclusion: The proposed CLIPSym framework successfully leverages vision-language pre-training and novel architectural components to achieve superior symmetry detection performance, demonstrating the value of semantic cues from language models for geometric tasks.

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at

*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel image classification framework combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams, using graph-based image representation with Delaunay triangulations for improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage GCNs' capability for handling relational data in image classification, moving beyond conventional CNNs by representing images as graphs with spatial relationships.

Method: Proposed normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN) that uses Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations to create graph representations where pixels/regions are vertices, enabling efficient relational modeling.

Result: Significant improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art models, especially for complex scenes and fine-grained categories.

Conclusion: Integration of GCNs with Voronoi diagrams shows strong potential for advancing image classification and opens new avenues for graph-based learning in computer vision and unstructured data domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

*Thanh-Dat Truong,Huu-Thien Tran,Tran Thai Son,Bhiksha Raj,Khoa Luu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel learning mechanism that improves multimodal model robustness through shuffling tasks and directed-token approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on LMM benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models suffer from robustness and generalization limitations due to alignment issues between visual and textual features, requiring better cross-modality alignment methods.

Method: Proposes reconstructing image and text order tasks during pre-training and fine-tuning, introduces directed-token approach for visual knowledge capture, and implements Image-to-Response Guided loss for improved visual understanding.

Result: The approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with prior LMMs on academic task-oriented and instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed shuffling-based learning mechanism effectively enhances reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment in large multimodal models.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

### [10] [Effect of Data Augmentation on Conformal Prediction for Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14266)
*Rizwan Ahamed,Annahita Amireskandari,Joel Palko,Carol Laxson,Binod Bhattarai,Prashnna Gyawali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Data augmentation strategies significantly impact conformal prediction performance for diabetic retinopathy grading, with sample-mixing methods (Mixup, CutMix) improving both accuracy and uncertainty reliability while CLAHE can negatively affect model certainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for medical tasks like diabetic retinopathy grading need reliable uncertainty quantification for clinical deployment, but the interaction between standard training practices like data augmentation and conformal prediction guarantees is not well understood.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five data augmentation strategies (no augmentation, geometric transforms, CLAHE, Mixup, CutMix) on two backbone architectures (ResNet-50, CoaT transformer) using the DDR dataset, analyzing conformal metrics including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct efficiency.

Result: Sample-mixing strategies (Mixup and CutMix) improve both predictive accuracy and yield more reliable/efficient uncertainty estimates, while CLAHE negatively impacts model certainty.

Conclusion: Augmentation strategies must be co-designed with downstream uncertainty quantification to build trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging, as different methods significantly affect conformal prediction performance.

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dental CBCT scans are crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, but generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained control remains challenging in medical image synthesis.

Method: Integrates wavelet-based denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus learning on relevant anatomical structures for 3D dental volume generation.

Result: Strong fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance, and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans across tasks like tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis.

Conclusion: Enables realistic, localized modification of dentition without rescanning, opening opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data augmentation in dental AI workflows.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GALA is a novel framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding using 3D Gaussian Splatting that learns language-aware 3D representations through self-supervised contrastive learning and cross-attention with codebooks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D scene reconstruction methods struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D representations from 2D images, limiting open-vocabulary understanding capabilities.

Method: GALA distills scene-specific 3D instance features via self-supervised contrastive learning and introduces a cross-attention module with two learnable codebooks to encode view-independent semantic embeddings, avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D tasks.

Conclusion: GALA provides an effective framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with reduced memory consumption and strong performance across 2D and 3D queries.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

### [13] [Multi-Rationale Explainable Object Recognition via Contrastive Conditional Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14280)
*Ali Rasekh,Sepehr Kazemi Ranjbar,Simon Gottschalk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark and contrastive conditional inference framework that improves CLIP-based object recognition with better rationale conditioning and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable object recognition methods using CLIP suffer from weak conditioning on explanatory structures and limited single/noisy rationales that don't capture the full diversity of discriminative image features.

Method: Proposes a contrastive conditional inference (CCI) framework that explicitly models probabilistic relationships among image embeddings, category labels, and rationales, enabling effective rationale conditioning without requiring training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-rationale benchmark with strong zero-shot performance, setting new standards for both classification accuracy and rationale quality.

Conclusion: Provides a more complete framework for evaluating future explainable object recognition models, with the benchmark and method offering comprehensive representation of the task.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

TL;DR: OccluNet is a spatio-temporal deep learning model that combines YOLOX object detection with transformer-based temporal attention to automatically detect vascular occlusions in DSA sequences for acute ischemic stroke treatment, significantly outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy is critical but challenging due to anatomical complexity and time constraints in interpreting digital subtraction angiography sequences.

Method: Proposes OccluNet which integrates YOLOX (single-stage object detector) with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms. Two variants were explored: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention. Compared against YOLOv11 baseline trained on individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections.

Result: Evaluation on DSA images from MR CLEAN Registry showed precision of 89.02% and recall of 74.87%. OccluNet significantly outperformed baseline models, with both attention variants achieving similar performance.

Conclusion: OccluNet demonstrates capability to capture temporally consistent features in DSA sequences and provides an effective automated solution for vascular occlusion detection in acute ischemic stroke treatment.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

*Yuguang Yue,Chris Green,Samuel Hunt,Irakli Salia,Wenzhe Shi,Jonathan J Hunt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixels2Play-0.1 is a foundation model that learns to play various 3D video games using pixel input only, trained with behavior cloning from human demonstrations and unlabeled videos, achieving competent gameplay across different titles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create AI agents that can serve as teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized streamers, and assistive testers by relying solely on pixel input like human players and generalizing to new games with minimal engineering.

Method: End-to-end behavior cloning using labeled human gameplay demonstrations and unlabeled public videos with action imputation via inverse-dynamics model. Uses decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output for large action space handling on consumer GPUs.

Result: Qualitative results show competent play across Roblox and classic MS-DOS games. Ablations demonstrate the value of unlabeled data. The model works latency-friendly on single consumer GPU.

Conclusion: P2P0.1 demonstrates promising foundation model capabilities for game playing, with scaling and evaluation steps outlined to achieve expert-level, text-conditioned control in future versions.

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

*Guile Wu,David Huang,Dongfeng Bai,Bingbing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified diffusion transformer model for multi-modal multi-view video generation in autonomous driving, capable of generating RGB, depth maps, and semantic maps simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation approaches focus only on RGB and lack multi-modal support, while multi-modal data (depth, semantic maps) is crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving.

Method: Constructs a unified diffusion transformer model with modal-shared and modal-specific components, using diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the approach generates high-fidelity multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with superior controllability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses multi-modal video generation for autonomous driving, outperforming existing methods and providing comprehensive scene understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

### [17] [Inter-Class Relational Loss for Small Object Detection: A Case Study on License Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343)
*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes inter-class relational loss to improve small object detection by leveraging spatial relationships between objects, achieving significant mAP improvements without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based losses fail to properly update gradients for small objects due to flat gradients, causing insufficient learning during multi-object training.

Method: Uses inter-class spatial relationships (e.g., license plate attached to car) to add loss punishment when predicted small objects are not within their associated larger objects, inversely proportional to overlapped area.

Result: Achieves 10.3% and 1.6% mAP50 improvements for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR respectively, with new SVMLP dataset for license plate detection.

Conclusion: ICR loss penalty can be easily integrated into existing IoU-based losses to enhance small object detection performance without additional hyperparameters.

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

*Sean Fletcher,Gabby Scott,Douglas Currie,Xin Zhang,Yuqi Song,Bruce MacLeod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New microscopy dataset and baseline model for automated detection of Taxol effects on cells using deep learning and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for monitoring Taxol effects require specialized equipment and are labor-intensive, lacking public datasets for automated morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure.

Method: Created a new microscopy image dataset of C6 glioma cells treated with varying Taxol concentrations, and developed ResAttention-KNN model combining ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and k-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

Result: Proposed baseline model integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to enhance robustness and interpretability for Taxol concentration classification.

Conclusion: Both dataset and implementation are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research in vision-based biomedical analysis of chemotherapeutic effects.

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

*Zhujun Li,Shuo Zhang,Ioannis Stamos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRC-Pose is a depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation that uses contrastive learning with a hierarchical ranking scheme to learn continuous pose representations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely solely on 6D pose supervision without capturing pose continuity, leading to prediction inconsistencies and poor generalization to unseen poses.

Method: Decouples pose into rotation/translation components, uses contrastive learning with 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking to learn continuous representations, and processes learned embeddings separately.

Result: Outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks, runs in real-time, and successfully learns continuous feature spaces.

Conclusion: HRC-Pose demonstrates effectiveness for real-world applications by addressing pose continuity through contrastive learning, achieving superior performance while maintaining real-time operation.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

*Ziqi Zhang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for emotion-controllable talking face generation that uses pre-training strategies to disentangle audio components and quantize videos into visual tokens, then employs an emotion-anchor representation and autoregressive transformer to synthesize emotional videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in modeling multimodal relationships for specific emotions and synthesizing identity-preserving emotional videos in talking face generation tasks.

Method: Uses two pre-training strategies to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into visual tokens. Proposes emotion-anchor representation to integrate emotional information, and employs an autoregressive transformer to model visual token distributions and predict index sequences for video synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on MEAD dataset demonstrate superior performance both qualitatively and quantitatively in emotion-controllable talking face generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses emotion-controllable talking face generation by discretely modeling multimodal relationships and synthesizing high-quality emotional videos while preserving identity.

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalized multi-object tracking framework that handles various object types with focus on vehicle tracking, featuring occlusion-aware re-ID and road-structure-aware refinement, achieving strong performance on both new benchmarks and conventional MOT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MOT systems are limited to pedestrian tracking and lack generalization to other object categories like vehicles in complex traffic scenes.

Method: Two key components: (1) occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism for identity preservation of occluded objects, (2) road-structure-aware tracklet refinement using semantic scene priors (lane directions, crosswalks, road boundaries).

Result: Achieves robust performance on new vehicle-focused benchmark and public benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking while maintaining strong performance on conventional benchmarks, providing a generalized solution beyond pedestrian tracking.

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

*Runshi Zhang,Bimeng Jie,Yang He,Junchen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCFNet is a Transformer-based coarse-to-fine network for accurate face-bone point cloud transformations in orthognathic surgical planning, addressing limitations of traditional biomechanical and existing deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional biomechanical simulation methods are computationally intensive and inaccurate, while existing deep learning approaches have limited receptive fields, noisy outputs, and require complex preprocessing/postprocessing operations, limiting their clinical applicability.

Method: Two-stage end-to-end framework: 1) Transformer-based network for global feature extraction, 2) Local Information Aggregation Network (LIA-Net) to model local geometric structures and compensate for Transformer's neighborhood precision loss. Uses gated recurrent unit and auxiliary loss inspired by deformable medical image registration.

Result: TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization results compared to state-of-the-art methods on gathered datasets, demonstrating superior performance in face-bone point cloud transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed TCFNet framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by combining global Transformer features with local geometric modeling, providing an accurate and efficient solution for computer-aided surgical simulation in orthognathic planning.

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

TL;DR: QuadINR introduces hardware-efficient implicit neural representations using piecewise quadratic activation functions to reduce spectral bias while dramatically cutting hardware costs compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to mitigate spectral bias in INRs used complex activation functions that incurred significant hardware overhead, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Proposes QuadINR with piecewise quadratic activation functions that provide rich harmonic content, analyzed through Neural Tangent Kernel theory, and implements a unified N-stage pipeline framework for efficient hardware deployment on FPGA and ASIC platforms.

Result: Achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior work with only 1914μm² area and 6.14mW dynamic power, reducing resource consumption by 97% and latency by 93% across image and video experiments.

Conclusion: QuadINR demonstrates that piecewise quadratic activation functions can provide superior performance with dramatically reduced hardware overhead, making INRs more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Img2ST-Net is a novel framework that uses a fully convolutional architecture to generate high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data from histology images in parallel, addressing computational challenges of conventional spot-by-spot methods and introducing SSIM-ST metric for sparse expression evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics data acquisition is expensive and time-consuming. Conventional sequential regression frameworks become inefficient and unstable at high resolutions (8um or finer), and the extreme sparsity of high-resolution ST data complicates both prediction and evaluation.

Method: Proposes Img2ST-Net with a fully convolutional architecture that generates dense HD gene expression maps in parallel. Reformulates the task as super-content image generation by modeling HD ST data as super-pixel representations with hundreds/thousands of output channels. Introduces SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric for high-resolution ST analysis.

Result: The framework improves computational efficiency while better preserving spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. Provides a scalable, biologically coherent solution for high-resolution ST prediction that is robust to sparse expression patterns.

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net offers a principled solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale, laying groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and resolution-aware. The source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and

### [26] [CTA-Flux: Integrating Chinese Cultural Semantics into High-Quality English Text-to-Image Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14405)
*Yue Gong,Shanyuan Liu,Liuzhuozheng Li,Jian Zhu,Bo Cheng,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Yuhang Ma,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CTA-Flux is a Chinese text adapter that enables Flux (an English-trained text-to-image model) to understand and generate culturally authentic Chinese images by leveraging MultiModal Diffusion Transformer architecture, reducing parameters while maintaining compatibility with existing plugins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux performs poorly with non-English prompts due to linguistic and cultural biases in English-centric training. Existing translation or finetuning approaches fail to capture culturally specific semantics, compromising image authenticity.

Method: Uses MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to directly control the Flux backbone, enabling Chinese semantic understanding without massive parameter scaling like ControlNet architectures.

Result: Empirical evaluations show CTA-flux supports both Chinese and English prompts, achieving superior image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Conclusion: CTA-flux effectively bridges Chinese semantic understanding with English-centric TTI models, improving cultural authenticity without extensive retraining while maintaining plugin compatibility.

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

*Jeahun Sung,Changhyun Roh,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCHA-former is a novel transformer-based model that effectively removes moiré patterns from camera-captured screen content by addressing spatial variation, large-scale structures, channel dependence, and temporal fluctuations through decoupled moiré adaptation and spatio-temporal adaptive processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based screen capture suffers from moiré patterns caused by frequency aliasing between camera CFA and display sub-pixels, degrading photo/video quality. Existing demoiréing methods fail to handle spatially varying artifacts, large-scale structures, channel-dependent statistics, and temporal fluctuations across frames.

Method: MoCHA-former uses two main components: Decoupled Moiré Adaptive Demoiréing (DMAD) with Moiré Decoupling Block and Detail Decoupling Block to separate moiré/content, and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoiréing (STAD) with Spatial Fusion Block and Feature Channel Attention. It performs implicit frame alignment without explicit modules.

Result: The model consistently outperforms prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics on two video datasets covering both RAW and sRGB domains, demonstrating superior moiré removal performance.

Conclusion: MoCHA-former effectively addresses key limitations in moiré pattern removal through its hybrid adaptive transformer architecture, providing state-of-the-art performance for both spatial and temporal moiré artifact reduction in screen capture scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

TL;DR: HyperDiff combines diffusion models with HyperGCN for monocular 3D human pose estimation, addressing depth ambiguity and occlusion while capturing multi-scale skeleton features through multi-granularity structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monocular 3D HPE methods suffer from depth ambiguity, occlusion issues, and often overlook multi-scale skeleton features during 2D-to-3D lifting, which reduces pose estimation accuracy.

Method: Proposes HyperDiff method integrating diffusion models with HyperGCN. Diffusion model captures data uncertainty to handle depth ambiguity and occlusion, while HyperGCN serves as denoiser using multi-granularity structures to model high-order joint correlations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. The method flexibly adapts to varying computational resources to balance performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperDiff effectively addresses key challenges in monocular 3D pose estimation by combining diffusion models' uncertainty handling with HyperGCN's multi-scale feature modeling, demonstrating superior performance and computational flexibility.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

*Gabriel Tjio,Jie Zhang,Xulei Yang,Yun Xing,Nhat Chung,Xiaofeng Cao,Ivor W. Tsang,Chee Keong Kwoh,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a frequency-based conditioning approach using diffusion models to preserve task-relevant knowledge during test-time adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 15 corruption types and three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of balancing knowledge preservation and domain adaptation in test-time adaptation, where adapting to domain shifts can cause forgetting of task-relevant knowledge.

Method: Proposes FOCUS - a frequency-based conditioning approach within a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Uses a Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) to disentangle high/low frequency information from noisy images, trained with FrequencyMix data augmentation. Conditions reverse diffusion steps to preserve semantic information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art averaged performance for semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets. Also complements existing model adaptation methods by providing pseudo labels from denoised images.

Conclusion: FOCUS effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in model adaptation, preserves task-relevant knowledge during domain shifts, and can be integrated with existing adaptation methods for improved performance with limited supervision.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle with multi-subject compositional synthesis that requires both precise spatial control and faithful reconstruction of reference subjects in specified regions.

Method: Proposes concatenated cross-attention (CCA) mechanism for bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and text, plus a progressive two-stage training strategy that decomposes the task into learnable sub-objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments show MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: MUSE advances the frontier of controllable image synthesis by successfully addressing the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity preservation in multi-subject compositional tasks.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: Multimodal integration with NIR data and text metadata significantly enhances agricultural 3D reconstruction robustness and provides botanical insights beyond visible spectrum.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer interaction, but current methods suffer from poor generalizability across diverse domains and difficulty modeling complex interaction dynamics.

Method: Proposes DAPA framework with Domain Prompting mechanism (learnable domain-specific vectors) and Parallel Cross-Attention module that aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM) states between participants.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-cultural and cross-linguistic benchmarks, with 0.45 absolute improvement in CCC on NoXi-J test set. Won first place in Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at MultiMediate'25.

Conclusion: DAPA effectively addresses domain generalization challenges in engagement estimation through explicit domain conditioning and interaction synchrony modeling, demonstrating superior performance across diverse domains.

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D^3-Talker is a novel 3D talking head synthesis method that uses static 3D Gaussian attribute fields with separate audio and facial motion deformation fields to achieve better lip sync and image quality with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D talking head synthesis methods require extensive training videos per identity and struggle with poor lip synchronization when trained on few frames due to audio containing irrelevant information to lip motion.

Method: Constructs static 3D Gaussian attribute field with separate audio and facial motion deformation fields, uses similarity contrastive loss for decoupling, and integrates coarse-to-fine module for image refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization with limited training data.

Conclusion: D^3-Talker effectively decouples general and personalized deformations, achieving superior performance in 3D talking head synthesis with minimal training requirements.

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for customized video editing is growing rapidly, but current subject swapping approaches are either domain-specific or rely on indirect editing methods that compromise fidelity. There's a need for a general-purpose, high-fidelity video subject swapping solution.

Method: Proposes DreamSwapV - a mask-guided, subject-agnostic end-to-end framework with multiple conditions and a dedicated condition fusion module. Uses an adaptive mask strategy to handle varying subject scales and attributes. Employs a two-phase dataset construction and training scheme.

Result: Outperforms existing methods as validated by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and the newly introduced DreamSwapV-Benchmark. Achieves superior subject swapping fidelity and contextual integration.

Conclusion: DreamSwapV provides an effective solution for customized video subject swapping that works across diverse domains and maintains high fidelity through advanced condition integration and adaptive masking techniques.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric

assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active

Result: Extensive experiments show Vivid-VR outperforms existing approaches on synthetic, real-world benchmarks, and AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness, and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses distribution drift issues in video restoration, providing state-of-the-art performance with publicly available code and checkpoints.

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,

Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with capturing complex layouts and object relationships from prompts, while existing graph-guided approaches rely on heavy GAN/diffusion pipelines that lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in speed and quality.

Method: SATURN extends VAR-CLIP by translating scene graphs into salience-ordered token sequences, allowing a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while only fine-tuning the VAR transformer.

Result: On Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming prior methods like SG2IM and SGDiff without extra modules or multi-stage training.

Conclusion: SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity, showing significant improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous

Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from

Conclusion: PB-IAD provides a user-centric, flexible solution for industrial anomaly detection that eliminates the need for data science expertise and extensive annotated datasets while maintaining high performance across diverse manufacturing scenarios and data modalities.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure

framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

*Jiangfan Liu,Yongkang Guo,Fangzhi Zhong,Tianyuan Zhang,Zonglei Jing,Siyuan Liang,Jiakai Wang,Mingchuan Zhang,Aishan Liu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenGE is a framework that uses LLMs to generate diverse safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing by creating plausible adversarial agents and amplifying threats with complex traffic flows, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 31.96% in collision detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluation methods for autonomous vehicles rely on predefined threat patterns and rule-based strategies, which fail to expose diverse and unforeseen failure modes, limiting comprehensive safety assessment before real-world deployment.

Method: ScenGE uses Meta-Scenario Generation where an LLM grounded in driving knowledge infers plausible adversarial agents, then Complex Scenario Evolution amplifies threats using background vehicles and adversarial collaborator graphs to optimize trajectories that reduce maneuvering space and create critical occlusions.

Result: Extensive experiments show ScenGE uncovers 31.96% more severe collision cases than state-of-the-art baselines, works with different simulators and AV systems, improves model robustness through adversarial training, and generates scenarios validated as plausible and critical through real-world tests and human evaluation.

Conclusion: ScenGE represents a critical advancement in autonomous vehicle safety testing by generating diverse, plausible safety-critical scenarios that can build public trust and ensure safer deployment of autonomous vehicles in society.

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

*Yonghan Shin,SeungKyu Kim,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE is an adaptive whole slide image encoding framework that uses vision-language models to selectively process only diagnostically relevant regions, reducing encoding time by 3x while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images in computational pathology require processing tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per slide, resulting in prohibitive encoding costs and preprocessing times that extend to days or weeks, making WSI encoding the major bottleneck in real-world deployment.

Method: WISE-FUSE leverages pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to compute similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions using knowledge distillation. It selects a small subset of informative regions based on these scores, quickly eliminates irrelevant patches at coarse level, and then selectively encodes corresponding high-resolution patches fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch processing.

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE offers a scalable and practical solution for computational pathology by addressing the significant bottleneck of WSI encoding through selective processing of diagnostically relevant regions.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

TL;DR: Unsupervised OCR correction method using document character redundancy with extended GMM and EM algorithm to improve recognition of low-quality documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCR systems struggle with low-quality data and high inter-domain variability in printed documents, failing to exploit document redundancy for better character recognition.

Method: Extended Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation-Maximization algorithm, intra-cluster realignment process, and normality statistical testing to leverage character shape redundancy within documents.

Result: Demonstrated improvements on degraded documents including Uruguayan military archives and 17th-20th century European newspapers.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised method effectively corrects imperfect OCR outputs by utilizing document-specific character redundancy, showing promise for historical and degraded document processing.

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

*Sukhyun Jeong,Hong-Gi Shin,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to enhance controllable motion generation by augmenting discrete pose codes with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization, improving both motion quality and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained motion details, limiting expressiveness in controllable motion generation systems.

Method: Augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization (RVQ) to preserve interpretability while capturing subtle motion characteristics.

Result: On HumanML3D dataset: reduces FID from 0.041 to 0.015, improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510. Qualitative analysis confirms improved controllability for motion editing.

Conclusion: The proposed RVQ-based approach successfully enhances motion generation quality while maintaining the interpretability and manipulability of pose codes for intuitive control.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

*Sujin Jeon,Hyundo Lee,Eungseo Kim,Sanghack Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCBM improves concept bottleneck models by using prototype learning to ensure accurate spatial localization of concepts, addressing issues where previous models attended to irrelevant regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing label-free concept bottleneck models often fail to properly localize concepts in relevant image regions, attending to visually unrelated areas when predicting concept presence.

Method: Uses prototype learning with one prototype per concept, promoted to represent prototypical image features. Leverages foundation models to ensure prototype relevance and facilitates learning proper local regions for concept prediction.

Result: LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in images and exhibits improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Conclusion: The proposed LCBM framework successfully addresses localization issues in concept bottleneck models by utilizing prototype learning and foundation model information.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOGS is a two-stage inverse rendering framework using 2D Gaussian surfels that addresses limitations in glossy object reconstruction by combining physics-based rendering with geometric priors and Monte Carlo sampling for accurate material decomposition and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NeRF-based methods are computationally expensive while 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with specular reflections, causing surface noise and poor material property estimation in glossy object reconstruction.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Robust surface reconstruction using physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation and geometric priors from foundation models; 2) Material decomposition via Monte Carlo importance sampling, differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing for indirect illumination, and spherical mipmap-based directional encoding for anisotropic highlights.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.

Conclusion: GOGS effectively addresses the fundamental ambiguity in inverse rendering of glossy objects by combining efficient surface reconstruction with accurate material modeling, enabling high-quality results for geometry, materials, and relighting applications.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Conclusion: Provides valuable real-world accident dataset and effective hybrid detection model, with data and code publicly available for research community.

Abstract: Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety
of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be
understood as an unavoidable and sporadic outcome of traffic networks. We
present the TUM Traffic Accident (TUMTraf-A) dataset, a collection of
real-world highway accidents. It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at
high-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and

TL;DR: HistAug is a generative model for controllable latent space augmentations in digital pathology that efficiently generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving semantic information, improving MIL model performance especially in low-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide image analysis faces challenges due to gigapixel resolution and scarce supervision. Traditional patch-level augmentation is computationally expensive, while existing feature-level methods lack transformation control, creating a need for efficient and controllable augmentation techniques.

Method: HistAug uses a generative model conditioned on explicit patch-level transformations (hue, erosion, etc.) to generate realistic augmented embeddings in latent space. It processes large numbers of patches efficiently in a single forward pass while preserving semantic information.

Result: HistAug outperforms existing methods across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm benefits over noise-based perturbations and highlight importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

Conclusion: HistAug provides an efficient and effective solution for data augmentation in digital pathology, enabling robust MIL model training with improved performance, especially when training data is limited, while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

TL;DR: A novel two-phase uncertainty-aware transformer framework for robust smoke detection using optical flow-based motion encoding and appearance fusion, achieving superior performance in early fire warning systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire outbreaks require reliable early detection, but smoke plumes have complex spatiotemporal dynamics affected by illumination changes, flow kinematics, and environmental noise that challenge traditional detectors.

Method: Proposes a Two-Phase Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer that integrates optical flow estimation (using a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set fractional-order variational model) with appearance cues via Gaussian Mixture Model. Uses a two-phase learning regimen: first optimizes detection accuracy, then learns to estimate prediction confidence by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and autonomous monitoring applications without requiring complex multi-sensor arrays.

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

TL;DR: Visual prompt-based methods underperform in incremental object detection compared to image classification, but combining prompts with small data replay achieves best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the generalizability of visual prompt-based methods from incremental image classification to incremental object detection, as no prior work has applied them to IOD.

Method: Analyzed three different prompt-based methods under complex domain-incremental learning setting with various reference baselines. Tested prompt length and initialization variations.

Result: Prompt-based approaches underperformed in IOD setting. However, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data achieved the best performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide valuable insights for advancing prompt-based incremental learning in object detection, showing limitations of pure prompt methods but promising results when combined with data replay.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

TL;DR: UST-SSM extends Selective State Space Models to point cloud videos by addressing spatio-temporal disorder through semantic-aware sequence reorganization and feature compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud videos are effective for recognizing subtle human actions but suffer from spatio-temporal disorder that hinders unidirectional modeling when directly converted to 1D sequences.

Method: Proposes Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model with Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS) for semantic-aware sequence reorganization, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) for feature compensation, and Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) for enhanced temporal dependencies.

Result: Experimental validation on MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: UST-SSM successfully addresses the challenges of modeling point cloud videos with spatio-temporal disorder, enabling effective utilization of spatially and temporally distant yet similar points through semantic-aware sequence organization.

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While SNNs show promise for low-power computation, their application in visual tasks has been limited to basic tasks like image classification. The potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks like multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos remains underexplored.

Method: Proposes SMTrack with an adaptive scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss that dynamically adjusts normalization based on average object size per batch to improve small object detection. Incorporates TrackTrack identity module for robust trajectory maintenance.

Result: Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets show SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods.

Conclusion: SMTrack advances robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios, demonstrating the viability of directly-trained SNNs for sophisticated temporal vision tasks on conventional RGB video streams.

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

Motivation: Existing video editing methods struggle with structural drift and temporal artifacts in long videos, making it challenging to maintain global consistency and temporal coherence across minute-long sequences.

Method: Decouples long video editing into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth intermediate frame interpolation, using progressive denoising for structural consistency and multimodal guidance for temporal dynamics preservation.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchorSync produces coherent, high-fidelity edits that surpass prior methods in both visual quality and temporal stability.

Conclusion: AnchorSync effectively addresses the challenges of long video editing by maintaining structural consistency and temporal coherence through its novel diffusion-based framework with anchor frame editing and interpolation.

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

### [55] [Towards PerSense++: Advancing Training-Free Personalized Instance Segmentation in Dense Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14660)
*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Umer Sheikh,Hassan Abid,Kevin Henry,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PerSense++ is a training-free one-shot segmentation framework for dense images that uses density maps, adaptive thresholding, and feedback mechanisms to handle occlusions and clutter, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation in dense visual scenes is challenging due to occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations, requiring specialized approaches for personalized instance segmentation.

Method: Uses Instance Detection Module with density maps for candidate prompts, Point Prompt Selection Module with adaptive thresholding, feedback mechanism for exemplar selection, and enhanced with diversity-aware selection, hybrid IDM, and Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module.

Result: Extensive experiments show PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses dense scene segmentation challenges through training-free, model-agnostic approach with specialized components for handling complex density patterns and clutter.

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

### [56] [GeMS: Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Extreme Motion Blur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14682)
*Gopi Raju Matta,Trisha Reddypalli,Vemunuri Divya Madhuri,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS is a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that handles severely motion-blurred images without requiring sharp reference images, using deep learning-based SfM and probabilistic scene initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume access to sharp images for camera pose estimation and point cloud generation, which is unrealistic for severely blurred inputs. COLMAP-based approaches fail due to unreliable feature correspondences under extreme blur.

Method: GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM for pose estimation and point cloud generation from blurred inputs, (2) 3DGS-MCMC treating Gaussians as probability samples for robust initialization, and (3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters. GeMS-E adds event-based EDI deblurring for progressive refinement.

Result: Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets with severely blurred inputs.

Conclusion: This is the first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from severely blurred images, eliminating the need for sharp reference images.

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

### [57] [Seeing Further on the Shoulders of Giants: Knowledge Inheritance for Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14707)
*Jiabo Huang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-driven approach that unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to build a general-purpose vision foundation model without requiring large-scale labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models rely on data-centric methods requiring massive labeled datasets and high-end GPUs, which are inaccessible to most institutions. Many domain-specific pre-trained models exist but remain underutilized for general-purpose VFM development.

Method: Joint knowledge transfer and preservation approach that unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate distributional gaps, with a knowledge preservation strategy using a general-purpose teacher as knowledge base and adapters for purpose-specific teachers.

Result: The developed VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks: image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Conclusion: This model-driven approach successfully builds powerful vision foundation models by unifying and aggregating existing pre-trained models, inheriting teachers' expertise without needing large labeled datasets, while providing generalizable features and supporting multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSFix3D improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by integrating diffusion model knowledge to enhance novel view synthesis and repair missing regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in 3D Gaussian Splatting for extreme viewpoints and partial observations, and overcome diffusion models' lack of scene awareness for accurate 3D reconstruction.

Method: Introduces GSFixer, a latent diffusion model fine-tuned to leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians, with random mask augmentation for plausible inpainting of missing regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks, requires minimal scene-specific fine-tuning, and demonstrates resilience to pose errors in real-world tests.

Conclusion: GSFix3D successfully bridges diffusion model generative capabilities with 3D scene consistency, enabling robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses with high visual fidelity.

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Motivation: To explore the societal transformation from AI and robotics progress, studying how humans and robots can coexist in shared communities with both opportunities and challenges.

Method: Developed an open-source multi-agent physics simulator with real-world aligned community generation, including outdoor spaces, indoor scenes, and grounded agents with rich characters. Proposed two challenges: Community Planning Challenge for multi-agent reasoning and Community Robot Challenge for heterogeneous robot collaboration.

Result: The platform enables evaluation of various baselines, demonstrating challenges in both high-level open-world task planning and low-level cooperation controls for human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: Virtual Community provides a foundation for further research on human-robot coexistence in open-world environments, addressing both social intelligence and practical cooperation challenges.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety challenges in autonomous driving by detecting unknown objects and handling unforeseen scenarios, overcoming limitations of class-dependent segmentation and computationally expensive visual grounding methods.

Method: Multiscale video transformer with multi-stage query-memory decoding and scale-specific random drop-token mechanism. Uses shared learnable memory module to preserve high-resolution spatiotemporal features without feature compression.

Result: Outperforms multiscale baselines on DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets while maintaining efficiency in GPU memory and run-time.

Conclusion: Demonstrates promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical robotics applications through efficient motion-based object detection.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

### [61] [Improved Mapping Between Illuminations and Sensors for RAW Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14730)
*Abhijith Punnappurath,Luxi Zhao,Hoang Le,Abdelrahman Abdelhamed,SaiKiran Kumar Tedla,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dataset and neural network approach for RAW image illumination and sensor mapping to reduce data capture burden for deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW images have sensor-specific RGB values and strong color casts from scene illumination, making it challenging to capture comprehensive datasets for each sensor and illumination condition.

Method: Created a first-of-its-kind dataset using a customized lightbox with tunable illumination spectra to capture scenes under 390 illuminations with four cameras across 18 scenes, then developed a lightweight neural network for illumination and sensor mapping.

Result: The proposed neural network approach outperforms competing methods and demonstrates utility in training neural ISP systems.

Conclusion: The dataset and mapping method provide an effective solution for reducing the data capture burden in RAW image processing, enabling better deep learning performance across different sensors and illumination conditions.

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

*Fabian Holst,Emre Gülsoylu,Simone Frintrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel technique fuses monocular RGB images with AIS data to create 6D pose estimation datasets for marine vessels, achieving high accuracy without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of relying purely on AIS data for vessel location due to equipment reliability issues, data manipulation, and transmission delays.

Method: Combines vessel detections from monocular RGB images (using YOLOX-X object detection) with AIS messages to generate 3D bounding boxes representing 6D poses. Compares homography and Perspective-n-Point transformation methods for data alignment.

Result: Perspective-n-Point method achieves significantly lower projection error than homography. YOLOX-X achieves 0.80 mAP at IoU 0.5. Created BONK-pose dataset with 3753 images and 3D bounding box annotations.

Conclusion: The approach enables creation of 6D pose estimation datasets without manual annotation and provides publicly available datasets for training and evaluation of pose estimation networks.

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

*Zhichao Li,Arren Glover,Chiara Bartolozzi,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combines event camera optical flow with RGB-based pose estimation for high-speed 6-DoF object tracking, leveraging both sensor types' advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed object tracking is challenging due to frame rate limitations and motion blur in conventional cameras. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but lack rich visual information, while RGB cameras provide better single-shot pose estimation but suffer from motion issues at high speeds.

Method: Proposes an event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement a 6-DoF velocity tracker. Integrates this velocity data with low-frequency pose estimates from an RGB-based global pose estimator to enable high-speed tracking.

Result: The algorithm was tested and validated on both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating effectiveness particularly in high-speed motion scenarios.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully exploits the complementary strengths of event cameras (high temporal resolution) and RGB cameras (rich visual information) for robust 6-DoF pose tracking of high-speed objects.

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study on hospital domain bias in pathology foundation models, proposing adversarial framework to remove hospital-specific features while maintaining disease classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology foundation models may learn hospital-specific features due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing styles across hospitals, posing risks for clinical deployment.

Method: Propose lightweight adversarial framework with trainable adapter and domain classifier connected through gradient reversal layer (GRL) to remove latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying encoder.

Result: Method substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or improving disease classification performance, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. Hospital detection and feature space visualization confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed adversarial framework successfully mitigates hospital bias in pathology foundation models, enabling more robust clinical deployment across different hospital settings.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF-LPR² is a multi-frame license plate restoration framework that uses optical flow and spatio-temporal consistency to enhance low-quality dash cam images, achieving superior restoration and recognition performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: License plate recognition in dash cam images is challenging due to low resolution, motion blur, and glare. Existing generative models relying on pretrained priors often introduce artifacts and cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images.

Method: Proposed MF-LPR² framework that aligns and aggregates neighboring frames using state-of-the-art optical flow estimator with algorithms to detect/correct erroneous flow estimations by leveraging spatio-temporal consistency in license plate sequences. Created RLPR dataset with 200 pairs of low-quality sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth.

Result: Outperformed 8 restoration models in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS by significant margins. Achieved 86.44% recognition accuracy, beating best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among 11 baseline models. Ablation studies confirmed filtering/refinement algorithms' significant contributions.

Conclusion: MF-LPR² effectively addresses license plate restoration challenges by leveraging multi-frame alignment and spatio-temporal consistency instead of relying on pretrained priors, achieving both superior image quality enhancement and recognition accuracy while preserving evidential content.

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

Motivation: Overcome limitations of learning-based methods that require large training datasets, which constrains clinical adoption of medical image registration.

Method: Proposes a training-free pipeline using a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of deformation field in feature space.

Result: Achieved best mean Dice score (0.790) on Abdomen MR-CT with lowest HD95 (4.9±5.0) and SDLogJ (0.08±0.02). On ACDC cardiac MRI, improved mean DSC to 0.769 and reduced SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8.

Conclusion: Operating in compact foundation feature space at test time offers practical and general solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tinker is a zero-shot 3D editing framework that enables high-fidelity multi-view consistent edits from just 1-2 images without per-scene optimization, using pretrained diffusion models and novel components for reference-driven editing and view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior 3D editing methods require extensive per-scene optimization or dozens of consistent input views, creating significant barriers to scalable 3D content creation. There's a need for generalizable editing that works across diverse scenes without scene-specific training.

Method: Repurposes pretrained diffusion models for latent 3D awareness. Uses two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor for precise reference-driven edits with cross-view coherence, and (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer that leverages video diffusion priors for scene completion and novel-view generation from sparse inputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. Significantly reduces barriers to generalizable 3D content creation with robust multi-view consistent edits from minimal input.

Conclusion: Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing by eliminating per-scene finetuning requirements and enabling high-quality editing from sparse inputs, making 3D content creation more accessible.

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

*Haoyu Zhao,Jiaxi Gu,Shicong Wang,Xing Zhang,Hang Xu,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for video-language retrieval that uses fine-grained feature learning and an inference pipeline to improve performance without additional training, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of high computational demands in existing video retrieval methods and the underexplored fine-grained information in videos and texts, while reducing training costs.

Method: Coarse-to-fine objectives with contrastive and matching learning, Granularity-Aware Representation module for fine-grained data, and an inference pipeline with voting mechanism and Matching Entropy metric leveraging keyword repetition.

Result: Outperforms previous approaches on four benchmarks, with inference pipeline achieving 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on MSR-VTT and 1.6% increase on DiDeMo dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves video-language retrieval performance through fine-grained feature learning and a novel inference strategy without requiring additional pre-training, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

*Zongming Li,Lianghui Zhu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransLight is a novel framework that enables high-fidelity transfer of complex light effects between images using generative decoupling and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing illumination-editing approaches fail to provide customized light control while preserving content integrity, making them ineffective for practical lighting stylization tasks.

Method: Uses generative decoupling with two fine-tuned diffusion models to separate image content and light effects, creating a million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Employs IC-Light as generative model with reference lighting as additional conditioning.

Result: Successfully transfers light effects across disparate images with high fidelity and flexible illumination control, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: TransLight establishes a new benchmark for illumination transfer, enabling customized natural light effects and charting new directions for illumination harmonization research.

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventSSEG is a novel event-only computing method for road segmentation that uses probabilistic attention and self-supervised learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles but challenging with frame-based cameras due to latency and compute requirements. Event cameras offer low-power sensing but face challenges in transferring pretrained weights and lack of labeled event data.

Method: EventSSEG uses event-only computing with a probabilistic attention mechanism and employs event-based self-supervised learning to eliminate the need for extensive labeled data.

Result: Experiments on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17 datasets show EventSSEG achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled events.

Conclusion: This approach successfully maximizes event cameras' capabilities while addressing the critical challenge of limited labeled event data for road segmentation.

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study establishes normative pancreas size/shape aging trends from 0-90 years using AI-based measurements on CT/MRI scans, finding significant morphological differences in type 2 diabetes patients compared to controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding pancreatic changes is crucial for detecting deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic diseases. Need reliable clinical imaging modalities and normative aging trends to identify pathological changes.

Method: Analyzed 2533 abdominal CT/MRI scans, resampled to 3mm resolution, used automated pancreas segmentation to extract 13 morphological features. Compared CT vs MRI measurements, established normative patterns by age/sex, and used GAMLSS regression on 1350 age/sex-matched patients (675 controls, 675 diabetes) to identify diabetes-related deviations.

Result: 10 of 13 morphological features showed significantly different aging trends in type 2 diabetes patients vs controls (p<0.05 after multiple comparisons correction). MRI yielded different measurements than CT. Pancreas was smaller in type 2 diabetes.

Conclusion: Provides lifespan pancreas morphology trends showing altered size/shape in type 2 diabetes. Establishes reference for normative pancreatic aging from large non-diabetic cohort. Reinforces that pancreas is smaller in diabetes patients.

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

*Mert Kiray,Alvaro Ritter,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-CLR is a self-supervised framework that aligns pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions from the same sequence to learn more generalizable features for action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods rely on single skeleton conventions, limiting generalization across datasets with diverse joint structures and anatomical coverage.

Method: Proposes Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning (MS-CLR) that aligns representations across multiple skeleton conventions from the same sequence, using an adapted ST-GCN architecture with unified representation for varying joint layouts.

Result: MS-CLR consistently outperforms single-skeleton contrastive learning baselines on NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets, with multi-skeleton ensemble achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Aligning representations across multiple skeleton conventions enables learning structural invariances and diverse anatomical cues, leading to more expressive and generalizable features for action recognition.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

*Licheng Shen,Saining Zhang,Honghan Li,Peilin Yang,Zihao Huang,Zongzheng Zhang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified method using articulated 3D Gaussians to jointly model geometry and motion of complex articulated objects, outperforming previous approaches and supporting up to 20 parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods decouple geometry and motion reconstruction, complicating pipelines and limiting scalability for objects with complex multi-part articulation.

Method: Introduces a unified representation using articulated 3D Gaussians that jointly models geometry and motion, improving robustness in motion decomposition.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry reconstruction and motion estimation, supporting objects with up to 20 parts (vs 2-3 parts in prior methods).

Conclusion: Demonstrates applicability to robotic simulation and human-scene interaction, highlighting the potential of unified articulated representations for scalable physical modeling.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

*Mattson Ogg,Chace Ashcraft,Ritwik Bose,Raphael Norman-Tenazas,Michael Wolmetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4o show strong alignment with human emotional ratings for words and images, particularly for happiness and categorical emotions, but show differences in arousal ratings and greater homogeneity compared to human responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how large language models evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli and situations, which is crucial for determining their effectiveness in roles involving human interaction and emotional understanding.

Method: Elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images previously rated by humans for emotional content, comparing responses across modalities and rating scales.

Result: GPT-4o responded very similarly to human participants (r = 0.9+ in many cases), with best alignment for happiness ratings and five-category emotion framework, but poorer alignment for arousal ratings and greater homogeneity than human ratings.

Conclusion: LLMs interpret emotional stimuli with significant but incomplete alignment to human responses, highlighting both similarities and differences between biological and artificial intelligence in emotional evaluation domains.

Abstract: Emotions exert an immense influence over human behavior and cognition in both
commonplace and high-stress tasks. Discussions of whether or how to integrate
large language models (LLMs) into everyday life (e.g., acting as proxies for,
or interacting with, human agents), should be informed by an understanding of
how these tools evaluate emotionally loaded stimuli or situations. A model's
alignment with human behavior in these cases can inform the effectiveness of
LLMs for certain roles or interactions. To help build this understanding, we
elicited ratings from multiple popular LLMs for datasets of words and images
that were previously rated for their emotional content by humans. We found that
when performing the same rating tasks, GPT-4o responded very similarly to human
participants across modalities, stimuli and most rating scales (r = 0.9 or
higher in many cases). However, arousal ratings were less well aligned between
human and LLM raters, while happiness ratings were most highly aligned. Overall
LLMs aligned better within a five-category (happiness, anger, sadness, fear,
disgust) emotion framework than within a two-dimensional (arousal and valence)
organization. Finally, LLM ratings were substantially more homogenous than
human ratings. Together these results begin to describe how LLM agents
interpret emotional stimuli and highlight similarities and differences among
biological and artificial intelligence in key behavioral domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a flexible explanation system that leverages both the logical precision of decision procedures and the natural language/visual capabilities of LLMs for complex decision sequences.

Method: Combines SAT solvers for generating short resolution proofs of local constraints with LLMs for visual explanations of connectivity constraints in Hitori puzzles.

Result: Implemented a tool that effectively assists humans in solving Hitori puzzles, with experimental evidence demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The neurosymbolic approach successfully integrates different explanation modalities (logical proofs and visual explanations) for comprehensive understanding of complex decision sequences.

Abstract: We propose a neurosymbolic approach to the explanation of complex sequences
of decisions that combines the strengths of decision procedures and Large
Language Models (LLMs). We demonstrate this approach by producing explanations
for the solutions of Hitori puzzles. The rules of Hitori include local
constraints that are effectively explained by short resolution proofs. However,
they also include a connectivity constraint that is more suitable for visual
explanations. Hence, Hitori provides an excellent testing ground for a flexible
combination of SAT solvers and LLMs. We have implemented a tool that assists
humans in solving Hitori puzzles, and we present experimental evidence of its
effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for optimization modeling suffer from high error rates (up to 42%), narrow evaluation scope, and computational inefficiency, requiring heavy reliance on experts.

Method: Enhanced datasets through systematic error correction, introduced LogiOR benchmark for logistics problems, and developed ORThought framework using chain-of-thought reasoning based on expert optimization principles.

Result: ORThought outperforms existing approaches including multi-agent frameworks, showing significant advantages on complex optimization problems.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights for future LLM-based optimization modeling research, with systematic analysis identifying critical success factors and failure modes.

Abstract: Optimization Modeling (OM) is essential for solving complex decision-making
problems. However, the process remains time-consuming and error-prone, heavily
relying on domain experts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in
addressing these challenges through their natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, current approaches face three critical limitations:
high benchmark labeling error rates reaching up to 42\%, narrow evaluation
scope that only considers optimal values, and computational inefficiency due to
heavy reliance on multi-agent systems or model fine-tuning. In this work, we
first enhance existing datasets through systematic error correction and more
comprehensive annotation. Additionally, we introduce LogiOR, a new optimization
modeling benchmark from the logistics domain, containing more complex problems
with standardized annotations. Furthermore, we present ORThought, a novel
framework that leverages expert-level optimization modeling principles through
chain-of-thought reasoning to automate the OM process. Through extensive
empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that ORThought outperforms existing
approaches, including multi-agent frameworks, with particularly significant
advantages on complex optimization problems. Finally, we provide a systematic

Motivation: AI agents increasingly mimic human behavior in networked environments, creating challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, and security due to difficulties in supervision and unclear accountability.

Method: Develops Network Behavior Lifecycle model (6 stages) and Agent for Agent (A4A) paradigm with Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity (HABD) model analyzing 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency, intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.

Result: Model effectiveness verified through real-world red team penetration and blue team defense cases, demonstrating practical applicability in distinguishing human and agent behaviors.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical foundation for secure human-agent collaboration, with future research directions including dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks.

Abstract: Advancements in AI have led to agents in networked environments increasingly
mirroring human behavior, thereby blurring the boundary between artificial and
human actors in specific contexts. This shift brings about significant
challenges in trust, responsibility, ethics, security and etc. The difficulty
in supervising of agent behaviors may lead to issues such as data contamination
and unclear accountability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes
the "Network Behavior Lifecycle" model, which divides network behavior into 6
stages and systematically analyzes the behavioral differences between humans
and agents at each stage. Based on these insights, the paper further introduces
the "Agent for Agent (A4A)" paradigm and the "Human-Agent Behavioral Disparity
(HABD)" model, which examine the fundamental distinctions between human and
agent behaviors across 5 dimensions: decision mechanism, execution efficiency,
intention-behavior consistency, behavioral inertia, and irrational patterns.
The effectiveness of the model is verified through real-world cases such as red
team penetration and blue team defense. Finally, the paper discusses future
research directions in dynamic cognitive governance architecture, behavioral
disparity quantification, and meta-governance protocol stacks, aiming to
provide a theoretical foundation and technical roadmap for secure and
trustworthy human-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: Using structured examples from planning solutions to improve LLM-based agents' perspective-taking in ReAct framework shows limited success, with agents still struggling with complex mentalizing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent challenges in perspective-taking capabilities of LLM-based agents, particularly in tasks requiring active perception, collaborative reasoning, and understanding what other agents can see or know.

Method: Proposed a structured solution-processing pipeline generating three types of examples from Fast Downward planner solutions: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths (E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences with alternative actions (L-type), converted into "thought-action" examples via LLM prompting.

Result: L-type examples slightly reduced clarification requests and action steps but didn't yield consistent improvements. Agents succeeded in basic attentional filtering but struggled with mentalizing about occluded spaces and weighing epistemic action costs.

Conclusion: Structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking; explicit belief tracking, cost modeling, and richer environments are needed for socially grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometry solving systems lack unified frameworks and struggle with verification due to reliance on intuitive diagrams, making integration with other mathematical fields difficult.

Method: Developed LeanGeo within Lean 4 theorem prover with comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems, and created LeanGeo-Bench benchmark with IMO and advanced geometry problems.

Result: Evaluation shows capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmark, demonstrating the system's effectiveness for formal geometry problem solving.

Conclusion: LeanGeo provides a unified framework for rigorous geometry problem solving and verification, highlighting the need for further advancements in automated geometric reasoning.

Abstract: Geometry problems are a crucial testbed for AI reasoning capabilities. Most

features a comprehensive library of high-level geometric theorems with Lean's
foundational logic, enabling rigorous proof verification and seamless
integration with Mathlib. We also present LeanGeo-Bench, a formal geometry
benchmark in LeanGeo, comprising problems from the International Mathematical

TL;DR: H-J is a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses urban flood emergency scheduling challenges by integrating knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization, outperforming existing methods in traffic flow and system robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme urban rainfall events cause severe traffic congestion and service disruptions, but current emergency scheduling systems struggle with dynamic trade-offs between competing goals, rapidly changing environmental conditions, and instability in LLM-generated strategies.

Method: H-J framework uses hierarchical multi-agent architecture with knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven optimization to create a closed-loop pipeline from multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement.

Result: Evaluation on real-world urban topology and rainfall data shows H-J outperforms rule-based and reinforcement-learning baselines across extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily light rain conditions in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and system robustness.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the promise of uncertainty-aware, knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing urban flood response resilience through better dynamic decision-making and multi-agent coordination.

Abstract: In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme urban rainfall events
has posed significant challenges to emergency scheduling systems. Urban
flooding often leads to severe traffic congestion and service disruptions,
threatening public safety and mobility. However, effective decision making
remains hindered by three key challenges: (1) managing trade-offs among
competing goals (e.g., traffic flow, task completion, and risk mitigation)
requires dynamic, context-aware strategies; (2) rapidly evolving environmental
conditions render static rules inadequate; and (3) LLM-generated strategies
frequently suffer from semantic instability and execution inconsistency.
Existing methods fail to align perception, global optimization, and multi-agent
coordination within a unified framework. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce H-J, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that integrates
knowledge-guided prompting, entropy-constrained generation, and feedback-driven
optimization. The framework establishes a closed-loop pipeline spanning from
multi-source perception to strategic execution and continuous refinement. We
evaluate H-J on real-world urban topology and rainfall data under three
representative conditions: extreme rainfall, intermittent bursts, and daily
light rain. Experiments show that H-J outperforms rule-based and
reinforcement-learning baselines in traffic smoothness, task success rate, and
system robustness. These findings highlight the promise of uncertainty-aware,
knowledge-constrained LLM-based approaches for enhancing resilience in urban
flood response.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges like long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces in MCP (Model Context Protocol) environments.

Method: Created MCP-Universe benchmark with 6 core domains spanning 11 MCP servers. Implemented execution-based evaluators including format evaluators, static evaluators for content matching, and dynamic evaluators for real-time ground truth retrieval.

Result: Even SOTA models show significant limitations: GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%), Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%). Benchmark reveals long-context challenges and unknown-tools issues. Enterprise agents like Cursor perform no better than standard ReAct frameworks.

Conclusion: The benchmark exposes critical limitations in current LLM capabilities for real-world MCP interactions and provides an open-source extensible framework to foster innovation in the MCP ecosystem.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

### [82] [Data-Driven Probabilistic Evaluation of Logic Properties with PAC-Confidence on Mealy Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14710)
*Swantje Plambeck,Ali Salamati,Eyke Huellermeier,Goerschwin Fey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data-driven PAC learning approach to determine safety probabilities for Cyber-Physical Systems with discrete Mealy machine abstractions, using active learning for guided sampling and validated on an automated lane-keeping system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyber-Physical Systems often lack suitable models for verification and diagnosis tasks, making manual extraction difficult. Data-driven approaches are needed to address verification problems based on system-collected data.

Method: Proposes a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning paradigm to connect discrete logic with probabilistic reachability analysis. Uses active learning with guided sampling after initial data collection to learn safety probabilities over finite time horizons.

Result: The approach provides an additional confidence measure on determined safety probabilities and is validated through a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges discrete system abstractions with probabilistic safety analysis, offering a data-driven solution for CPS verification with quantifiable confidence bounds.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are complex systems that require powerful models
for tasks like verification, diagnosis, or debugging. Often, suitable models
are not available and manual extraction is difficult. Data-driven approaches
then provide a solution to, e.g., diagnosis tasks and verification problems
based on data collected from the system. In this paper, we consider CPS with a
discrete abstraction in the form of a Mealy machine. We propose a data-driven
approach to determine the safety probability of the system on a finite horizon
of n time steps. The approach is based on the Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning paradigm. Thus, we elaborate a connection between discrete logic
and probabilistic reachability analysis of systems, especially providing an
additional confidence on the determined probability. The learning process
follows an active learning paradigm, where new learning data is sampled in a
guided way after an initial learning set is collected. We validate the approach
with a case study on an automated lane-keeping system.

*Siyuan Song,Harvey Lederman,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for a thicker definition of AI introspection, proposing that true introspection requires processes more reliable than what third parties can achieve at equal or lower computational cost. Through experiments with LLMs reasoning about temperature parameters, the authors show models can appear to have lightweight introspection while failing meaningful introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no consensus on how to define introspection in AI models, and existing 'lightweight' definitions may be insufficient to capture meaningful introspection capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a new thicker definition of introspection and conduct experiments where large language models reason about their internal temperature parameters to test both lightweight and their proposed thicker introspection.

Result: LLMs can appear to have lightweight introspection capabilities but fail to demonstrate meaningful introspection according to the authors' proposed thicker definition that requires reliability beyond what third parties can achieve.

Conclusion: A thicker definition of introspection is needed to properly evaluate AI models' true introspective capabilities, as lightweight definitions may lead to false positives where models appear introspective without genuine understanding of internal states.

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

### [84] [From Image Captioning to Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14045)
*Admitos Passadakis,Yingjin Song,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Visual Storytelling framework that treats it as a superset of Image Captioning, using vision-to-language for captions then language-to-language for coherent narratives, with improved quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance between story grounding to image sequences and narrative coherence in Visual Storytelling, addressing the challenge of creating stories that are both visually grounded and narratively compelling.

Method: Two-stage approach: first employ vision-to-language model for image captions, then transform captions into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods, treating Visual Storytelling as superset of Image Captioning.

Result: Positive impact on story quality, accelerated training time, and framework reusability/reproducibility. Proposed new 'ideality' metric to simulate distance from oracle model and emulate human-likeness.

Conclusion: Integrating captioning and storytelling under unified framework effectively balances visual grounding and narrative coherence while improving efficiency and accessibility.

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes English-Chinese news corpora to compare constituent order differences, finding English prefers core-first with post-positioned functional chunks while Chinese prefers background-first with pre-positioned chunks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore differences in constituent order between English and Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with adverbial roles, and analyze their positional preferences and distribution patterns.

Method: Analysis of comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language Model (LLM), focusing on functional chunks with adverbial roles.

Result: English news prefers linear narrative (core information first) with mostly post-positioned functional chunks, while Chinese prefers overall presentation (background first) with often pre-positioned chunks. Both languages show differences in SVO structure distribution, with Chinese pre-positioning being more significant. Both show high flexibility in co-occurring function blocks driven by information and pragmatic purposes.

Conclusion: Word order exhibits both systematic preference and dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of English-Chinese information structure.

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

TL;DR: Study on confidence estimation methods for LLM-generated SQL queries without gold answers, comparing black-box and white-box approaches with execution-based grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess reliability of model-generated SQL queries when access to model weights/gradients is constrained, particularly for large language models in text-to-SQL tasks.

Method: Explored both black-box (consistency-based) and white-box (SQL-syntax-aware logit interpretation) confidence estimation strategies on cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks, with execution-based query grounding.

Result: Consistency-based methods performed best among black-box models, while SQL-syntax-aware approaches were most effective for white-box settings. Execution-based grounding improved both approaches.

Conclusion: Effective confidence estimation for text-to-SQL is achievable through appropriate black-box/white-box methods, with execution grounding providing valuable supplementary signals for reliability assessment.

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

### [89] [Assessing and Mitigating Data Memorization Risks in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14062)
*Badrinath Ramakrishnan,Akshaya Balaji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs increases privacy risks from 0-5% to 60-75% data leakage. Proposed multi-layered protection framework reduces leakage to 0% while maintaining 94.7% model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' tendency to memorize training data during fine-tuning poses significant privacy risks, especially with repeated sensitive data exposure.

Method: Four complementary privacy protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Tested on GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2 architectures.

Result: Fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage from baseline 0-5% to 60-75% (64.2% average increase). Protection methods reduce leakage to 0% while preserving 94.7% of original model utility.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-layered privacy protection framework effectively mitigates data memorization risks in fine-tuned LLMs without significantly compromising model performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

### [90] [Punctuation and Predicates in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14067)
*Sonakshi Chauhan,Maheep Chaudhary,Koby Choy,Samuel Nellessen,Nandi Schoots*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how punctuation tokens and different reasoning components are processed across layers in LLMs, revealing model-specific differences in punctuation importance and distinct processing patterns for conditional statements vs universal quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where information is collected and propagated in LLMs, particularly examining the computational importance of punctuation tokens (previously identified as attention sinks) and how different reasoning components are processed differently.

Method: Used intervention-based techniques including interchange intervention and layer-swapping experiments on GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma models to evaluate necessity and sufficiency of punctuation tokens and analyze processing of different input components.

Result: Found stark model-specific differences: punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple GPT-2 layers, less so in DeepSeek, and not at all in Gemma. Also discovered that conditional statements (if/then) and universal quantification are processed very differently.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into LLM internal mechanisms for punctuation usage and reasoning, with implications for model interpretability, showing that different models process punctuation and reasoning components in distinct ways across layers.

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [91] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DLLMQuant is a novel post-training quantization framework specifically designed for diffusion-based LLMs that addresses unique challenges like dynamic masking and iterative generation through three key techniques: temporal-mask adaptive sampling, interaction-aware activation quantization, and certainty-guided quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs suffer from severe accuracy degradation (up to 16% drop) when using standard PTQ methods due to their unique mechanisms like dynamic masking, iterative generation, and bidirectional attention that clash with quantization.

Method: Proposes DLLMQuant with three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling (TMAS) for calibration across timesteps, 2) Interaction-Aware Activation Quantization (IA-AQ) using bidirectional attention signals, and 3) Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ) integrating mask status and token scores.

Result: DLLMQuant achieves significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency, successfully overcoming the accuracy degradation issues that plague standard PTQ methods when applied to diffusion-based LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the core quantization challenges in diffusion-based LLMs by accounting for their unique temporal, masking, and attention characteristics, enabling efficient deployment without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

TL;DR: MMReview is a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate peer review comments across 17 research domains with 240 papers and 13 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based review systems lack a unified evaluation benchmark, especially for handling multimodal content like figures and tables in peer review scenarios.

Method: Created MMReview benchmark with 240 papers across 17 domains in 4 academic disciplines, featuring multimodal content and expert-written reviews. Designed 13 tasks in 4 categories to evaluate LLMs/MLLMs on review generation, outcome formulation, human alignment, and robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and 5 closed-source models demonstrate the benchmark's thoroughness and effectiveness in assessing model performance.

Conclusion: MMReview provides a standardized foundation for developing automated peer review systems and represents a critical step forward in evaluating multimodal review capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

### [93] [DPad: Efficient Diffusion Language Models with Suffix Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14148)
*Xinhua Chen,Sitao Huang,Cong Guo,Chiyue Wei,Yintao He,Jianyi Zhang,Hai "Hellen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPad is a training-free method that speeds up diffusion-based LLMs by restricting attention to nearby suffix tokens using sliding window and distance-decay dropout, achieving 61.4x speedup while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs suffer from high computational overhead because they predict all future suffix tokens at each decoding step while only retaining a small fraction, making them inefficient for long-sequence inference.

Method: DPad integrates two strategies: (1) a sliding window that maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (2) distance-decay dropout that deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This training-free approach is compatible with existing optimizations like prefix caching.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations show DPad delivers up to 61.4x speedup over vanilla diffusion-based LLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models.

Conclusion: DPad offers an efficient and scalable solution for long-sequence inference in diffusion-based LLMs, requiring minimal code changes while significantly reducing computational overhead without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

*Johannes Zschache,Tilman Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM inference energy consumption varies widely (<mWh to >kWh) and correlates strongly with runtime. Larger LLMs consume more energy with lower accuracy, while best-performing models can also be energy-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the energy efficiency and sustainability concerns of LLM deployment in NLP, particularly focusing on the understudied inference phase rather than just training energy consumption.

Method: Systematic empirical evaluation of trade-offs between model accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various model architectures and hardware configurations.

Result: Found that best-performing models can be energy-efficient, larger LLMs consume significantly more energy with lower accuracy, and inference energy consumption shows strong correlation with model runtime.

Conclusion: Execution time can serve as practical proxy for energy usage, providing actionable insights for sustainable AI development and helping balance performance with resource efficiency in NLP applications.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that

closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic

### [96] [Disentangling concept semantics via multilingual averaging in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14275)
*Cliff O'Reilly,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Averaging concept activations across multiple languages helps isolate semantic concepts from syntactic/language-specific information in LLMs, improving alignment with true ontological relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLM shortcomings by connecting them with formal knowledge representation and isolating concept semantics from entangled syntactic and language-specific information.

Method: Use Sparse Autoencoders on Gemma 2B LLM to obtain concept activations for OWL ontology classes in English, French, and Chinese, then average activations across languages to derive conceptual averages.

Result: Conceptual averages from multiple languages align better with true ontological relationships between classes compared to single-language activations alone.

Conclusion: This technique enables more accurate mechanistic interpretation of internal network states by isolating pure semantic concepts through cross-language averaging.

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

TL;DR: GRILE is the first open benchmark with 1,151 Romanian exam questions to evaluate LLMs' answer selection and explanation generation capabilities for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the pedagogical value and linguistic capabilities of LLMs for low-resource languages like Romanian, where their educational potential remains unclear despite NLP advancements.

Method: Created a benchmark from Romanian high-stakes exams, tested 7 multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs on answer selection and explanation generation, with expert review of explanations for factual/pedagogical flaws.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro achieved 83% accuracy, but most open-weight models stayed below 65%, with 48% of explanations containing errors. Systematic weaknesses found in morphology and orthographic norms application.

Conclusion: The study exposes significant challenges for educational NLP in low-resource settings and establishes GRILE as a test-bed for controllable explanation generation and evaluation, with all data and tools released for future research.

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

### [98] [Tokens with Meaning: A Hybrid Tokenization Approach for NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14292)
*M. Ali Bayram,Ali Arda Fincan,Ahmet Semih Gümüş,Sercan Karakaş,Banu Diri,Savaş Yıldırım,Demircan Çelik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid tokenization framework combining rule-based morphological analysis with statistical subword segmentation, specifically designed for morphologically rich languages like Turkish, achieving superior performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subword tokenization methods like BPE and WordPiece struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure, leading to poor segmentation and vocabulary inefficiency.

Method: Hybrid approach combining rule-based morphological analysis (phonological normalization, root-affix dictionaries) with statistical subword segmentation. Uses shared identifiers for phonologically variant affixes, special tokens for whitespace/case, and integrates BPE for out-of-vocabulary coverage while maintaining morphological coherence.

Result: Achieved highest Turkish Token Percentage (90.29%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8%) on TR-MMLU benchmark. Outperformed tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT, producing more linguistically meaningful and coherent tokens.

Conclusion: The framework provides a language-independent approach for more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems, demonstrated successfully on Turkish but adaptable to other morphologically rich languages.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A joint multitask model using XLM-RoBERTa with three specialized decoders achieves state-of-the-art performance on morphological and syntactic parsing across nine diverse languages in the UniDive 2025 shared task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified system that can simultaneously handle both morphological and syntactic parsing following the novel UD annotation scheme, addressing the need for comprehensive morphosyntactic analysis across typologically diverse languages.

Method: Uses a shared XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders: one for content word identification, one for dependency parsing, and one for morphosyntactic feature prediction, creating a joint multitask learning framework.

Result: Achieved best overall performance with average MSLAS score of 78.7%, LAS of 80.1%, and Feats F1 of 90.3% across nine languages. Ablation studies showed gold tokenization and content word identification are crucial for performance.

Conclusion: The joint multitask approach is effective for morphosyntactic parsing, though the model still struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and nominal features across different languages, indicating areas for future improvement.

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word
identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. Our
model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

*Aman Goel,Daniel Schwartz,Yanjun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finch-Zk is a black-box framework that detects and mitigates LLM hallucinations using cross-model consistency checking without external knowledge, achieving significant improvements in detection and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to generating plausible but factually inaccurate content (hallucinations), creating reliability issues for production systems that need factual accuracy.

Method: Uses fine-grained cross-model consistency checking by comparing responses from diverse models on semantically-equivalent prompts, plus targeted mitigation to correct problematic segments while preserving accurate content.

Result: Improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39% on FELM dataset, and achieves 7-8 percentage point accuracy improvement on GPQA-diamond dataset with state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready solution for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems through effective hallucination detection and mitigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

*Jing Chen,Zhiheng Yang,Yixian Shen,Jie Liu,Adam Belloum,Chrysa Papagainni,Paola Grosso*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SurveyGen-I is an automatic survey generation framework that uses coarse-to-fine retrieval, adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation to create coherent, comprehensive scientific surveys with better citation coverage than previous LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based survey generation approaches struggle with maintaining coherence across long multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive citation coverage, limiting their effectiveness in scientific communication.

Method: Combines coarse-to-fine retrieval (survey-level then subsection-level), adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation with a memory mechanism that stores previously written content and terminology to ensure coherence across subsections.

Result: Experiments across four scientific domains show SurveyGen-I consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and citation coverage.

Conclusion: SurveyGen-I successfully addresses key limitations in automated survey generation by maintaining coherence across long documents and providing comprehensive citation coverage through its innovative memory-guided approach.

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

TL;DR: A behavior-aligned retriever (BAR) is trained to provide consistent demonstrations that help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions, reducing erroneous function calls while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for tool-augmented LLMs suffer from high training overhead and inconsistent demonstration samples that misguide function invocation behavior, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs.

Method: Constructed a corpus with different function-calling behaviors, trained a behavior-aligned retriever using contrastive learning with customized positive/negative pairs and dual-negative contrastive loss to ensure robust retrieval of behaviorally consistent examples.

Result: Significantly reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance.

Conclusion: Provides a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs by ensuring behaviorally consistent demonstrations for better tool-using decisions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with zero-shot assessment of Chinese reading comprehension difficulty aligned with students' cognitive abilities, but show improvement with in-context examples, revealing both emerging capabilities and systematic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to assess reading material difficulty in alignment with students' cognitive development stages, particularly for Chinese language education based on Zone of Proximal Development principles.

Method: Created ZPD-SCA benchmark annotated by 60 Special Grade teachers (top 0.15% nationwide), tested LLMs in zero-shot and in-context learning scenarios across different student age groups and reading genres.

Result: LLMs performed poorly in zero-shot learning (some below random guessing), improved substantially with in-context examples (nearly double accuracy), but showed systematic directional biases and significant performance variations across genres.

Conclusion: LLMs possess emerging but limited abilities for educational alignment assessment; ZPD-SCA provides foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLM confidence estimates faithfully correspond to actual correctness in decision-critical domains, addressing limitations of existing calibration methods that require additional supervision or parameter updates.

Method: Establishes a structured interaction loop where LLMs receive feedback based on alignment between predicted confidence and correctness, using feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance.

Result: Extensive experiments across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in evaluation metrics for LLM calibration.

Conclusion: Game-based prompting shows potential as an effective strategy for LLM calibration, providing a novel approach that doesn't require additional supervision or parameter updates.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

### [106] [DEPTH: Hallucination-Free Relation Extraction via Dependency-Aware Sentence Simplification and Two-tiered Hierarchical Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14391)
*Yupei Yang,Fan Feng,Lin Yang,Wanxi Deng,Lin Qu,Biwei Huang,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEPTH is a framework that reduces relation extraction hallucinations in LLMs through dependency-aware sentence simplification and two-tiered hierarchical refinement, achieving 17.2% F1 improvement and reducing hallucinations to 7.0%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with reliably determining whether relations exist in complex sentences, leading to spurious predictions and noisy knowledge graphs that compromise downstream reliability.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Grounding module extracts relations using shortest dependency paths to create minimal relational contexts, (2) Refinement module aggregates and revises predictions holistically. Includes causality-driven reward model for robust RLHF fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks show DEPTH reduces average hallucination rate to 7.0% and achieves 17.2% improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DEPTH effectively addresses LLM hallucinations in relation extraction through syntactic simplification and hierarchical refinement, significantly improving reliability and performance while maintaining knowledge graph integrity.

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Yinghan Zhou,Weifeng Zhu,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Zhengxian Wu,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with self-recognition in individual text evaluation but perform well when comparing pairs. The paper identifies Implicit Territorial Awareness and proposes Cognitive Surgery to improve individual text authorship identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show reliable self-recognition when comparing text pairs but fail dramatically when evaluating single texts individually. The underlying causes for this performance gap were not systematically analyzed.

Method: Proposed Cognitive Surgery (CoSur) framework with four modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship discrimination, and cognitive editing to awaken the model's latent Implicit Territorial Awareness.

Result: The method improved performance of three different LLMs in individual presentation paradigm, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01% respectively.

Conclusion: LLMs possess latent self-recognition capabilities (Implicit Territorial Awareness) that can be effectively activated through structured cognitive interventions, bridging the performance gap between pair and individual text evaluation paradigms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

TL;DR: A fine-tuning framework that injects knowledge graph information into language models using GNN encoding and fusion mechanisms to improve entity-level semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address missing reasoning chains and insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in LLMs when handling tasks requiring structured knowledge.

Method: Knowledge graph injection framework using GNNs to encode entities/relations, fusion mechanism to combine KG embeddings with LM contextual representations, gating mechanism to balance linguistic vs structural knowledge, and joint loss function for task performance and structural alignment.

Result: Significantly enhances model's ability to represent complex semantic units, shows better semantic consistency and contextual logic in structural reasoning and entity extraction tasks across entity recognition, QA, and language generation.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework effectively improves knowledge integration and reasoning capabilities in language models, validated through systematic experiments showing robustness and stability.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

TL;DR: Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 is a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with 6x higher inference throughput for reasoning workloads compared to similarly-sized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase throughput for reasoning workloads while maintaining high accuracy by replacing most self-attention layers with more efficient Mamba-2 layers, enabling faster generation of long thinking traces needed for reasoning.

Method: Built on Nemotron-H architecture, pre-trained a 12B parameter model on 20T tokens using FP8 training, then aligned and compressed using Minitron strategy to enable inference on 128k tokens with single GPU (A10G, 22GiB memory, bfloat16).

Result: Achieves on-par or better accuracy than similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B) on reasoning benchmarks while delivering up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings (8k input, 16k output tokens).

Conclusion: Successfully demonstrates that hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture can significantly improve inference efficiency for reasoning workloads without sacrificing accuracy, making high-performance reasoning more accessible with single GPU deployment.

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model
(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.
After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,
Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with
the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

### [111] [Reasoning is about giving reasons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14488)
*Krunal Shah,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a new intermediate representation called Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) to understand and extract the logical structure of natural language arguments, enabling more interpretable and extensible reasoning capabilities beyond simple rule chaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer approaches for logical reasoning suffer from poor interpretability and limited extensibility - they can chain rules but cannot articulate the underlying reasons, support abduction, or identify contradictions. The authors aim to address these shortcomings by capturing the true logical structure of arguments.

Method: The authors introduce an intermediate representation (RLS) that identifies logical atoms and the rules incorporating them in natural language arguments. This representation captures the core logical structure, making reasoning deterministic and computable.

Result: The method successfully identifies and extracts logical structures from three popular reasoning datasets with high accuracy, supporting explanation generation and significantly extending reasoning capabilities including arbitrary reasoning depths, mistake rectification, and interactive discussion.

Conclusion: The RLS representation provides a foundation for more interpretable and comprehensive logical reasoning that can handle various reasoning tasks beyond simple rule chaining, making it a promising approach for advanced argument analysis and explanation generation.

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoTale is a new Danish/English emotional speech corpus addressing the lack of datasets for smaller languages like Danish, with SER models achieving 64.1% UAR using self-supervised embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of emotional speech datasets for smaller languages like Danish, where only one other database (DES from 1997) exists.

Method: Created EmoTale corpus with Danish/English emotional speech recordings. Developed SER models using self-supervised speech model embeddings and openSMILE features with leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation.

Result: Self-supervised embeddings outperformed hand-crafted features. Best model achieved 64.1% UAR on EmoTale, comparable to performance on the DES reference dataset.

Conclusion: EmoTale provides a valid emotional speech corpus for Danish, demonstrating that SSLMs are effective for emotion recognition in smaller languages, with performance matching existing benchmarks.

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as
Danish. To our knowledge, Danish Emotional Speech (DES), published in 1997, is
the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable
to the performance on DES.

*Guilhem Fauré,Mostafa Sadeghi,Sam Bigeard,Slim Ouni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes two enhancements to Progressive Transformers for sign language production: quaternion-based pose encoding with geodesic loss for better angular joint movements, and contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of high intra-class variability in sign language production caused by signer morphology and stylistic variations in training data, improving robustness to such variations.

Method: Two main enhancements: 1) Encoding poses using bone rotations in quaternion space with geodesic loss, 2) Introducing contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings using gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity.

Result: On Phoenix14T dataset: contrastive loss alone yields 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over baseline. Combined with quaternion encoding achieves 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error.

Conclusion: Incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive objectives benefits Transformer-based sign language production models by improving pose representations.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Southern Uzbek has 5 million speakers but is underrepresented in NLP, with significant differences from Northern Uzbek in phonology, lexicon, and orthography

Method: Created parallel datasets (FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 sentences from multiple sources), fine-tuned NLLB-200 model, developed post-processing for Arabic-script half-space characters

Result: Developed comprehensive resources including datasets, models, and tools for Southern Uzbek machine translation with improved morphological boundary handling

Conclusion: All resources released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other low-resource languages

Abstract: Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million
people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in
phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers,
Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present
new resources for Southern Uzbek machine translation, including a 997-sentence
FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from dictionary, literary, and web
sources, and a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy). We also propose a
post-processing method for restoring Arabic-script half-space characters, which
improves handling of morphological boundaries. All datasets, models, and tools
are released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other
low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel continuous sentiment scoring method using concept vector projection for literary texts, outperforming traditional tools and better matching human ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis for literary texts faces challenges with figurative language and ambiguity. Traditional dictionary tools underperform, especially for low-resource languages, while transformer models provide only coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis.

Method: Continuous sentiment scoring based on concept vector projection, trained on multilingual literary data to capture nuanced sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods.

Result: Outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings.

Conclusion: Enables more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature by providing continuous, nuanced sentiment scoring that better handles the complexities of literary texts.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies Softmax as a limitation in LLMs' in-context learning for quantifier tasks and linear functions, and proposes SSA (scaled signed averaging) as a superior alternative that significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies have revealed limitations in LLMs' remarkable in-context learning ability, particularly on tasks involving first-order quantifiers (all, some) and linear functions, with Softmax identified as a contributing factor to these constraints.

Method: The authors propose scaled signed averaging (SSA) as a novel alternative to the Softmax scoring function in attention mechanisms, and evaluate both encoder-only and decoder-only transformer models with this new approach.

Result: Empirical results show that SSA dramatically improves performance on target tasks involving quantifiers and linear functions. Models with SSA match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across various linguistic probing tasks.

Conclusion: SSA serves as an effective alternative to Softmax that addresses identified limitations in in-context learning, particularly for logical reasoning tasks involving quantifiers and linear functions, while maintaining or improving performance on general linguistic tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

TL;DR: ShizhenGPT is the first multimodal LLM for Traditional Chinese Medicine that addresses data scarcity and multimodal diagnostic challenges through a large curated dataset and achieves superior performance in TCM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limited application in TCM due to data scarcity and the multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics (looking, listening, smelling, pulse-taking) that conventional LLMs cannot handle.

Method: Curated largest TCM dataset (100GB+ text, 200GB+ multimodal data including 1.2M images, 200 hours audio, physiological signals). Pretrained and instruction-tuned ShizhenGPT for deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Leads in TCM visual understanding among existing multimodal LLMs. Demonstrates unified perception across sound, pulse, smell, and vision modalities.

Conclusion: ShizhenGPT paves the way for holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM. The work inspires further exploration in this field, with datasets, models, and code publicly available.

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation and address limitations of generic tokenizers in preserving recipe structures and precise numerical quantities.

Method: Comparative study using fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) vs GPT-2 small (124M) and LSTM/RNN baselines on RecipeDB 5-cuisine corpus, with custom tokenization adding 23 fraction tokens and structural markers.

Result: Large transformer approach achieved >20% relative improvement in BERTScore F1 (0.92 vs 0.72) over best recurrent baseline and reduced perplexity by 69.8%.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for advanced recipe generation research, though challenges remain in factual accuracy, paving way for integrating real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs.

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation
research.

### [119] [Transplant Then Regenerate: A New Paradigm for Text Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14723)
*Guangzhan Wang,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMTransplant is a novel text augmentation method that uses LLMs to create diverse content-level variants by transplanting seed text into expanded contexts and regenerating new versions, outperforming traditional augmentation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentation methods focus on lexical rephrasing with same semantics, while LLM-based approaches struggle with controlling style and structure. There's a need for methods that can leverage LLM knowledge to create more diverse and creative content variations while preserving core text attributes.

Method: LMTransplant uses a transplant-then-regenerate paradigm: 1) Incorporate seed text into a context expanded by LLM, 2) Ask the LLM to regenerate a variant based on the expanded context. This leverages LLM knowledge to create content-level diversity.

Result: LMTransplant demonstrates superior performance over existing text augmentation methods across various text-related tasks. It shows exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data grows.

Conclusion: The proposed LMTransplant paradigm effectively addresses limitations of traditional augmentation by leveraging LLMs' knowledge emergence capability to generate diverse content variations while maintaining core text attributes, showing strong performance and scalability.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

*Samir Abdaljalil,Erchin Serpedin,Khalid Qaraqe,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates LLMs' multilingual reasoning consistency using synthetic logic-based NLI pairs translated across diverse languages, finding code-switching can improve performance and serve as regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess large language models' capacity for consistent logical reasoning across languages, as current multilingual applications lack understanding of cross-lingual alignment robustness.

Method: Developed controlled evaluation framework with synthetic logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs, translated into typologically diverse languages, tested in monolingual and code-switched conditions with embedding-based similarity validation.

Result: Code-switching doesn't degrade and can even improve performance, suggesting translation-induced lexical variation acts as regularization; semantic preservation confirmed through embedding analyses.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both potential and brittleness in cross-lingual reasoning, with code-switching identified as a promising approach for enhancing multilingual robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

*Jiaming Leng,Yunying Bi,Chuan Qin,Bing Yin,Yanyong Zhang,Chao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransLLM is a unified framework that combines spatiotemporal modeling with large language models using learnable prompt composition to address diverse urban transportation tasks like traffic forecasting, EV charging prediction, and taxi dispatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, while large language models struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains.

Method: Uses a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder with dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, plus instance-level prompt routing trained via reinforcement learning to dynamically personalize prompts for LLM integration.

Result: Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks show exceptional effectiveness in both supervised and zero-shot settings, delivering competitive performance compared to ten baseline models on regression and planning problems.

Conclusion: TransLLM demonstrates strong generalization and cross-task adaptability, providing a unified solution that bridges the gap between specialized spatiotemporal models and flexible language models for urban transportation challenges.

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised

TL;DR: RAG approach for EHR analysis matches/exceeds recent notes performance with fewer tokens, showing efficiency even with newer long-context models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs are long, noisy and redundant, posing challenges for clinicians. LLMs struggle with context length limits for clinical notes.

Method: Proposed 3 clinical tasks: imaging procedure extraction, antibiotic timeline generation, key diagnosis identification. Tested 3 LLMs with varying context using RAG vs recent notes.

Result: RAG closely matched or exceeded recent notes performance, approached full context performance while requiring drastically fewer input tokens.

Conclusion: RAG remains competitive and efficient for EHR analysis even as newer models handle longer contexts, offering token-efficient clinical text processing.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

*Josh Barua,Seun Eisape,Kayo Yin,Alane Suhr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study shows English-centric reasoning doesn't transfer equally across languages - French benefits little, Japanese/Latvian improve with English reasoning, Swahili struggles significantly. Multilingual pretraining helps but gaps remain, and optimal data strategies vary by language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how long chain-of-thought reasoning transfers across different languages beyond English, as current reasoning capabilities in LLMs remain predominantly English-centric despite the potential for multilingual applications.

Method: Constructed translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and systematically studied long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili.

Result: English pivot language effectiveness varies: no benefit for French, improves Japanese/Latvian performance, insufficient for Swahili. Multilingual pretraining narrows but doesn't eliminate gaps. Lightweight fine-tuning (1k traces) improves Swahili by 30+%. Data quality vs scale trade-offs are language-dependent.

Conclusion: Long CoT transfer effectiveness depends on language characteristics, with English not universally effective as pivot. Multilingual pretraining helps but targeted fine-tuning and language-specific data strategies are needed for equitable multilingual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

TL;DR: A medical deep research agent that combines medical knowledge graph-based data synthesis and specialized retrieval tools to outperform larger proprietary systems on medical benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLM agents struggle with medical domain challenges due to lack of dense medical knowledge and absence of specialized retrieval tools for medical contexts.

Method: Two core innovations: 1) data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs to generate complex multi-hop QA pairs, 2) custom-built private medical retrieval engine alongside general tools. Two-stage training with supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning.

Result: Generated 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties. MedResearcher-R1-32B model achieves new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks.

Conclusion: Strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction enable smaller open-source models to outperform much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains like medicine.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform
much larger proprietary systems in specialized domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic study on quantizing diffusion-based language models (dLLMs), identifying activation outliers as key challenge and evaluating PTQ methods across multiple dimensions to enable efficient deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs show promise for natural language generation but face deployment challenges on edge devices due to massive parameter scale and high resource demands, while PTQ techniques for AR LLMs remain unexplored for dLLMs.

Method: Systematic study identifying activation outliers, implementing state-of-the-art PTQ methods, and conducting comprehensive evaluation across four dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type.

Result: Identified presence of activation outliers with abnormally large values that dominate dynamic range and pose challenges for low-bit quantization. Provided practical insights into quantization behavior under different configurations.

Conclusion: Findings provide foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment, with codes and experimental setups released to support the community.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

### [126] [Deep Learning for School Dropout Detection: A Comparison of Tabular and Graph-Based Models for Predicting At-Risk Students](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14057)
*Pablo G. Almeida,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Valéria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Pedro Silva,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs using graph structures from PCA-KMeans clustering outperformed traditional tabular models for student dropout prediction, achieving 7% higher F1-score and 2% higher accuracy than XGBoost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Student dropout causes significant social and economic costs. While traditional ML models work on tabular data, GNNs can capture complex relationships in student data when structured as graphs, potentially improving prediction accuracy for timely interventions.

Method: Transformed tabular student data into graph structures using clustering techniques (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP). Compared GNNs (custom GCN and GraphSAGE) against tabular models (Random Forest, XGBoost, TabNet) on real-world student dataset.

Result: GraphSAGE on PCA-KMeans derived graph achieved best performance: ~7 percentage points higher macro F1-score and ~2 percentage points higher accuracy than XGBoost. Other GNN configurations did not consistently outperform tabular models.

Conclusion: GNNs show potential for student dropout prediction but success depends heavily on graph generation strategy and architecture selection. Optimal transformation of tabular data for graph-based learning remains challenging but promising.

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

*Chinmoy Biswas,Nafis Faisal,Vivek Chowdhury,Abrar Al-Shadid Abir,Sabir Mahmud,Mithon Rahman,Shaikh Anowarul Fattah,Hafiz Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gaussian interpolation enables effective load forecasting on 62% sparse power plant data when treated as Wide Sense Stationary, with LSTM models performing best among various ML approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparsity in real-world datasets poses challenges for analysis and forecasting. Traditional interpolation methods work well with Strict Sense Stationary data, but many real datasets like power plant load data are only Wide Sense Stationary, requiring alternative approaches.

Method: Statistical analysis of hourly load data, application of Gaussian interpolation to handle 62% sparsity, and training multiple machine learning and deep learning models including classical methods and neural networks (specifically LSTM) for comparison.

Result: Gaussian interpolation proved suitable for handling sparse load forecasting data. Among all tested models, the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network demonstrated the best performance for load forecasting tasks.

Conclusion: Gaussian interpolation is an effective method for dealing with sparse datasets in load forecasting problems, particularly when data exhibits Wide Sense Stationarity rather than Strict Sense Stationarity. LSTM neural networks outperform other machine learning approaches for this application.

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

TL;DR: Hybrid ML-metaheuristic approach using edge solution selector to classify prohibited moves in Vehicle Routing Problems, improving performance across various problem sizes and variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance metaheuristic solutions for Vehicle Routing Problems by intelligently guiding local search through machine learning-based identification of prohibited moves.

Method: Two learning mechanisms: tabular binary classifier (Gradient Boosting Trees and Feedforward NN) and Graph Neural Network to predict prohibited edges. These are integrated into metaheuristic baselines with threshold adjustments for class imbalance.

Result: Method demonstrates scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements across different metaheuristics, problem sizes up to 30,000 nodes, and variants including CVRP and CVRPTW.

Conclusion: The hybrid ML-metaheuristic approach effectively guides local search by identifying prohibited moves, showing significant improvements in solving complex Vehicle Routing Problems with verified statistical significance.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCLPD is a semi-supervised learning framework that combines multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight supervised fine-tuning to improve cross-dataset Parkinson's disease detection from EEG data, achieving high performance with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost of EEG data annotation leads to limited dataset sizes and discrepancies across datasets (different acquisition protocols, subject demographics), which hinders model robustness and generalizability in cross-dataset Parkinson's disease detection scenarios.

Method: Proposes MCLPD framework with two phases: 1) Self-supervised pre-training on unlabeled UNM dataset using dual augmentations in both time and frequency domains to build contrastive pairs and fuse time-frequency information; 2) Lightweight supervised fine-tuning using only small proportions (1-5%) of labeled data from UI and UC datasets.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1% labeled data, improving to 0.97 and 0.87 respectively with 5% labeled data. Substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while reducing dependency on labeled data compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MCLPD demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing cross-dataset PD detection performance through semi-supervised learning, successfully addressing challenges of limited labeled data and dataset discrepancies while maintaining high detection accuracy.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Motivation: Address variability in EEG detection methods across datasets and small dataset sizes that challenge training generalizable models for Parkinson's disease classification.

Method: Uses generative network to create fusion EEG data with controlled distribution similarity, EEG signal quality assessment, and classification network with multiple CNNs to capture time-frequency characteristics.

Result: Achieves 84.3% accuracy and 84.0% F1-score in cross-dataset settings, performing comparably to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed GEPD model demonstrates strong generalizability for EEG-based Parkinson's disease detection across different datasets, facilitating neurological disease diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific preferences under limited data and across diverse domains, creating a need for more effective personalized alignment methods.

Method: Combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning, specifically designed to identify personal factors from few exemplars.

Result: Outperforms existing models of similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: Paves the way for more effective personalized LLMs by enabling better capture of user-specific preferences from limited data through reasoning-based reward modeling.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reinterpret label smoothing through the lens of information bottleneck theory and demonstrate its theoretical foundations and practical benefits.

Method: Theoretical analysis and experimental validation under assumptions of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels, showing label smoothing achieves information bottleneck optimal solutions.

Result: Label smoothing explores optimal information bottleneck solutions and exhibits insensitivity to non-informative factors or redundant information when conditioned on other variables.

Conclusion: Label smoothing serves as a simple yet effective practical approach to information bottleneck, providing theoretical justification for its empirical success and additional robustness properties.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

TL;DR: New ML framework combining reservoir engineering knowledge (PI-based feature selection) with Inductive Conformal Prediction for robust oil production forecasting, showing LSTM outperforms other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting by addressing multivariate time series analysis challenges and providing rigorous uncertainty quantification.

Method: Integrates Productivity Index-driven feature selection with Inductive Conformal Prediction. Tests LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and XGBoost algorithms on historical data from Volve and Norne oil fields for oil production rate forecasting.

Result: LSTM achieved best performance with lowest MAE (19.468 test, 29.638 out-of-sample for well PF14). PI-based feature selection reduced input dimensionality effectively. ICP provided valid prediction intervals without distributional assumptions.

Conclusion: Combining domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques significantly improves reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts, with LSTM showing superior performance among tested models.

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the

TL;DR: Comprehensive empirical study on robust fine-tuning reveals that supervised pretrained CNNs often outperform attention-based architectures and specialized robust pretrained models for adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models are vulnerable to input perturbations, and while robust fine-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative to training from scratch, the impact of various design choices (architecture, pretraining, adaptation protocols) on robust generalization remains poorly understood.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3 adaptation protocols, resulting in 1,440 training configurations and 7,200 robustness measurements across five perturbation types.

Result: Found that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best for robust generalization, challenging the assumption that attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are superior.

Conclusion: The study provides both confirmation and challenges to prior design assumptions, offers practical guidance for robust fine-tuning, and highlights promising research directions in adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

*Guanghao Jin,Jingpei Wu,Tianpei Guo,Yiyi Niu,Weidong Zhou,Guoyang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new benchmark called KnowDR-REC is proposed to evaluate Multi-modal Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities in Referring Expression Comprehension, featuring knowledge-driven tasks, negative samples, and novel evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional REC benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' reasoning capabilities due to reliance on intra-image cues only and lack of fine-grained annotations, creating a need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: The KnowDR-REC benchmark is built on real-world knowledge requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning, includes negative samples via expression editing to test robustness, and introduces three novel evaluation metrics to analyze model reasoning processes.

Result: Evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art multimodal models shows they struggle with knowledge-driven visual grounding tasks, revealing a decoupling between textual understanding and visual grounding, with models being influenced by memorized shortcut correlations.

Conclusion: The benchmark aims to inspire development of more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding frameworks for reliable multimodal systems in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

*Yoshimasa Kubo,Jean Erik Delanois,Maxim Bazhenov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm helps EP-trained RNNs overcome catastrophic forgetting in continuous learning, matching or surpassing BPTT-trained models on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in EP-trained RNNs during continuous learning, inspired by human brain's memory consolidation during sleep through replay mechanisms.

Method: Proposed sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs, implemented after each new task training in class-incremental learning scenarios.

Result: SRC significantly improved RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting. MRNN-EP with SRC performed on par with BPTT-trained models on MNIST and surpassed them on Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet. Combination with rehearsal further boosted long-term knowledge retention.

Conclusion: Sleep-like replay techniques are applicable to RNNs and show potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors into artificial neural networks.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

*Ye Su,Hezhe Qiao,Wei Huang,Lin Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRILL is a novel semi-supervised regression framework that transforms regression into discrete distribution estimation to improve label distribution learning and prevent overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-supervised regression methods rely heavily on pseudo-label quality and direct regression fails to learn label distribution properly, leading to overfitting.

Method: Transforms regression into Discrete Distribution Estimation over multiple buckets, uses Decoupled Distribution Alignment to align target and non-target bucket distributions between teacher and student models.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse domains show DRILL outperforms competing methods with strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: DRILL effectively addresses semi-supervised regression challenges by capturing label distribution through discrete estimation and distribution alignment, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a contrastive self-learning framework (CSST) for inferring accurate crowd flow at POIs from low-quality data using self-supervised graph representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate crowd flow monitoring at Points of Interest is crucial for traffic management and urban planning, but current urban sensing techniques produce inadequate data quality, making accurate inference challenging due to scarce labeled data, complex spatio-temporal dependencies, and correlations between precise flow and GPS reports.

Method: Recasts crowd flow inference as self-supervised attributed graph representation learning. Constructs spatial adjacency graph based on POIs and distances, uses contrastive learning with swapped prediction to exploit unlabeled spatio-temporal data, and fine-tunes with accurate crowd flow data after pre-training.

Result: Experiments on two real-world datasets show that the proposed CSST framework pre-trained on extensive noisy data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: The contrastive self-learning approach effectively addresses the challenges of crowd flow inference by leveraging large volumes of unlabeled data through self-supervised graph representation learning, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods.

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Scalable sparse regression framework for discovering PDEs and subgrid-scale closures from multi-parameter data, extending SINDy with parameter-aware innovations and achieving autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing sparse regression methods by enabling parameter-aware discovery of physical models from multi-parameter simulation data, particularly for identifying interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale closures without prior theoretical assumptions.

Method: Four key innovations: 1) symbolic parameterisation for varying physical parameters in unified regression, 2) Dimensional Similarity Filter for unit-consistency and library reduction, 3) memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation for batch processing, and 4) ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model identification.

Result: Successfully recovered governing equations across parameter ranges in 1D benchmarks. Discovered SGS closure τ_SGS = 0.1603·Δ²(∂ū/∂x)² with Smagorinsky constant ≈0.4004 from filtered Burgers data. Achieved R² = 0.886 across filter scales with improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures.

Conclusion: The framework enables autonomous discovery of physically meaningful SGS forms and coefficient calibration, providing a complementary data-driven approach to turbulence modeling that contributes to the field of data-driven closure discovery without requiring prior theoretical assumptions.

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

TL;DR: EEGDM: A lightweight EEG representation learning framework using diffusion models and structured state-space models that outperforms existing EEG foundation models while being 19x more efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG foundation models face challenges with high computational costs and marginal performance gains despite using transformer architectures. There's a need for more efficient yet effective EEG representation learning methods.

Method: Proposed EEGDM framework using structured state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to capture EEG temporal dynamics, trained with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and latent fusion transformer (LFT) for downstream classification.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art EEG foundation models on Temple University EEG Event Corpus while being approximately 19x more lightweight.

Conclusion: EEGDM provides a promising lightweight alternative to current EEG foundation models, offering better performance with significantly reduced computational costs.

Abstract: While electroencephalogram (EEG) has been a crucial tool for monitoring the
brain and diagnosing neurological disorders (e.g., epilepsy), learning
meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Applying large language model paradigm to experimental particle physics is challenging due to the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data which differs from natural language.

Method: Proposed novel self-supervised training method for detector data with models up to 188M parameters, using frozen weights and task-specific adapters for downstream tasks.

Result: The foundation model consistently outperforms baseline models across all downstream tasks and exhibits robust data-efficient adaptation. Representations are task-agnostic but can be specialized via single linear mapping.

Conclusion: Foundation models can successfully scale and generalize across diverse particle physics tasks, demonstrating the viability of self-supervised learning for experimental detector data.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

*Haomin Wen,Shurui Cao,Leman Akoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoBAD is a novel model for detecting collective anomalies in human mobility that captures spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals using a two-stage attention mechanism and pre-training on large-scale collective behavior data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collective anomaly detection in human mobility remains underexplored despite its importance for public safety and urban planning. Traditional methods focus on individual patterns, but collective anomalies require modeling interactions between individuals, which introduces additional complexity.

Method: Proposes CoBAD model with Collective Event Sequences (CES) and co-occurrence event graph. Uses two-stage attention mechanism to model individual mobility patterns and interactions across individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show CoBAD significantly outperforms existing baselines with 13%-18% improvement in AUCROC and 19%-70% improvement in AUCPR. Detects both unexpected co-occurrence anomalies and absence anomalies.

Conclusion: CoBAD effectively addresses the challenge of collective anomaly detection in human mobility by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

*Matthew Morris,David J. Tena Cucala,Bernardo Cuenca Grau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses explainability in GNN-based link prediction by extracting Datalog rules from monotonic GNNs with scoring functions, providing sound explanations for predictions while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve explainability of GNNs for knowledge graph link prediction, as previous methods only addressed restricted graph encoding/decoding approaches and lacked explanations for more general scoring function-based approaches.

Method: Adapt GNNs and scoring functions to be monotonic, then extract Datalog rules using this monotonicity property to provide sound explanations for predictions. Define procedures for obtaining equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring functions.

Result: Experiments show that monotonic GNNs and scoring functions perform well on link prediction benchmarks and yield many sound rules for explanation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully bridges the gap between GNN explainability and practical link prediction methods using scoring functions, providing both performance and interpretability through rule extraction.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

TL;DR: Physics-informed reward machines (pRMs) enhance reinforcement learning by incorporating symbolic knowledge about physical environments, enabling more expressive reward specification and faster learning through counterfactual experiences and reward shaping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward machines improve RL expressiveness and programmability but don't incorporate physical knowledge. The authors aim to combine symbolic reward specification with physical environment understanding to further accelerate learning efficiency.

Method: Developed physics-informed reward machines (pRMs) that integrate physical knowledge into reward specification. Created RL algorithms that exploit pRMs through counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping techniques.

Result: Experimental results show pRMs significantly accelerate reward acquisition during training. Demonstrated effectiveness in both finite and continuous physical environments across multiple control tasks with improved learning efficiency.

Conclusion: pRMs provide a powerful framework for combining symbolic reward specification with physical knowledge, enabling more programmable, expressive, and efficient reinforcement learning in physical environments.

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

TL;DR: Prioritizing hard examples for GRPO fine-tuning yields 47% performance gains, while easy examples provide minimal improvements, offering practical guidance for budget-constrained alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting high-quality training data for language model fine-tuning is expensive, and practitioners need guidance on how to best allocate limited acquisition budgets by selecting examples of appropriate difficulty levels.

Method: Studied Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes and families, comparing four subset selection policies (easy, medium, hard, random difficulty) chosen from the same unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates via multi-sample evaluation.

Result: Training on the hardest examples yields the largest performance gains (up to 47%), while training on easy examples yields the smallest gains. Harder examples provide more learnable opportunities during GRPO training.

Conclusion: For budget-constrained post-training, prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning tasks when using GRPO, providing practical guidance for resource-constrained alignment.

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

TL;DR: IHNN is a novel implicit hypergraph neural network that captures long-range dependencies through fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges, outperforming existing methods in node classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hypergraph neural networks suffer from limited message-passing rounds that only capture local information and degrade performance when trying to capture long-range dependencies, creating a need for better methods to handle high-order relationships.

Method: Proposes Implicit Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN) that jointly learns fixed-point representations for nodes and hyperedges using implicit differentiation and a tractable projected gradient descent approach for efficient training.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs show IHNN outperforms prior works in most node classification settings, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in hypergraph learning.

Conclusion: IHNN successfully addresses the long-range dependency limitation in hypergraph neural networks through implicit learning of fixed-point representations, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Method: Conducted theoretical analysis of TRPO and PPO optimization landscapes under KL-divergence and policy clipping constraints with varying action dimensions, complemented by empirical evaluation using Gymnasium Swimmer environment with controlled kinematic variations.

Result: Analysis reveals how action space dimensionality influences trust region optimization behavior under different constraint mechanisms (KL-divergence vs policy clipping).

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights into trust region methods' behavior with morphological variations, offering guidance for scalable and reusable control policies across different kinematic structures.

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

### [151] [A Cost-Effective Framework for Predicting Parking Availability Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14125)
*Madyan Bagosher,Tala Mustafa,Mohammad Alsmirat,Amal Al-Ali,Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smart parking framework using multiple data sources without physical sensors, with Random Forest Regression performing best among tested models for parking occupancy prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban growth creates parking challenges, especially on university campuses where students need quick access to vacant spots during class times. Limited parking availability necessitates efficient allocation systems.

Method: Integrated street maps, mobility, and meteorological data through spatial join operations over 3 consecutive days (7AM-3PM hourly). Evaluated Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest Regression, and LSTM models with grid search hyperparameter tuning. Used RMSE, MAE, and R2 for performance assessment.

Result: Random Forest Regression achieved the best performance with lowest RMSE (0.142) and highest R2 (0.582). LSTM may perform better with more data and longer timesteps due to time-series nature.

Conclusion: The framework provides effective parking occupancy prediction without physical sensors. Random Forest performed best in current setup, but LSTM shows promise for future improvements with expanded data.

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

*S. Josyula,Y. Noiman,E. J. Payton,T. Giovannelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning models combined with optimization algorithms to design shape memory alloys with target martensitic start temperature while minimizing cost, showing gradient-based optimization with neural networks outperforms derivative-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing affordable and sustainable shape memory alloys that meet performance targets is challenging, requiring optimization of compositions to achieve desired martensitic start temperature while minimizing cost.

Method: Used two machine learning models (tree-based ensemble and neural network) trained on experimental SMA data with physics-informed features. Paired tree model with COBYLA (derivative-free optimizer) and neural network with TRUST-CONSTR (gradient-based optimizer) to search for optimal alloy combinations.

Result: Both models predicted Ms with similar accuracy, but TRUST-CONSTR with neural network found better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to suboptimal results, especially with poor initial guesses. Gradient-based optimization showed more stable behavior and better met both objectives.

Conclusion: Combining physics-informed data, machine learning, and optimization provides practical approach for SMA design. Neural networks with gradient-based optimization outperform derivative-free methods. Approach can be extended to other materials with limited data where design trade-offs are needed.

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

### [153] [ERIS: An Energy-Guided Feature Disentanglement Framework for Out-of-Distribution Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14134)
*Xin Wu,Fei Teng,Ji Zhang,Xingwang Li,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ERIS framework for time series classification uses energy-guided calibration, weight-level orthogonality, and adversarial training to achieve guided feature disentanglement for better out-of-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current time series classification methods suffer from poor out-of-distribution performance due to entangled domain-specific and label-relevant features, creating spurious correlations. Existing feature disentanglement approaches lack semantic guidance.

Method: End-to-end Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (ERIS) framework with three mechanisms: energy-guided calibration for semantic guidance, weight-level orthogonality for structural independence, and auxiliary adversarial training for robustness.

Result: ERIS improves state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy across four benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed ERIS framework successfully addresses the feature entanglement problem in time series classification by providing semantic guidance for effective disentanglement, leading to significant performance improvements on out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

TL;DR: Agent-based framework for adaptive sensor placement in modal testing using reinforcement learning to optimize sensor locations across frequency segments in dynamic test environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modal test design approaches are static and rigid, compromising accuracy and adaptability by not accounting for evolving test parameters and their impact on previously established decisions like sensor configurations.

Method: An agent-based decision support framework using underspecified partially observable Markov decision process, trained with dual-curriculum learning strategy for reinforcement learning agent.

Result: Case study on steel cantilever structure demonstrates efficacy in optimizing sensor locations across frequency segments, showing robustness and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses limitations of traditional static approaches by providing adaptive sensor placement capabilities for dynamic modal test environments.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

*Amalie Roark,Serio Agriesti,Francisco Camara Pereira,Guido Cantelmo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning framework improves MFD estimation with limited loop detector data by leveraging multi-city training and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams requires many loop detectors, which are often unavailable in practice, creating data scarcity challenges.

Method: Proposes meta-learning framework with Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, trained on multiple cities' data to estimate MFD for cities with limited detectors.

Result: Achieves average MSE improvement in flow prediction between ~17,500-36,000, successfully generalizing across diverse urban settings with limited data.

Conclusion: Meta-learning effectively addresses data scarcity in MFD estimation, outperforming traditional transfer learning and demonstrating strong transferability across cities.

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAS framework reduces SNN latency and energy consumption by 30-46% while improving accuracy through spatio-temporal adaptive computation and unified input representation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking neural networks have energy efficiency advantages but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to multi-timestep operations. Existing dynamic computation methods are fragmented and don't work well with SNN-based vision Transformers due to temporal dissimilarity issues.

Method: Proposed STAS framework with integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module for temporal stability and adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module for 2D token pruning across spatial and temporal axes. Co-designs static architecture and dynamic computation policy.

Result: Reduces energy consumption by 45.9% on CIFAR-10, 43.8% on CIFAR-100, and 30.1% on ImageNet while simultaneously improving accuracy over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: STAS successfully addresses temporal dissimilarity problems in SNN-based vision Transformers and enables efficient spatio-temporal adaptive computation, achieving significant energy savings with improved accuracy.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological neural circuits show efficient trade-offs between wiring cost, functional specialization, and robustness. The authors aim to incorporate these principles, specifically functional connectivity patterns from mouse visual cortex, into ANN design to improve efficiency and performance.

Method: Introduces G2GNet with sparse, modular connectivity across feedforward layers based on biological observations. Combines static structural bias with dynamic sparse training (DST) that prunes and regrows edges during training. Uses Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations.

Result: Achieves up to 75% sparsity while improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 benchmarks. Outperforms dense baselines with significantly fewer computations and parameters.

Conclusion: Biologically observed functional connectivity patterns can serve as effective structural biases in ANN design, enabling highly sparse yet accurate networks that outperform traditional dense architectures.

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

TL;DR: Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) proposes intelligence emerges from structured memory reuse rather than optimization from scratch, modeling cognition as inference over latent memory cycles instead of gradient recomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks in modern AI by reframing intelligence as non-ergodic processes that reuse prior inference trajectories rather than sampling uniformly or optimizing from scratch.

Method: Introduces MAI framework where cognition is inference over latent cycles in memory, using structural reuse to encode inductive biases and minimize entropy. Models cortical columns as local inference operators over cycle-consistent memory states through delta-homology.

Result: Establishes time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning: RL propagates value forward from reward while MAI reconstructs latent causes backward from memory. Provides principled foundation for Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm.

Conclusion: MAI offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on structure, reuse, and memory, paving the path toward energy-efficient inference and addressing computational bottlenecks for achieving AGI.

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

probabilistic version of the Temporal Graph Network Support Vector Data

experiments on a modified CIC-IDS2017 data set with synthetic noise demonstrate
significant improvements in detection performance compared to the baseline

Motivation: Previous VTP models overlook traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, so this research aims to provide comprehensive evaluation in varying traffic scenarios.

Method: Uses probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability, evaluates models on test samples categorized by traffic situation complexity during prediction horizon.

Result: Provides deeper understanding of strengths/weaknesses of different prediction approaches and their reliability for safe forecast horizons.

Conclusion: Findings can inform development of more reliable vessel trajectory prediction approaches to enhance safety and efficiency in inland waterways navigation.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel

TL;DR: GraphCBMs enhance Concept Bottleneck Models by incorporating latent concept graphs to capture relationships between concepts, improving classification performance and interpretability while enabling more effective interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent and ignore hidden relationships among concepts, despite concepts often being correlated in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposed GraphCBMs that construct latent concept graphs to facilitate concept relationships, which are combined with traditional CBMs to enhance performance while maintaining interpretability.

Result: Superior performance in image classification tasks, provides more concept structure information for interpretability, enables more effective interventions using latent concept graphs, and demonstrates robustness across different training and architecture settings.

Conclusion: GraphCBMs successfully address the limitation of ignoring concept relationships in traditional CBMs, offering improved performance, better interpretability, and more effective intervention capabilities while maintaining robustness.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

*Liyi Zhang,Jake Snell,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ABMLL is an amortized Bayesian meta-learning approach for LoRA fine-tuning that improves generalization while maintaining computational efficiency and providing better uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for improving generalization in LoRA fine-tuning are computationally expensive, requiring long-context prompts or second-order gradient updates, which limits scalability to large LLMs.

Method: Adapts amortized Bayesian meta-learning to LLMs by reframing task-specific and global parameters in LoRA context, using new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and parameter fidelity.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on Unified-QA and CrossFit benchmarks in both accuracy and expected calibration error, scales to large models like Llama3-8B.

Conclusion: ABMLL provides computationally efficient generalization improvement for LoRA fine-tuning with enhanced uncertainty quantification, making it suitable for large-scale LLM applications.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

TL;DR: GLASS introduces training-free dynamic pruning methods for LLMs that combine prompt-specific local statistics with model-intrinsic global statistics to select FFN units, outperforming previous zero-shot methods without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployment of LLMs requires aggressive pruning to reduce computation while maintaining quality, but existing methods either use fixed sparsity patterns, add runtime overhead, or fail on short prompts/long generations.

Method: A/I-GLASS uses rank-aggregation of prompt local statistics (activation-based) and model-intrinsic global statistics (impact-based) to dynamically select FFN units without training or auxiliary predictors.

Result: GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods across multiple LLMs and benchmarks, especially in challenging long-form generation scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed activation- and impact-based global-local aggregation approach provides effective training-free dynamic pruning for LLMs without inference overhead, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

TL;DR: Learning time-varying convex combinations of multiple fairness measures with limited graph-structured feedback


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to consider multiple fairness measures simultaneously with unknown and time-varying relative weights that must be learned adaptively

Method: Learning time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures using limited graph-structured feedback

Result: Not specified in the abstract

Conclusion: Proposes an approach for adaptively learning optimal combinations of multiple fairness constraints in dynamic environments

Abstract: There is an increasing appreciation that one may need to consider multiple
measures of fairness, e.g., considering multiple group and individual fairness
notions. The relative weights of the fairness regularisers are a priori
unknown, may be time varying, and need to be learned on the fly. We consider
the learning of time-varying convexifications of multiple fairness measures
with limited graph-structured feedback.

TL;DR: AIRL-S unifies RL and search-based test-time scaling by using the RL-learned reward function as an ideal process reward model for guiding search, eliminating need for labeled intermediate data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods have limitations: RL methods suffer from instability and low efficiency, while search-based methods require expensive labeled data and degrade under distribution shifts.

Method: Uses adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to learn dense, dynamic process reward models directly from correct reasoning traces without labeled intermediate data.

Result: Improves performance by 9% on average over base model across 8 benchmarks (mathematics, scientific reasoning, code generation), matching GPT-4o. Outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data when integrated into search algorithms.

Conclusion: The RL-learned reward function serves as the ideal process reward model for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution for complex reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

TL;DR: FedRAIN-Lite uses federated reinforcement learning with latitude-based agents to enable adaptive climate model parameter learning, showing DDPG outperforms static and single-agent baselines with better convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional climate model parameterizations are static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving climate states. There's a need for more adaptive, online learning approaches.

Method: Federated RL framework with agents assigned to latitude bands, tested on energy-balance climate model hierarchy (ebm-v1 to ebm-v3) using DDPG and other RL algorithms with periodic global aggregation.

Result: DDPG consistently outperformed static and single-agent baselines with faster convergence, lower RMSE in tropical/mid-latitude zones, and demonstrated good transferability across hyperparameters with low computational cost.

Conclusion: FedRAIN-Lite provides a scalable pathway for geographically adaptive parameter learning in climate models, offering a prototype for physically aligned online-learning models that can evolve with changing climate conditions.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a
changing climate. Code accessible at

*Nícolas Roque dos Santos,Dawon Ahn,Diego Minatel,Alneu de Andrade Lopes,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GCTD proposes tensor decomposition for graph condensation, achieving comparable performance to bi-level optimization methods with better interpretability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph condensation methods rely on computationally intensive bi-level optimization and lack interpretability due to missing node mapping between original and synthetic graphs.

Method: Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition (GCTD) uses tensor decomposition techniques to synthesize a smaller informative graph while maintaining performance.

Result: GCTD reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up to 4.0% accuracy improvement on 3 out of 6 datasets and competitive performance on large graphs.

Conclusion: Tensor decomposition offers an effective alternative to bi-level optimization for graph condensation, providing better interpretability and computational efficiency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeRC is an end-to-end neural framework that corrects GNSS ranging errors using ground-truth locations instead of hard-to-obtain error labels, achieving improved positioning accuracy in urban environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS localization on mobile devices suffers from accuracy issues in urban areas due to signal propagation complexity and low-quality hardware. Traditional data-driven methods require difficult-to-obtain ranging error annotations.

Method: Uses differentiable moving horizon estimation (MHE) to handle measurement horizons for positioning and backpropagate gradients. Employs Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps as a training paradigm to reduce dependency on labeled locations.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvement in positioning accuracy on public benchmarks and collected datasets. Successfully deployed on edge devices with verified real-time performance.

Conclusion: NeRC provides a practical end-to-end solution for GNSS error correction using easily obtainable ground-truth locations, overcoming annotation challenges while maintaining real-time performance on mobile devices.

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how graph structure affects learning algorithm performance in GNNs, focusing on excess risk and connecting spectral graph theory with SGD/Ridge regression performance across different graph types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing theoretical studies on GNN learning dynamics focus primarily on convergence rates under noise-free conditions and provide only crude connections to graph structure. This paper aims to bridge the gap by examining generalization performance with noise and establishing precise connections between graph structure and learning algorithm performance.

Method: The authors extend conventional learning theory settings to GNNs, derive excess risk profiles for SGD and Ridge regression, connect these to graph structure through spectral graph theory, and conduct comparative analysis across different graph structures (regular vs. power-law). They also extend analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs.

Result: The study reveals how different graph structures impact learning algorithm performance, shows increasing non-isotropic effects on excess risk in multi-layer GNNs, and provides new insights into the over-smoothing issue from a learning algorithm perspective. Empirical results validate theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates a coupling relationship among graph structure, GNNs, and learning algorithms, providing practical insights for GNN algorithm design and selection based on graph structural properties.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous cyber operations require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow convergence and poor early-stage performance. Teacher-guided techniques have shown promise in other domains but haven't been applied to cybersecurity.

Method: Implemented four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the simulated CybORG environment and conducted comparative evaluation.

Result: Teacher integration significantly improved training efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed.

Conclusion: Teacher-guided techniques show strong potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity operations by enhancing training efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow

demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,

TL;DR: A flow matching approach for poaching prediction that addresses imperfect detection through latent space occupancy modeling and data scarcity through composite flow initialization from linear models, showing improved accuracy in Ugandan national parks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Poaching threatens wildlife and biodiversity, and existing prediction methods lack expressivity for complex spatiotemporal patterns. Current generative models face challenges with imperfect detection and limited data in real-world poaching scenarios.

Method: Integrates flow matching with occupancy-based detection model to train flows in latent space for inferring underlying occupancy states. Uses composite flow initialized from linear-model predictions instead of random noise to inject prior knowledge and improve generalization.

Result: Evaluations on datasets from two Ugandan national parks demonstrate consistent gains in predictive accuracy compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses key challenges in poaching prediction by combining flow matching with occupancy modeling and prior knowledge injection, providing a more accurate forecasting method for conservation planning.

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First non-asymptotic convergence analysis for score-based graph generative models (SGGMs), revealing unique convergence factors and providing theoretical guidance for hyperparameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Score-based graph generative models are effective in drug discovery and protein synthesis, but their theoretical convergence behavior remains underexplored due to their complex coupled SDE structure that differs from standard SGMs.

Method: Theoretical convergence analysis across three graph generation paradigms: feature generation with fixed structure, structure generation with fixed features, and joint generation of both. Analysis considers unique SGGM-specific factors like topological properties.

Result: Identified unique convergence factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., graph topological properties), provided theoretical insights for hyperparameter selection, and validated findings through controlled empirical studies with synthetic graph models.

Conclusion: This work deepens theoretical understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains, and provides practical guidance for designing effective models with improved convergence properties.

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

TL;DR: SBGD model addresses scalability and size generalization issues in graph diffusion models by using block graph representations with structural priors, achieving 6x memory improvement while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph diffusion generative models face scalability challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and poor size generalization, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: Proposes stochastic block graph diffusion (SBGD) model that refines graph representations into block graph space with structural priors based on real-world patterns, reducing memory complexity.

Result: Achieves up to 6x memory improvements while maintaining comparable or superior graph generation performance, with better generalization to unseen graph sizes.

Conclusion: SBGD provides a scalable and effective solution for graph generation while exemplifying modularization principles in generative modeling through task decomposition.

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

TL;DR: DuPO is a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback through generalized duality, eliminating the need for costly labels and expanding beyond strictly dual task pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of RLVR (requires costly labels, limited to verifiable tasks) and traditional dual learning (restricted to strictly dual task pairs like translation tasks).

Method: Decomposes primal task input into known/unknown components, constructs dual task to reconstruct unknown parts using primal output and known information, uses reconstruction quality as self-supervised reward to optimize primal task via LLMs.

Result: Achieves 2.13 COMET improvement in translation over 756 directions, 6.4% accuracy boost in mathematical reasoning on three benchmarks, and 9.3 point improvement as inference-time reranker.

Conclusion: DuPO provides a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization that works across diverse non-invertible tasks.

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Motivation: To leverage large language models for simulating complex physiological systems, creating a digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care medicine.

Method: Multi-agent framework with LLM-driven agents modeling specific physiological systems, trained via supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data followed by reinforcement-guided coordination with dynamic reference selection and error correction.

Result: Achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients with per-system MSEs <0.16, robust across severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients showed moderate degradation but stable simulation. Physicians confirmed realism (mean Likert 3.9) and classifiers on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops (<0.04).

Conclusion: Organ-Agents is a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital twin for critical care applications, capable of faithfully reproducing multi-system physiological events and enabling counterfactual treatment simulations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital

*Kim Hammar,Tao Li*

TL;DR: MOBAL is an online Bayesian learning method for cyber incident response that refines attack models iteratively as new information arrives, enabling effective response planning even with initially inaccurate system models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional incident response frameworks require detailed system models, which limits their practical utility when attack information is incomplete or inaccurate during cyber incidents.

Method: MOBAL uses Bayesian learning to iteratively refine conjectures about the attack model as new information becomes available, then quantizes the conjectured model into a finite Markov model for efficient response planning via dynamic programming.

Result: The method proves Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with information feedback and establishes bounds on misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on CAGE-2 benchmark show MOBAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adaptability and robustness.

Conclusion: MOBAL provides an effective online approach for cyber incident response that handles model misspecification through iterative Bayesian learning and enables efficient response planning even with incomplete initial information.

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and

*Samarth Gupta,Raghudeep Gadde,Rui Chen,Aleix M. Martinez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that diffusion models require many latent states/time-steps, showing that careful noise schedule selection enables training with as few as 32 states (matching 1000-state performance) and even single latent-state models that can be combined for high-quality generation with 4-6x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the fundamental assumption that diffusion models require a large number of latent states or time-steps for effective training, aiming to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance.

Method: Careful selection of noise schedules and pushing the limit to single latent-state models (complete disentanglement in T-space), then combining independently trained single latent-state models for generation.

Result: Models trained with only 32 latent states match performance of those with 1000 states, and single latent-state models produce high-quality samples when combined, achieving 4-6x faster convergence across various metrics on two datasets.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can be effectively trained with significantly fewer latent states than traditionally assumed, enabling faster convergence and reduced computational requirements while maintaining sample quality.

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

*Ajan Subramanian,Amir M. Rahmani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for learning personalized counterfactual models from wearable sensor data to explore what-if scenarios and individual-specific outcomes of lifestyle choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable sensor data provides opportunities for personalized health monitoring, but deriving actionable insights from complex, longitudinal data streams is challenging. There's a need to understand individual-specific responses to lifestyle interventions.

Method: Augments individual datasets with similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis, uses temporal PC algorithm to discover predictive relationships, trains Gradient Boosting Machines to quantify individual-specific effects, and builds a counterfactual engine for projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical interventions.

Result: Achieved reasonable predictive accuracy (mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility (median 0.9643). Showed significant inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes.

Conclusion: The framework provides a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses about individual responses to lifestyle changes, demonstrating potential for personalized health insights from wearable data.

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

*Viktor Martinek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Improved symbolic regression benchmarking with curated expression lists and early termination, increasing rediscovery rates by 18% and reducing computation time by 41-63%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression benchmarks overemphasize recovering exact expression forms, rely solely on computer algebra systems for assessment, and continue searching after discovery, leading to inefficient evaluation.

Method: Introduces curated lists of acceptable expressions and a callback mechanism for early termination. Applied to SRSD benchmark problems to evaluate SymbolicRegression.jl and TiSR packages.

Result: SymbolicRegression.jl's rediscovery rate increased from 26.7% to 44.7% with 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR achieved 69.4% rediscovery rate with 63% time savings.

Conclusion: The new benchmarking approach significantly improves both rediscovery rates and computational efficiency for symbolic regression algorithms, providing a more effective evaluation framework.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

### [181] [On the notion of missingness for path attribution explainability methods in medical settings: Guiding the selection of medically meaningful baselines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14482)
*Alexander Geiger,Lars Wagner,Daniel Rueckert,Dirk Wilhelm,Alissa Jell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual-guided approach using VAE to generate meaningful baselines for medical image attribution, improving faithfulness and clinical relevance over standard baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard baseline choices like all-zero inputs are semantically meaningless in medical contexts where missingness itself can be informative, lacking principled dynamic baseline selection.

Method: Uses Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines representing clinically normal but input-close absence of features, with generative-model-agnostic approach.

Result: Evaluated on three medical datasets, counterfactual baselines yield more faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline choices.

Conclusion: Counterfactual-guided baseline selection provides more accurate representation of meaningful feature absence in medical data, improving interpretability for clinical trust.

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

*Huan Ma,Jiadong Pan,Jing Liu,Yan Chen,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Guangyu Wang,Qinghua Hu,Hua Wu,Changqing Zhang,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Semantic Energy is a new uncertainty estimation framework that improves hallucination detection in LLMs by using logits from the penultimate layer and Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, outperforming semantic entropy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are susceptible to hallucinations that produce fluent but incorrect responses, leading to erroneous decisions. Existing uncertainty estimation methods like semantic entropy rely on post-softmax probabilities and fail to capture the model's inherent uncertainty effectively.

Method: The authors introduce Semantic Energy, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent confidence by operating directly on logits of the penultimate layer. It combines semantic clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution to better capture uncertainty.

Result: Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Semantic Energy provides more reliable uncertainty signals for downstream applications like hallucination detection, addressing limitations of previous semantic entropy approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

### [183] [Exact Shapley Attributions in Quadratic-time for FANOVA Gaussian Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14499)
*Majid Mohammadi,Krikamol Muandet,Ilaria Tiddi,Annette Ten Teije,Siu Lun Chau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact Shapley values for FANOVA Gaussian processes can be computed in quadratic time instead of exponential time, enabling efficient local and global explanations with uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley values provide principled feature attribution but scale exponentially with features, making them impractical for real applications, especially with probabilistic models like GPs that require additional computational effort.

Method: Leverage FANOVA GP structure to define stochastic cooperative games and variance-based value functions, using closed-form Möbius representation and recursive algorithms inspired by Newton's identities for efficient computation.

Result: Exact Shapley values for both local (instance-wise) and global explanations can be computed in quadratic time, capturing expected contributions and uncertainty for probabilistic models.

Conclusion: This work enables scalable, axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for structured probabilistic models, significantly enhancing the practical utility of explainable AI.

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based anomaly detection method with multiscale feature perception for cloud services, achieving superior performance in precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation for anomaly detection in cloud service environments with high-dimensional monitoring data.

Method: Uses improved Transformer module with self-attention for temporal modeling, multiscale feature construction path with downsampling and parallel encoding, and attention-weighted fusion module for dynamic scale contribution adjustment.

Result: Outperforms mainstream baseline models in precision, recall, AUC, and F1-score, maintaining strong stability and detection performance under various perturbation conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates superior capability for anomaly detection in complex cloud environments with robust performance across different conditions.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

*Kevin Riehl,Shaimaa K. El-Baklish,Anastasios Kouvelas,Michail A. Makridis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Great GATsBi is a hybrid trajectory prediction framework for bicycles that combines physics-based and social-based modeling using graph attention networks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bicycles have received little attention in trajectory prediction research despite accounting for most traffic accident fatalities, while previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles.

Method: A hybrid multimodal framework incorporating physics-based modeling (inspired by vehicles) and social-based modeling (inspired by pedestrians) using graph attention networks with decayed historical and anticipated future trajectory data.

Result: The ensemble of physics models (good for short-term predictions) and social models (good for long-term predictions) exceeds state-of-the-art performance, validated through controlled mass-cycling experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses the dual nature of bicycle movement and demonstrates superior performance in forecasting bicycle trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

*Saman Yazdannik,Morteza Tayefi,Shamim Sanisales*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN) integrates Chebyshev polynomials into DQN framework, achieving 39% better performance than standard DQN on CartPole-v1 with optimal polynomial degree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard neural networks struggle to efficiently represent complex value functions in reinforcement learning. Chebyshev polynomials offer superior function approximation properties that could improve DQN performance.

Method: Proposed Ch-DQN architecture that replaces standard MLP with Chebyshev polynomial basis. Evaluated on CartPole-v1 benchmark with different polynomial degrees (N=4 and N=8) and compared against standard DQN with similar parameter count.

Result: Ch-DQN with moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieved approximately 39% better asymptotic performance than standard DQN baseline. However, higher degree (N=8) was detrimental to learning, showing polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter.

Conclusion: Orthogonal polynomial bases like Chebyshev polynomials show significant potential for improving deep reinforcement learning, but careful hyperparameter tuning of polynomial degree is essential to balance model complexity and performance.

Abstract: The performance of Deep Q-Networks (DQN) is critically dependent on the
ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

*Tao Shen,Zexi Li,Didi Zhu,Ziyu Zhao,Chao Wu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper identifies a new type of drift called 'period drift' in cross-device federated learning caused by partial client participation, and proposes FedEve framework to mitigate both period drift and client drift by making them compensate each other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in federated learning that causes poor convergence. While client drift from multiple local updates has been studied, period drift from partial client participation in cross-device FL has not been well investigated and can be more harmful as it shifts the optimization objective every round.

Method: Proposes a predict-observe framework and presents FedEve method that allows period drift and client drift to compensate each other, reducing the variance of model updates through theoretical mechanisms.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedEve outperforms alternative methods on non-iid data in cross-device federated learning settings, showing improved performance despite data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Period drift is a significant issue in cross-device FL that interacts with client drift, and the proposed FedEve framework effectively mitigates both types of drift by leveraging their compensatory relationship, leading to better performance on heterogeneous data distributions.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

### [188] [Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14544)
*Zixi Chen,Yinyu Ye,Zijie Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimizing LLM inference scheduling using ML-based output length prediction to minimize latency and prevent memory overflow, with an adaptive algorithm achieving log-scale competitive ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM inference is an online multi-task service that consumes significant energy, with unknown output lengths making scheduling challenging. Improving efficiency and reducing power consumption while handling high request volumes is crucial.

Method: Propose two algorithms: A_max (conservative approach using upper bound prediction) and A_min (adaptive algorithm using lower bound prediction with dynamic refinement during inference). A_min treats predicted lower bound as initial output length and adjusts estimates during processing.

Result: A_min achieves log-scale competitive ratio and performs nearly as well as hindsight scheduler in simulations. It shows efficiency and robustness, with advantage of relying only on lower bound predictions which are easier to estimate accurately than upper bounds.

Conclusion: The adaptive algorithm A_min effectively addresses output length uncertainty in LLM inference scheduling, providing near-optimal performance while being robust to prediction inaccuracies and computationally efficient.

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

TL;DR: A unified framework for distributed SGD algorithms with dynamic topologies and non-uniform aggregation that provides improved convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing distributed SGD approaches assume fixed topologies and uniform node contributions, which are suboptimal. Dynamic topologies with non-uniform aggregation can significantly improve performance.

Method: Develops a unified framework covering multiple Local-Update SGD-based distributed algorithms with dynamic topologies and non-uniform client selection strategies.

Result: The framework provides improved or matching theoretical convergence guarantees compared to existing work in distributed SGD settings.

Conclusion: Dynamic topologies and non-uniform aggregation strategies offer superior performance over traditional fixed-topology approaches in distributed machine learning training.

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study examines how different density-ratio estimation methods affect fairness measurement in ML regression, finding significant variations that can lead to inconsistent fairness assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research used logistic regression for fairness measurement in regression problems, but didn't investigate sensitivity to different density-ratio estimation algorithms, creating a research gap.

Method: Developed multiple fairness measurement methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and experimentally compared their effects on fairness outcomes.

Result: Different density-ratio estimation cores significantly affect fairness measurement results and can generate inconsistent conclusions about algorithm fairness.

Conclusion: Density-ratio estimation based fairness measurement in regression has major reliability issues, requiring further research to enhance consistency and trustworthiness.

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

TL;DR: DualNILM is a Transformer-based multi-task learning framework that simultaneously performs appliance state recognition and injected energy identification in NILM systems with behind-the-meter energy sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional NILM methods struggle with behind-the-meter energy sources (solar panels, battery storage) that obscure appliance power signatures and degrade performance.

Method: Deep multi-task learning framework combining sequence-to-point and sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer architecture to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in aggregate power consumption.

Result: Extensive experiments show DualNILM maintains excellent performance for both appliance state recognition and energy injection identification, significantly outperforming conventional methods.

Conclusion: DualNILM effectively addresses the challenge of behind-the-meter energy sources in NILM through a dual-task learning approach that captures complex temporal patterns in power consumption data.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper develops statistical methods to test for Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) violations in similarity choice data, finding significant violations across datasets and suggesting the need for new models that account for context effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Similarity choice data (e.g., information retrieval, embedding learning) often assume IIA, but this assumption has received little testing in similarity choice contexts due to the target-dependent nature of choices. The authors aim to systematically test IIA violations in this setting.

Method: Proposed two statistical tests: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian Posterior Predictive Check (PPC) approach to quantify IIA violation degree. Curated two datasets - one designed to elicit IIA violations and another with random choice sets from the same item universe.

Result: Significant IIA violations were found in both datasets with comparable violation degrees. A new PPC test for population homogeneity showed the population is homogeneous, indicating IIA violations are driven by context effects within choice sets rather than population heterogeneity.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate systematic IIA violations in similarity choice settings, highlighting the need for new similarity choice models that can account for context effects and interactions within choice sets.

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

### [193] [A Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI Framework for Flight Continuous Descent Operations Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14618)
*Amin Noroozi,Sandaruwan K. Sethunge,Elham Norouzi,Phat T. Phan,Kavinda U. Waduge,Md. Arafatur Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes FEXAI framework combining fuzzy logic with ML and SHAP analysis to identify key factors affecting Continuous Descent Operations performance and provide explainable rules for aviation decision support.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited research on factors influencing CDO performance despite its operational and environmental benefits, and lack of transparency in existing trajectory optimization methods which is critical for aviation safety and stakeholder trust.

Method: Collected comprehensive dataset from 1,094 flights with 29 features (11 operational, 18 weather-related) using ADS-B data. Applied ML models and SHAP analysis to classify CDO adherence and rank feature importance, then built fuzzy rule-based classifier using top 3 features.

Result: All models achieved >90% classification accuracy. Identified average descent rate, number of descent segments, and average change in directional heading as strongest CDO performance predictors. FEXAI provided meaningful human-readable rules.

Conclusion: FEXAI presents a novel pathway for operational decision support that could be integrated into aviation tools for real-time advisories to maintain CDO adherence under varying conditions.

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

*Luis H. John,Jan A. Kors,Jenna M. Reps,Peter R. Rijnbeek,Egill A. Fridgeirsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using hyperbolic embeddings from SNOMED taxonomy improves lung cancer prediction models by preserving semantic relationships between medical concepts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clinical prediction models ignore semantic relationships between clinical concepts. This study aims to improve prediction by incorporating domain-specific semantic information from medical hierarchies.

Method: Mapped SNOMED medical term hierarchy into hyperbolic space using Poincaré embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. Incorporated these embeddings into ResNet and Transformer models for lung cancer onset prediction.

Result: Poincaré embeddings provided modest but consistent improvements in discrimination performance. ResNet models with 10-dimensional embeddings showed enhanced calibration, while Transformers maintained stable calibration.

Conclusion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space improves prediction by preserving hierarchical structure, demonstrating a feasible method to combine data-driven feature extraction with clinical knowledge.

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

*Haoru Tan,Sitong Wu,Xiuzhe Wu,Wang Wang,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Gui-Song Xia,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diff-In: A scalable second-order method for estimating sample influence in neural networks without convexity assumptions, achieving high accuracy with computational efficiency comparable to first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data analysis tools for AI model training often lack accuracy and make unrealistic assumptions like convex loss functions, making current methods difficult to implement effectively.

Method: Proposes Diff-In formulation that approximates sample influence by accumulating differences between consecutive learning steps using second-order approximations, eliminating convexity requirements while maintaining computational efficiency through Hessian-gradient product approximation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows significantly lower approximation error than existing influence estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets in data cleaning, deletion, and coreset selection tasks, scaling to millions of data points in large-scale vision-language pre-training.

Conclusion: Diff-In provides an accurate, scalable solution for sample influence estimation in non-convex neural networks, outperforming existing methods while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to first-order approaches.

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

TL;DR: ELATE uses evolutionary framework with language model to automate time-series feature engineering, improving forecasting accuracy by 8.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual feature engineering is time-intensive and existing automation methods are computationally expensive without domain insights

Method: Evolutionary framework with language model that uses time-series statistical measures and feature importance to guide and prune features, while proposing contextually relevant transformations

Result: Improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various domains

Conclusion: ELATE successfully automates feature engineering for time-series data with significant performance improvements

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

*Zengyi Wo,Chang Liu,Yumeng Wang,Minglai Shao,Wenjun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fair-ICD: A counterfactual data augmentation approach for mitigating bias in Graph Neural Networks while maintaining predictive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs can exhibit bias based on sensitive attributes like race and gender, which is exacerbated by graph structure and message-passing mechanisms. Existing bias mitigation methods may unintentionally remove non-sensitive features, compromising the balance between accuracy and fairness.

Method: Uses counterfactual data augmentation to create diverse neighborhoods before message passing, enabling unbiased node representation learning. Combines this with an adversarial discriminator to reduce bias in GNN classifier predictions.

Result: Experiments on standard datasets with three GNN backbones show significant improvements in fairness metrics while preserving high predictive performance.

Conclusion: Fair-ICD effectively addresses bias in GNNs through counterfactual augmentation and adversarial learning, achieving better fairness-accuracy trade-offs compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

### [198] [Addressing Graph Anomaly Detection via Causal Edge Separation and Spectrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14684)
*Zengyi Wo,Wenjun Wang,Minglai Shao,Chang Liu,Yumeng Wang,Yueheng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CES2-GAD, a spectral neural network using causal edge separation for anomaly detection on heterophilic graphs where anomalous nodes hide connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN-based anomaly detection methods fail on heterophilic graphs where anomalous entities add legitimate connections while hiding direct anomalous links, and spectral domain solutions are limited.

Method: Separates graph into homophilic/heterophilic edges using causal interventions, applies hybrid-spectrum filters to capture signals from segmented graphs, and concatenates representations for classification.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CES2-GAD method.

Conclusion: The spectral approach with causal edge separation successfully addresses heterophilic anomaly detection by capturing shifted spectral energy patterns in anomalous nodes.

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AFABench is the first standardized benchmark framework for Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) that enables fair evaluation of different feature selection methods across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AFA methods lack standardized evaluation due to the absence of comprehensive benchmarks, making it difficult to compare performance and understand trade-offs between different approaches.

Method: Developed AFABench with synthetic and real-world datasets, implemented representative algorithms from static, greedy, and reinforcement learning categories, and created AFAContext dataset to test lookahead capabilities.

Result: The benchmark provides systematic evaluation of AFA methods, reveals key trade-offs between strategies, and exposes limitations of greedy selection approaches through the novel AFAContext dataset.

Conclusion: AFABench enables fair comparison of AFA methods, provides insights for future research, and serves as a foundation for standardized evaluation in active feature acquisition.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Motivation: Existing graph structure refinement methods are unsuitable for novel, dataset-less graphs generated by LLMs for visual tasks like video anomaly detection, creating a need for data-driven optimization approaches.

Method: Proposed MissionHD framework using hyperdimensional computing with an efficient encode-decode process to refine graph structures, guided by downstream task signals without requiring additional datasets.

Result: Experiments on challenging video anomaly detection and video anomaly recognition benchmarks show significant performance improvements when using the refined graphs.

Conclusion: D-GSR with MissionHD provides an effective pre-processing step that successfully aligns LLM-generated reasoning graphs with downstream visual tasks, validating the data-driven graph refinement paradigm.

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating

TL;DR: CMCM-DLM enables cross-modality constrained molecule generation using a pre-trained diffusion model with trainable structure and property control modules, eliminating the need for retraining when constraints change.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SMILES-based diffusion models only support unimodal constraints and require complete retraining for new constraints, but real-world drug discovery needs multiple cross-modality constraints that may emerge during studies.

Method: Builds on pre-trained diffusion model with two trainable modules: Structure Control Module (SCM) for early diffusion steps to anchor molecular backbone, and Property Control Module (PCM) for later inference stages to refine chemical properties. Operates in two phases during generation.

Result: Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate efficiency and adaptability, showing significant advancement in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM successfully enables cross-modality constrained molecule generation without retraining, providing a flexible framework that can incorporate new constraints as they emerge during drug discovery studies.

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

TL;DR: HERAKLES is a hierarchical autotelic framework that compiles mastered goals into low-level policies and uses an LLM as high-level controller to handle evolving goal complexity in open-ended environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended AI agents need to efficiently learn increasingly complex and heterogeneous goals while controlling computational complexity growth, but existing approaches rely on expert-defined subgoals and pre-trained policies which are inadequate for dynamic scenarios.

Method: Two-level hierarchical architecture where mastered goals are continuously compiled into a small, fast low-level neural network policy, while a Large Language Model serves as high-level controller for goal decomposition and generalization over the evolving subgoal space.

Result: HERAKLES scales effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill compilation, and enables robust adaptation to novel challenges in the Crafter environment.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses open-ended learning challenges by dynamically expanding subgoal spaces and leveraging LLM capabilities for hierarchical control, demonstrating effective scaling and adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

TL;DR: PepThink-R1 is a novel generative framework that combines large language models with chain-of-thought reasoning and reinforcement learning to design therapeutic peptides with improved properties and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current peptide design faces challenges including vast sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor interpretability of generative models, making therapeutic peptide optimization difficult.

Method: Integrates LLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, explicitly reasoning about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation with tailored reward functions for chemical validity and property optimization.

Result: Generates cyclic peptides with significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming both general LLMs (like GPT-5) and domain-specific baselines in optimization success and interpretability.

Conclusion: First LLM-based peptide design framework combining explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control, representing a step toward reliable and transparent peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

*Ahmed Mujtaba,Gleb Radchenko,Radu Prodan,Marc Masana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EdgeFD is a resource-efficient federated distillation method that uses KMeans-based density ratio estimation to filter proxy data on clients, eliminating complex statistical estimators and server-side filtering while maintaining high accuracy across diverse data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated distillation methods use computationally expensive statistical density ratio estimators for selective knowledge sharing and require server-side filtering, which introduces latency and complexity.

Method: Proposes EdgeFD with efficient KMeans-based density ratio estimator to filter both in-distribution and out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, removing need for server-side filtering and pre-trained teacher models.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy close to IID scenarios under heterogeneous conditions (strong/weak non-IID, IID) with significantly reduced computational overhead suitable for edge devices.

Conclusion: EdgeFD enhances scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation through efficient client-side processing, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

*Guillermo Sarasa Durán,Ana Granados Fontecha,Francisco de Borja Rodríguez Ortíz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Context steering actively guides compression-based distance features to align with specific tasks, improving clustering/classification performance by generating tailored embeddings that amplify class-distinctive information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compression-based distances provide flexible similarity measurement but often fail to align with specific tasks because features emerge from data rather than being defined for the task. This makes them suboptimal for complex clustering and classification settings.

Method: Introduces 'context steering' methodology that actively guides feature-shaping process by systematically analyzing how each object influences relational context within clustering framework. Uses Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with hierarchical clustering.

Result: Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets (text and audio) validate the robustness and generality of context steering, showing improved performance over passive approaches.

Conclusion: Context steering represents a fundamental shift from merely discovering inherent data structures to actively shaping feature spaces tailored to specific objectives, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

TL;DR: Novel adaptive distillation framework using loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized teacher-student interface for efficient model compression


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional model distillation approaches suffer from computational overhead and limited generalization, making deployment in resource-constrained environments challenging

Method: Dynamic data augmentation in high-loss regions using UMAP dimensionality reduction and nearest neighbor sampling, plus lightweight teacher-student interface that bypasses teacher's input layer for direct distillation on vectorized representations

Result: 66M-parameter student model achieves 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3% on SST-2, matching or surpassing established baselines with fewer training epochs

Conclusion: Loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation show promise for efficient and effective model compression

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

*Azim Ahmadzadeh,Rohan Adhyapak,Armin Iraji,Kartik Chaurasiya,V Aparna,Petrus C. Martens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A practical guide for managing complex manual image annotation projects, focusing on scientific imagery and addressing challenges from data collection to bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high demand for manually annotated image data combined with the lack of practical guidelines for managing complex annotation projects, which require dealing with diverse challenges outside typical domain expertise.

Method: Drawing from extensive experience managing large manual annotation projects, the paper provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide covering success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data availability, team roles, human biases, and recommended tools/technologies.

Result: A comprehensive framework and practical guidelines for improving annotation quality and efficiency in manual annotation projects.

Conclusion: The paper aims to encourage further research and development of comprehensive knowledge bases to reduce costs of manual annotation projects across various fields.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

*Zifan Wang,Alice Harting,Matthieu Barreau,Michael M. Zavlanos,Karl H. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGFM modifies source distribution instead of vector field for guidance, enabling flexible sampling methods while preserving exact target distribution recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional guidance methods modify probability flow vector fields, which can be complex and restrictive. SGFM aims to simplify guidance by working directly with source distributions while maintaining theoretical guarantees.

Method: Source-Guided Flow Matching framework that keeps pre-trained vector field intact and modifies source distribution. Uses various sampling methods for the source distribution and preserves straight transport maps.

Result: Theoretical proof of exact target distribution recovery. Bounds on Wasserstein error for approximate implementations. Experimental validation on 2D benchmarks, image datasets, and physics-informed tasks shows effectiveness.

Conclusion: SGFM provides a flexible, theoretically sound framework for generative model guidance that integrates well with optimal flow matching models and allows users to choose appropriate sampling methods for their specific problems.

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

*Chen-Hao Chang,Hui-Ju Hung,Chia-Hsun Lu,Chih-Ya Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper addresses the lack of theoretical analysis and inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning for link prediction, proposing a new Edge Balancing Augmentation method and contrastive learning framework that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by two major weaknesses in existing contrastive learning approaches for link prediction: 1) the lack of formal theoretical analysis, and 2) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning frameworks.

Method: The authors provide the first formal theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, then propose Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA) to adjust node degrees as graph augmentation. They develop Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA) that integrates EBA with new contrastive losses.

Result: Experiments on 8 benchmark datasets demonstrate that CoEBA significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Conclusion: The proposed CoEBA framework successfully addresses the identified weaknesses in existing contrastive learning approaches for link prediction, providing both theoretical grounding and practical performance improvements through careful consideration of node degree balancing.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive Successive Halving using Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes shows competitive performance but isn't Pareto optimal compared to standard approach due to requiring fully observed learning curves as training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Successive Halving may prematurely prune slow-starting hyperparameter candidates that could eventually become the best performers, based on intermediate performance values alone.

Method: Using Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes to predict learning curves and guide Successive Halving resource allocation decisions, compared against standard performance-based approach.

Result: Predictive approach achieves competitive performance but is not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard approach, due to requirement for fully observed learning curves as training data.

Conclusion: While predictive Successive Halving shows promise, its limitation of requiring complete learning curve data could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve datasets.

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Amortized Model Ensembling (AME), a data-free method for averaging neural network weights from multiple pretrained models trained on disjoint data, outperforming both individual models and model soup baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled definition and method for neural averaging - synthesizing a single neural network from multiple pretrained models without access to training data, building on insights from model soup techniques.

Method: Proposes Amortized Model Ensembling (AME), a data-free meta-optimization approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural weight updates, generalizing model soup as a special case.

Result: AME produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual expert models and model soup baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled and generalizable framework for data-free model weight aggregation, defining how to perform neural averaging effectively.

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately predicting enzyme functionality is challenging, especially for enzymes with limited structural annotations or sequence homology, requiring more advanced computational approaches.

Method: Multimodal Quantum Machine Learning framework integrating four biochemical modalities: protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations using Quantum Vision Transformer with modality-specific encoders and cross-attention fusion.

Result: The multimodal QVT model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.1%, substantially outperforming sequence-only baselines and showing better performance compared to other QML models.

Conclusion: The integration of multiple biochemical modalities through quantum machine learning effectively captures stereoelectronic interactions critical for enzyme function prediction, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurately predicting enzyme functionality remains one of the major
challenges in computational biology, particularly for enzymes with limited
structural annotations or sequence homology. We present a novel multimodal
Quantum Machine Learning (QML) framework that enhances Enzyme Commission (EC)
classification by integrating four complementary biochemical modalities:
protein sequence embeddings, quantum-derived electronic descriptors, molecular
graph structures, and 2D molecular image representations. Quantum Vision
Transformer (QVT) backbone equipped with modality-specific encoders and a
unified cross-attention fusion module. By integrating graph features and
spatial patterns, our method captures key stereoelectronic interactions behind

substantial margin and achieving better performance results compared to other
QML models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an intrinsic optimization method using exponentiated gradient descent with Bregman projection to create effective jailbreak suffixes for LLMs, achieving higher success rates than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks despite alignment techniques like RLHF. Existing methods are inefficient in discrete token spaces or suffer from reduced effectiveness when projecting continuous embeddings back to discrete tokens for proprietary models.

Method: Directly optimizes relaxed one-hot encodings of adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring optimized encodings remain within the probability simplex.

Result: Achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to three state-of-the-art baselines on five open-source LLMs and four adversarial behavior datasets. Also generates universal adversarial suffixes effective across multiple prompts with transferability to different LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed intrinsic optimization method provides an effective approach for jailbreaking LLMs with theoretical convergence guarantees, outperforming existing methods while handling the challenges of discrete token optimization for both open-source and proprietary models.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

TL;DR: GTGIB integrates Graph Structure Learning with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck to handle dynamic networks with evolving nodes and edges, achieving superior performance in both inductive and transductive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in temporal graph learning where nodes and edges evolve over time, particularly representing unseen nodes and handling noisy/redundant graph information in dynamic networks.

Method: Proposes GTGIB framework combining Graph Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). Uses a two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to optimize node neighborhoods and extends information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs with variational approximation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on all four real-world datasets in inductive setting, with significant and consistent improvement in transductive setting for link prediction tasks.

Conclusion: GTGIB effectively handles temporal graph learning challenges through integrated structure learning and information bottleneck principles, demonstrating superior performance across different evaluation settings.

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

*Jyotirmai Singh,Samar Khanna,James Burgess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM) introduce anisotropic noise scaling along data's principal components, improving FID by up to 15% on image datasets without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise that ignores data structure. Inspired by quantum squeezed states and Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the authors hypothesize that data-dependent noise scaling can better help models learn important features.

Method: Two configurations: (1) Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates scaling on principal axis with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions, (2) Standard SDM variant that scales only the principal axis. Applied mild antisqueezing (increasing variance on principal axis).

Result: On CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing consistently improved FID by up to 15% and shifted precision-recall frontier toward higher recall.

Conclusion: Simple, data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative performance gains without requiring architectural modifications to diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

TL;DR: Study on compute-optimal scaling for online value-based deep RL, examining trade-offs between model capacity and update-to-data ratio under fixed compute budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model training becomes more expensive, there's a need for compute-optimal scaling in reinforcement learning (similar to language modeling), but RL scaling has received less attention despite its importance.

Method: Investigated compute scaling for online value-based deep RL by analyzing the interplay between model size, batch size, and update-to-data (UTD) ratio under fixed compute constraints.

Result: Identified TD-overfitting phenomenon where large batch sizes harm Q-function accuracy in small models but not in large models, enabling effective use of large batch sizes at scale.

Conclusion: Provided guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD ratio to optimize compute usage, establishing a foundation for compute-optimal scaling in deep RL similar to supervised learning but adapted to TD learning.

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

Motivation: Current TTS models primarily focus on English and European languages, limiting access to information for speakers of Indic languages. This creates a need for specialized multilingual TTS systems for Indian languages.

Method: Uses Wav2Vec2.0 tokens for semantic extraction, a Language Model for text-to-semantic modeling, and a Conditional Flow Model for semantics to melspectrogram generation. Trained on approximately 20K hours of Indian language data.

Conclusion: MahaTTS-v2 successfully addresses the multilingual challenge in TTS by providing high-quality speech synthesis for Indic languages, making information more accessible to speakers of these languages.

Abstract: Current Text-to-Speech models pose a multilingual challenge, where most of
the models traditionally focus on English and European languages, thereby
hurting the potential to provide access to information to many more people. To
address this gap, we introduce MahaTTS-v2 a Multilingual Multi-speaker

*Taous Iatariene,Alexandre Guérin,Romain Serizel*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Proposes knowledge distillation training for short-context speaker embeddings to improve identity reassignment in tracking systems, using beamforming to reduce overlap and enable blockwise processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speaker embedding extractors struggle with short temporal contexts and overlapping speech, which negatively impacts identity reassignment in tracking systems when using longer contexts.

Method: Knowledge distillation based training approach for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures, leveraging spatial information through beamforming to reduce overlap, and studying blockwise identity reassignment.

Result: Distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and more robust to overlap, but blockwise reassignment indicates need for better handling of simultaneous speech.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge distillation approach shows promise for short-context speaker embedding extraction, though further work is needed to effectively handle simultaneous speech in blockwise identity reassignment.

Abstract: Speaker embeddings are promising identity-related features that can enhance
the identity assignment performance of a tracking system by leveraging its
spatial predictions, i.e, by performing identity reassignment. Common speaker
embedding extractors usually struggle with short temporal contexts and
overlapping speech, which imposes long-term identity reassignment to exploit
longer temporal contexts. However, this increases the probability of tracking
system errors, which in turn impacts negatively on identity reassignment. To
address this, we propose a Knowledge Distillation (KD) based training approach
for short context speaker embedding extraction from two speaker mixtures. We
leverage the spatial information of the speaker of interest using beamforming
to reduce overlap. We study the feasibility of performing identity reassignment
over blocks of fixed size, i.e., blockwise identity reassignment, to go towards
a low-latency speaker embedding based tracking system. Results demonstrate that
our distilled models are effective at short-context embedding extraction and
more robust to overlap. Although, blockwise reassignment results indicate that
further work is needed to handle simultaneous speech more effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion recognition from speech requires capturing both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with applications in human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent LLMs show potential for multimodal tasks beyond natural language.

Method: Extracts audio features, maps them to LLM representation space via learnable interface, combines with text transcripts and task prompts. Uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs on standard benchmarks while requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches.

Conclusion: Effective integration of multimodal inputs for speech-based emotion understanding with significant computational efficiency.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing
both linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in
human-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have
highlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks
outside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches
have investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained
backbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach
that fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion
prediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature
extractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a
learnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio
features, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the
transcript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task.
To efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental
results on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model
outperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while
requiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This
highlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for
speech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: SI-SDR training with noisy references in speech separation leads to noise in outputs; proposed reference enhancement method reduces noise but may introduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem that using SI-SDR with noisy training references in supervised speech separation limits achievable performance and causes undesired noise in outputs.

Method: Proposed method to enhance references and augment mixtures with WHAM! to train models that avoid learning noisy references, then evaluated with NISQA.v2 metric.

Result: Reduced noise in separated speech but processing references may introduce artifacts, limiting overall quality gains. Negative correlation found between SI-SDR and perceived noisiness.

Conclusion: SI-SDR with noisy references has fundamental limitations; reference enhancement helps reduce noise but may introduce other quality issues, showing the trade-offs in speech separation training objectives.

Abstract: This paper examines the implications of using the Scale-Invariant
Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SI-SDR) as both evaluation and training objective
in supervised speech separation, when the training references contain noise, as
is the case with the de facto benchmark WSJ0-2Mix. A derivation of the SI-SDR
with noisy references reveals that noise limits the achievable SI-SDR, or leads
to undesired noise in the separated outputs. To address this, a method is
proposed to enhance references and augment the mixtures with WHAM!, aiming to
train models that avoid learning noisy references. Two models trained on these
enhanced datasets are evaluated with the non-intrusive NISQA.v2 metric. Results
show reduced noise in separated speech but suggest that processing references
may introduce artefacts, limiting overall quality gains. Negative correlation
is found between SI-SDR and perceived noisiness across models on the WSJ0-2Mix
and Libri2Mix test sets, underlining the conclusion from the derivation.

### [223] [Non-Dissipative Graph Propagation for Non-Local Community Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14097)
*William Leeney,Alessio Gravina,Davide Bacciu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: uAGNN is an unsupervised graph neural network that uses antisymmetric weight matrices to enable long-range information propagation for effective community detection in heterophilic graphs where similar nodes are distantly connected.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph neural networks struggle with community detection in heterophilic graphs because they rely on local message passing, which fails when nodes in the same community are distantly connected and need long-range information propagation.

Method: The Unsupervised Antisymmetric Graph Neural Network (uAGNN) employs non-dissipative dynamical systems with antisymmetric weight matrices to ensure stability and effectively propagate long-range information while capturing both local and global graph structures.

Result: Extensive experiments across ten datasets show uAGNN achieves superior performance in high and medium heterophilic settings where traditional methods fail, demonstrating its ability to exploit long-range dependencies effectively.

Conclusion: uAGNN proves to be a powerful unsupervised tool for community detection in diverse graph environments, particularly overcoming the limitations of heterophilic scenarios through effective long-range information propagation.

Abstract: Community detection in graphs aims to cluster nodes into meaningful groups, a
task particularly challenging in heterophilic graphs, where nodes sharing
similarities and membership to the same community are typically distantly
connected. This is particularly evident when this task is tackled by graph
neural networks, since they rely on an inherently local message passing scheme
to learn the node representations that serve to cluster nodes into communities.
In this work, we argue that the ability to propagate long-range information
during message passing is key to effectively perform community detection in
heterophilic graphs. To this end, we introduce the Unsupervised Antisymmetric
Graph Neural Network (uAGNN), a novel unsupervised community detection approach
leveraging non-dissipative dynamical systems to ensure stability and to
propagate long-range information effectively. By employing antisymmetric weight
matrices, uAGNN captures both local and global graph structures, overcoming the
limitations posed by heterophilic scenarios. Extensive experiments across ten
datasets demonstrate uAGNN's superior performance in high and medium
heterophilic settings, where traditional methods fail to exploit long-range
dependencies. These results highlight uAGNN's potential as a powerful tool for
unsupervised community detection in diverse graph environments.

### [224] [No More Marching: Learning Humanoid Locomotion for Short-Range SE(2) Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14098)
*Pranay Dugar,Mohitvishnu S. Gadde,Jonah Siekmann,Yesh Godse,Aayam Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning approach for humanoid locomotion that directly optimizes for SE(2) target poses using a constellation-based reward function, outperforming standard velocity-tracking methods in energy efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing humanoid locomotion methods focus on velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in inefficient marching-style behavior for short-range tasks in real-world workspaces.

Method: Developed a reinforcement learning approach with a novel constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient target-oriented movement, evaluated through a benchmarking framework measuring energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count.

Result: The proposed approach consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from simulation to hardware, demonstrating superior energy efficiency and performance on SE(2) goals.

Conclusion: Targeted reward design is crucial for practical short-range humanoid locomotion, and the constellation-based reward function enables more natural and efficient movement to target poses compared to traditional velocity-tracking approaches.

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

### [225] [Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100)
*Nilay Kushawaha,Carlo Alessi,Lorenzo Fruzzetti,Egidio Falotico*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A domain translation framework using conditional cycle GAN enables knowledge transfer between different physical domains for soft robots, allowing controllers trained in one environment to adapt to domains with significantly different properties like increased viscosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robots face challenges with material degradation over time and the inability to transfer learned mappings between domains with different physical properties, requiring adaptable controllers that can handle changing conditions.

Method: Uses conditional cycle generative adversarial network (CCGAN) to learn domain translation from pressure signals conditioned on end-effector positions/orientations, enabling transfer from source to target domains with different physical properties.

Result: Successfully adapted pose controller from standard simulation to domain with 10x increased viscosity, demonstrated effective trajectory tracking across five shapes, and showed robustness to noise perturbations and periodicity tests.

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP framework effectively enables cross-domain skill transfer for soft robotics, providing a pathway for more adaptable and generalizable controllers that can handle changing physical properties over time.

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimGenHOI is a unified framework combining generative modeling and reinforcement learning to generate physically realistic humanoid-object interactions by predicting key actions with Diffusion Transformers and refining them with a contact-aware control policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI generation approaches suffer from artifacts like implausible contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which prevent successful execution in physical environments.

Method: Uses Diffusion Transformers to predict key actions conditioned on text prompts, object geometry, sparse waypoints, and initial pose. Interpolates actions into smooth trajectories. Employs contact-aware whole-body control policy trained with RL to track motions and correct artifacts. Uses mutual fine-tuning strategy where generative model and control policy iteratively refine each other.

Result: Generates realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions with significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation, enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: SimGenHOI successfully addresses physical realism challenges in HOI generation through the synergistic combination of generative modeling and reinforcement learning with iterative refinement.

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLM agents evaluated for multi-agent coordination in victim rescue tasks, showing capabilities but also revealing failure modes in physically grounded collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Large Language Models can support effective collaboration in multi-agent settings for complex, real-world problems requiring coordination.

Method: Systematic evaluation of LLM agents in a structured victim rescue task within a fully known graph-based environment, using coordination-sensitive metrics including task success rate, redundant actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency.

Result: The study provides insights into both the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded multi-agent collaboration tasks.

Conclusion: This research contributes to future benchmarks and architectural improvements for LLM-based multi-agent coordination systems.

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DTWIL is a novel imitation learning method that addresses action constraints by aligning expert trajectories with constrained imitator trajectories using Dynamic Time Warping and Model Predictive Control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy learning under action constraints is crucial for safe robot behaviors, but existing imitation learning methods struggle when the imitator has a smaller action space than the expert, causing occupancy measure mismatch.

Method: Proposes DTWIL that performs trajectory alignment via Model Predictive Control using Dynamic Time Warping distance to create surrogate datasets that follow similar state trajectories while respecting action constraints.

Result: Extensive experiments show DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks and outperforms benchmark imitation learning algorithms in sample efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed trajectory alignment approach effectively addresses the action constraint mismatch problem in imitation learning, enabling safer and more efficient policy learning from constrained demonstrations.

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes using dynamics representation pre-training to enhance offline imitation learning with limited expert data by leveraging non-expert data and theoretical justification of optimal decision space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited expert data is a major bottleneck in scaling offline imitation learning. The paper aims to overcome this limitation by reusing massive non-expert data through dynamics representation learning.

Method: Introduces a pre-training stage that learns dynamics representations from factorizations of transition dynamics. Uses noise contrastive estimation inspired loss function. Theoretical justification shows optimal decision variable lies in representation space.

Result: Experiments on MuJoCo show ability to mimic expert policies with as few as one trajectory. Real quadrupeds experiments demonstrate leveraging pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn walking from few real-world demonstrations.

Conclusion: Dynamics representation pre-training effectively mitigates limited data issues in offline imitation learning, enabling successful learning from minimal expert demonstrations by leveraging non-expert data and theoretical insights.

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

*Dangfeng Pan,Zhensu Sun,Cenyuan Zhang,David Lo,Xiaoning Du*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code formatting elements (indentation, newlines) don't benefit LLMs and increase computational costs. Removing them reduces tokens by 24.5% without performance loss, making it an effective optimization strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual code formatting aids human readability but appears unnecessary for LLMs, potentially increasing computational costs and response times without benefits for AI processing.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across 4 programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C#) and 10 LLMs, analyzing token count and performance with/without formatting elements.

Result: LLMs maintain equivalent performance on formatted vs unformatted code, achieving average 24.5% input token reduction with negligible output token reductions. Prompting and fine-tuning can reduce output code length by up to 36.1% without compromising correctness.

Conclusion: Code format removal is a practical optimization strategy for LLM efficiency. A bidirectional code transformation tool was developed to integrate format processing into LLM workflows, balancing human readability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines
to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not
seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since
the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these
additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response
times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can
reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played
by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate
the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through
large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four
programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both
commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and
performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that
LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,
achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output
token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization
strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both
prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to
36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate
practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for
format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM
inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.

TL;DR: RealDevWorld is a novel evaluation framework that automatically assesses LLMs' ability to generate production-ready software through GUI-based interaction simulation and comprehensive testing, achieving 92% accuracy compared to human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to evaluate production-ready software generated by LLMs because they rely on static checks and binary pass/fail scripts, missing the interactive behaviors and runtime dynamics that define real-world usability.

Method: The framework consists of two components: (1) RealDevBench - 194 diverse software engineering tasks with multimodal elements, and (2) AppEvalPilot - an agent-as-a-judge system that simulates GUI-based user interactions to assess functional correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior.

Result: RealDevWorld achieves 0.92 accuracy and 0.85 correlation with expert human assessments, significantly reducing reliance on manual review while providing fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software generated by LLMs, bridging the gap in current evaluation methods by capturing interactive behaviors that only emerge during actual application usage.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and code agents in software development are
rapidly evolving from generating isolated code snippets to producing
full-fledged software applications with graphical interfaces, interactive
logic, and dynamic behaviors. However, current benchmarks fall short in
evaluating such production-ready software, as they often rely on static checks
or binary pass/fail scripts, failing to capture the interactive behaviors and
runtime dynamics that define real-world usability - qualities that only emerge
when an application is actively used. This is the blind spot of current
evaluation: you don't know if an app works until you click through it, interact
with it, and observe how it responds. To bridge this gap, we introduce
RealDevWorld, a novel evaluation framework for automated end-to-end assessment
of LLMs' ability to generate production-ready repositories from scratch. It
features two key components: (1) RealDevBench, a diverse collection of 194
open-ended software engineering tasks across multiple domains, incorporating
multimodal elements to reflect real-world complexity; and (2) AppEvalPilot, a
new agent-as-a-judge evaluation system that simulates realistic, GUI-based user
interactions to automatically and holistically assess software functional
correctness, visual fidelity, and runtime behavior. The framework delivers
fine-grained, task-specific diagnostic feedback, supporting nuanced evaluation
beyond simple success/failure judgments. Empirical results show that
RealDevWorld delivers effective, automatic, and human-aligned evaluations,
achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a correlation of 0.85 with expert human
assessments, while significantly reducing the reliance on manual review. This
enables scalable, human-aligned assessment of production-level software
generated by LLMs. Our code is available on GitHub.

Motivation: Natural language specifications for coding tasks are often ambiguous, requiring programmers to develop skills to recognize and resolve these ambiguities through clarifying questions.

Method: Developed a prototype system using ARHF (Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback) technique that suggests ambiguous inputs, seeks limited human feedback about desired behavior, and uses this feedback to generate resolved code.

Conclusion: The research discusses implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education, suggesting potential benefits for teaching ambiguity resolution skills.

Abstract: Specifications for code writing tasks are usually expressed in natural

to recognize ambiguities in task specifications and resolve them by asking
clarifying questions. We present and evaluate a prototype system, based on a
novel technique (ARHF: Ambiguity Resolution with Human Feedback), that (1)
suggests specific inputs on which a given task specification may be ambiguous,
(2) seeks limited human feedback about the code's desired behavior on those
inputs, and (3) uses this feedback to generate code that resolves these
ambiguities. We evaluate the efficacy of our prototype, and we discuss the
implications of such assistive systems on Computer Science education.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes structural entropy metrics using AST analysis to measure code generation stability from LLMs without requiring reference implementations or execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable stability assessment of LLM-generated code in real-world development, beyond traditional metrics like pass@k or BLEU that require references or execution.

Method: Extends structural-entropy concepts to programs by analyzing AST depth-bounded subtrees, measuring stability via Jensen-Shannon divergence and Structural Cross-Entropy ratio with structural-only and token-aware variants.

Result: Benchmarks show AST-driven structural entropy reveals nuances in model consistency and robustness across leading LLMs on standard code generation tasks.

Conclusion: Provides lightweight, reference-free, language-agnostic metrics that run in O(n,d) time, offering valuable addition to code-generation evaluation toolkit.

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

*Dennis Schiese,Andreas Both*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-powered debugging approach that uses process data and generative AI to create natural-language explanations, helping developers understand system behavior and errors more efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual debugging remains resource-intensive and archaic, especially for complex distributed systems. The authors aim to automate and improve debugging processes.

Method: Uses system process data combined with generative AI to generate natural-language explanations from actual process data, interface information, and documentation. Demonstrator built on component-based Java system but approach is language-agnostic.

Result: Developed an open-source web application demonstrator that provides natural-language explanations to guide developers through system behavior and potential errors.

Conclusion: The approach can be applied to any system at macro and micro levels to ease debugging, providing understanding even when developers lack full system familiarity.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays
remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is
especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems.
Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can
possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease
this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in
conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations.
These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface
information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to
understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes.
Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based
Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated
explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if
developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our
demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely
accessible to all users.

*Dennis Schiese,Aleksandr Perevalov,Andreas Both*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents an approach for explaining component-based Question Answering systems using LLMs to generate high-quality explanations from SPARQL queries and RDF triples data flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Software systems, particularly AI-driven QA components, have become so complex that their decisions are hard to explain even for experts. There's a need to make these systems more interpretable and understandable.

Method: The approach uses components' input (SPARQL queries) and output (RDF triples) data flows as source for explanations. Two methods are compared: template-based baseline and automatic generation using Large Language Models with different configurations.

Result: LLM-generated explanations achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches according to user ratings. The approach successfully explains QA component behavior and decisions using RDF and SPARQL as context.

Conclusion: Using LLMs with RDF and SPARQL context enables automatic generation of high-quality explanations for complex QA systems, making them more interpretable and understandable to humans.

Abstract: Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it
difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made
by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based
systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes
driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly
explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed
process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an
approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source
for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components,
enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the
data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF
triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on
verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach
generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or
via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations
(automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated
via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches
according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically
explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF
and SPARQL as a context for explanations.

### [238] [Assessing the Quality and Security of AI-Generated Code: A Quantitative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14727)
*Abbas Sabra,Olivier Schmitt,Joseph Tyler*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM-generated code contains significant bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells despite functional correctness, requiring static analysis verification before production use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantitatively evaluate code quality and security of prominent LLMs beyond just functional performance, identifying systemic weaknesses in current code generation methods.

Method: Tested 4,442 Java coding assignments from 5 LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, OpenCoder 8B) using SonarQube static analysis.

Result: All models introduced software defects including critical security vulnerabilities like hard-coded passwords and path traversal issues. No correlation found between functional performance (Pass@1 rate) and code quality/security.

Conclusion: LLM-generated code requires static analysis verification as functional benchmarks don't indicate code quality. Static analysis is essential for detecting latent defects in AI-assisted software development.

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and
security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior
research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this
research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through
comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that
although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of
software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared
weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code
generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded
passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple
models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in
order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation
between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit
tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by
the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the
functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is
not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this
study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models
appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the
view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent
defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software
development.

*Guangyi He,Tobias Sutter,Lukas Gonon*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: Deep hedging strategies are vulnerable to distributional shifts. The paper proposes adversarial training to make them robust to input perturbations using Wasserstein ball optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deep hedging models show significant performance degradation when faced with small distributional shifts, highlighting the need for more robust approaches.

Method: Proposes adversarial training framework that extends pointwise attacks to distributional setting, with computationally tractable reformulation over Wasserstein ball for efficient training.

Result: Adversarially trained deep hedging strategies outperform classical counterparts in out-of-sample performance and resilience to model misspecification.

Conclusion: Establishes a practical and effective framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties through adversarial training.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the robustness of classical deep hedging strategies
under distributional shifts by leveraging the concept of adversarial attacks.
We first demonstrate that standard deep hedging models are highly vulnerable to
small perturbations in the input distribution, resulting in significant
performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose an adversarial training
framework tailored to increase the robustness of deep hedging strategies. Our
approach extends pointwise adversarial attacks to the distributional setting
and introduces a computationally tractable reformulation of the adversarial
optimization problem over a Wasserstein ball. This enables the efficient
training of hedging strategies that are resilient to distributional
perturbations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that
adversarially trained deep hedging strategies consistently outperform their
classical counterparts in terms of out-of-sample performance and resilience to
model misspecification. Our findings establish a practical and effective
framework for robust deep hedging under realistic market uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable finite-trace LTLf/PPLTL techniques in infinite-trace settings while achieving full LTL expressiveness through the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy.

Method: Two solver approaches: 1) Symbolic solver based on Emerson-Lei games that reduces lower-class properties to higher ones, 2) Manna-Pnueli games that natively embed objectives and compose solutions from simpler Emerson-Lei games.

Result: Implementation shows Manna-Pnueli games often offer significant performance advantages over symbolic approach, though not universally across all formulas.

Conclusion: Combining both symbolic Emerson-Lei and native Manna-Pnueli game approaches could further enhance practical performance for reactive synthesis in these temporal logics.

Abstract: Recently, the Manna-Pnueli Hierarchy has been used to define the temporal
logics LTLfp and PPLTLp, which allow to use finite-trace LTLf/PPLTL techniques
in infinite-trace settings while achieving the expressiveness of full LTL. In
this paper, we present the first actual solvers for reactive synthesis in these
logics. These are based on games on graphs that leverage DFA-based techniques
from LTLf/PPLTL to construct the game arena. We start with a symbolic solver
based on Emerson-Lei games, which reduces lower-class properties (guarantee,
safety) to higher ones (recurrence, persistence) before solving the game. We
then introduce Manna-Pnueli games, which natively embed Manna-Pnueli objectives
into the arena. These games are solved by composing solutions to a DAG of
simpler Emerson-Lei games, resulting in a provably more efficient approach. We
implemented the solvers and practically evaluated their performance on a range
of representative formulas. The results show that Manna-Pnueli games often
offer significant advantages, though not universally, indicating that combining
both approaches could further enhance practical performance.

Motivation: To understand the geometric properties of the extended Gaussian family's parameter space, which forms a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, and explore its applications for handling extended Gaussian distributions.

Method: Analyze the Hilbert geometry of the open bounded convex symmetric positive-definite bicone, derive closed-form formulas for the Hilbert metric distance, and study its invariance properties.

Result: Reported closed-form formula for the Hilbert metric distance on this bicone structure and conducted exhaustive analysis of its invariance properties.

Conclusion: The Hilbert geometry provides a mathematical framework for the extended Gaussian family's parameter space, with potential applications for working with extended Gaussian distributions that include degenerate cases.

Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained
by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by
degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both
degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a
symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric
positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we
study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric
positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the
corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance
properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for
dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice biomarkers show promise for non-invasive disease detection but clinical adoption is limited by inconsistent quality and usability of publicly available datasets.

Method: Used FAIR Data Maturity Model and priority-weighted scoring to assess 27 datasets at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability.

Result: Mental health datasets showed greater FAIR score variability while neurodegenerative datasets were more consistent. Repository choice significantly influenced FAIRness scores. High Findability but substantial weaknesses in other FAIR principles.

Conclusion: Recommend adopting structured metadata standards, using FAIR-compliant repositories, and applying structured evaluation frameworks to improve dataset quality and accelerate clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing,
and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and
monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical
adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of
publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first
systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of
27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas.
Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring
method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels.
Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability
and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental
health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while
neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice
also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and
clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata
standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying
structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable
guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating
the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models often fail to capture intermittently occurring vocals in music source separation, requiring better long-range temporal dependency modeling.

Method: Combines Mamba2 state space model with band-splitting strategy and dual-path architecture to efficiently handle long input sequences and capture temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieves 11.03 dB cSDR (best reported to date) with substantial gains in uSDR, showing stable performance across varying input lengths and vocal patterns.

Conclusion: Mamba-based models are effective for high-resolution audio processing and open new directions for broader audio research applications.

Abstract: We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal
isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture
intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state
space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long
input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a
dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to
date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits
stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal
occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based

Motivation: Existing foundation models excel in vision and language but under-explore machine signal modeling. Current approaches have limitations with fixed input lengths and lack explicit frequency positional encoding.

Method: Integrates advanced band-split architecture with relative frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across arbitrary sampling configurations without padding or segmentation.

Result: Achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on SIREN benchmark (DCASE 2020-2025 challenges and industrial signal corpora) for anomaly detection and fault identification.

Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates effectiveness and strong generalization capability for machine signal encoding, with open-source implementation available.

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision
and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering
acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored.
Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive
results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit
frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation
model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative
frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across
arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary
length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that
retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN

for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE
task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in
anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and

Motivation: To develop an automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy from MRI to ease clinical workflow of preoperative planning for liver surgery.

Method: Used nnU-Net v1 trained on 72 patients' manual segmentations with focus on thin structures and topography preservation, evaluated on 18-patient test set using Dice similarity coefficient.

Result: Achieved high DSCs: 0.97 for parenchyma, 0.80 for hepatic vein, 0.79 for biliary tree, 0.77 for tumors, 0.74 for portal vein. Detected additional tumors missed by radiologists.

Conclusion: The nnU-Net-based method enables accurate automated delineation of hepatic anatomy, making 3D planning feasible as standard-of-care for liver surgery patients.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep
learning-based automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy (i.e.,
parenchyma, tumors, portal vein, hepatic vein and biliary tree) from the
hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This method should ease the
clinical workflow of preoperative planning.
  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans
from 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020
and October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72
patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.
Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and
manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following
clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated
using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required
adjustments using DSC.
  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma,
0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for
tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was
76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment
dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D
models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01)
and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater
variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model
detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.
  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate
and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be
applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver
surgery.

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of deep learning models with explainable AI for automated knee MRI ROI detection, showing ResNet50 outperforms transformers and U-Net variants in classification and ROI identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI interpretation is time-consuming and prone to variability, necessitating automated and interpretable AI solutions for knee injury diagnosis.

Method: Evaluated supervised and self-supervised approaches including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers, and U-Net variants with MLP classifiers, integrated with xAI methods (Grad-CAM, Saliency Maps).

Result: ResNet50 excelled in classification and ROI identification, outperforming transformer models. Hybrid U-Net+MLP showed potential for spatial features but lower classification performance. Grad-CAM provided most clinically meaningful explanations.

Conclusion: CNN-based transfer learning is most effective for this dataset, while larger-scale pretraining may better unlock transformer potential in future work.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool for
assessing knee injuries. However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains
time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a
systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with
explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI)
detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised
approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and
multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate
xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed
using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along
with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50
consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming
transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While
hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in
reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains
lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful
explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges
as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with
larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.

*Jason Granstedt,Prabhat Kc,Rucha Deshpande,Victor Garcia,Aldo Badano*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a practical definition for hallucinations in medical AI devices as plausible errors that can be either impactful or benign, aiming to standardize evaluation across different medical device areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning and data-based medical devices frequently produce errors that are often vaguely described as 'hallucinations', but there's a lack of standardized definition and evaluation framework for these errors across different medical device domains.

Method: The authors draw from theoretical developments and empirical studies across multiple medical device areas to introduce a universal definition of hallucinations as plausible errors that can be either impactful or benign to clinical tasks.

Result: The paper provides a practical definition that facilitates evaluation of medical devices suffering from hallucinations and explores how this definition relates to existing evaluation methodologies through examples from both imaging and non-imaging applications.

Conclusion: The proposed definition helps standardize the understanding and evaluation of hallucinations in medical AI devices, and the paper discusses existing approaches for minimizing the prevalence of such errors across various medical device applications.

Abstract: Computer methods in medical devices are frequently imperfect and are known to
produce errors in clinical or diagnostic tasks. However, when deep learning and
data-based approaches yield output that exhibit errors, the devices are
frequently said to hallucinate. Drawing from theoretical developments and
empirical studies in multiple medical device areas, we introduce a practical
and universal definition that denotes hallucinations as a type of error that is
plausible and can be either impactful or benign to the task at hand. The
definition aims at facilitating the evaluation of medical devices that suffer
from hallucinations across product areas. Using examples from imaging and
non-imaging applications, we explore how the proposed definition relates to
evaluation methodologies and discuss existing approaches for minimizing the
prevalence of hallucinations.

TL;DR: MeshLDM: A novel Latent Diffusion Model architecture for generating realistic 3D cardiac meshes from patients with acute myocardial infarction, achieving high fidelity with only 2.4% difference from gold standard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generate diverse realistic cardiac anatomies for applications like in silico trials, computer simulations, and data augmentation for machine learning models in cardiology, where diffusion models are still scarce.

Method: Proposed MeshLDM architecture - a Latent Diffusion Model specifically designed for 3D mesh generation of cardiac anatomies, applied on left ventricular meshes from myocardial infarction patients.

Result: Successfully captures cardiac shape characteristics at both end-diastolic and end-systolic phases, generating meshes with only 2.4% difference in population mean compared to gold standard.

Conclusion: MeshLDM demonstrates effective application of diffusion models in 3D medical imaging for cardiac anatomy generation, showing promise for clinical and research applications in cardiology.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative
capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized
data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still
scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac
anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials,
electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine
learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent
Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To
this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed
model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from
patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms
of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction
metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the
cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction)
cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean
compared to the gold standard.

TL;DR: New fine-grained image quality assessment dataset FGRestore and model FGResQ specifically designed for image restoration tasks, addressing limitations of existing IQA metrics in distinguishing fine-grained quality differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IQA metrics show inherent weaknesses for image restoration tasks, particularly in distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images, creating a need for more accurate assessment methods.

Method: Created FGRestore dataset with 18,408 restored images across six IR tasks and 30,886 pairwise preferences. Proposed FGResQ model with coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking capabilities.

Result: FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics in extensive experiments and comparisons, demonstrating better alignment with fine-grained restoration quality.

Conclusion: The proposed FGResQ model and FGRestore dataset provide effective solutions for accurate quality assessment in image restoration tasks, addressing the limitations of conventional IQA metrics.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image
restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality
assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and
algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit
inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained
quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we
contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset
for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images
across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores,
FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences.
Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA
metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA
evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these
findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for
image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and
fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate
that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and
model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of complex lesion structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion images for automated segmentation tasks.

Method: Integrates transformer module into encoder-decoder framework with convolutional branch, boundary-guided attention mechanism, and multi-scale upsampling path.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc metrics, with better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: Well-suited for automated skin lesion segmentation tasks due to strong lesion recognition accuracy and robustness, particularly in handling complex structures and boundaries.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method based on an
improved TransUNet architecture to address the challenges of complex lesion
structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion
images. The method integrates a transformer module into the traditional
encoder-decoder framework to model global semantic information, while retaining
a convolutional branch to preserve local texture and edge features. This
enhances the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structures. A
boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path are also
designed to improve lesion boundary localization and segmentation consistency.
To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a series of experiments were
conducted, including comparative studies, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis,
data augmentation effects, input resolution variation, and training data split
ratio tests. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms
existing representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating
stronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model
achieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex
scenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation
tasks in skin lesion analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of volumetric ultrasound adoption by removing dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition protocols.

Method: Adapts Gaussian Splatting to ultrasound with slice-aware differentiable rasterizer, models anatomy as anisotropic 3D Gaussians, uses sensorless probe motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors.

Result: Compact, flexible, memory-efficient volumetric representation with high spatial fidelity for anatomical detail.

Conclusion: Accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound can be achieved computationally, offering scalable alternative to conventional systems and enabling AI-assisted diagnosis.

Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic
accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains
limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition
protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for
reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal
ultrasound (TVS) sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose
estimators. Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the
domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer
tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model
anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their
parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe
motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a
compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures
anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that
accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through
purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D
systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Novel framework using latent diffusion models to generate multiplex biomarker images from H&E stains, enabling virtual multiplex staining of up to 18 different markers with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity and cost limitations of multiplex imaging while leveraging existing large repositories of H&E images that lack corresponding multiplex data, enabling multimodal analysis and retrospective studies.

Method: Utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models (LDMs) with conditional diffusion modeling, fine-tuned for single-step sampling to handle varying pixel distributions across markers. Employs marker-by-marker generation with shared architecture and pixel-level loss functions for improved color fidelity.

Result: Validated on two public datasets, the framework successfully generates up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, significantly exceeding previous approaches that only achieved 2-3 marker types.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, enabling virtual multiplex staining that can facilitate retrospective studies and large-scale analysis of existing H&E image repositories.

Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous
visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing
molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition
have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large
repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting
opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage
recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling
complex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a
target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual
multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate
multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our
approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion
model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers.
To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different
marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for
single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference
efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two
publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in
generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a
substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches.
This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual
multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and
multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale
analyses of existing H&E image repositories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digital twins require accurate individualized anatomical modeling for clinical decision support, but existing methods often lack precision and may involve radiation exposure from CT imaging.

Method: Adapted rule-based approach from CT-based methods, incorporating robust image alignment and vertebra-specific orientation estimation to extract subpixel-accurate key-points from MRI scans for anatomical landmark generation.

Result: Developed radiation-free method that produces anatomically meaningful landmarks serving as boundary conditions and force application points in biomechanical spinal models, enabling subject-specific simulation of spinal mechanics.

Conclusion: This approach bridges medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation, supports personalized healthcare modeling, and is particularly suitable for large-scale studies and underrepresented populations due to its radiation-free nature.

Abstract: Digital twins offer a powerful framework for subject-specific simulation and
clinical decision support, yet their development often hinges on accurate,
individualized anatomical modeling. In this work, we present a rule-based
approach for subpixel-accurate key-point extraction from MRI, adapted from
prior CT-based methods. Our approach incorporates robust image alignment and
vertebra-specific orientation estimation to generate anatomically meaningful
landmarks that serve as boundary conditions and force application points, like
muscle and ligament insertions in biomechanical models. These models enable the
simulation of spinal mechanics considering the subject's individual anatomy,
and thus support the development of tailored approaches in clinical diagnostics
and treatment planning. By leveraging MR imaging, our method is radiation-free
and well-suited for large-scale studies and use in underrepresented
populations. This work contributes to the digital twin ecosystem by bridging
the gap between precise medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation,
and aligns with key themes in personalized modeling for healthcare.

TL;DR: Comparison of feature selection methods GCM vs LOCO shows GCM generally outperforms LOCO in efficiency across linear, non-linear additive, and single index models, with theoretical and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature selection and importance estimation in model-agnostic settings remains challenging, with wrapper methods being computationally intensive despite their model-agnostic nature.

Method: Theoretical comparison under three model settings (linear models, non-linear additive models, single index models) plus extensive simulations and real data examples using neural networks and gradient boosting trees.

Result: GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable regularity conditions, with quantified asymptotic relative efficiency showing GCM's superiority.

Conclusion: GCM methods are more efficient than LOCO for feature selection across various model types, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence from simulations and real data.

Abstract: Feature selection and importance estimation in a model-agnostic setting is an
ongoing challenge of significant interest. Wrapper methods are commonly used
because they are typically model-agnostic, even though they are computationally
intensive. In this paper, we focus on feature selection methods related to the
Generalized Covariance Measure (GCM) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO)
estimation, and provide a comparison based on relative efficiency. In
particular, we present a theoretical comparison under three model settings:
linear models, non-linear additive models, and single index models that mimic a
single-layer neural network. We complement this with extensive simulations and
real data examples. Our theoretical results, along with empirical findings,
demonstrate that GCM-related methods generally outperform LOCO under suitable
regularity conditions. Furthermore, we quantify the asymptotic relative
efficiency of these approaches. Our simulations and real data analysis include
widely used machine learning methods such as neural networks and gradient
boosting trees.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper reveals significant inconsistencies in C-index implementations across R and Python software for survival analysis, creating a "multiverse" where identical implementations yield different results, undermining reproducibility and model comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardization and reproducibility issues in quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event outcomes using the concordance index (C-index) across different software implementations.

Method: The authors analyze various C-index estimators (Harrell's, Uno's, Antolini's) across R and Python software, identify key variation sources (tie handling, censoring adjustments, risk summarization methods), and demonstrate consequences using breast cancer data and semi-synthetic examples with various survival models.

Result: Demonstrates that seemingly equal C-index implementations produce different results due to implementation variations, affecting predictive performance quantification and complicating fair model comparisons across studies.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for better reporting standards, provides guidelines for analysts navigating C-index variations, and calls for improved transparency and reproducibility in survival analysis software implementations.

Abstract: Quantifying out-of-sample discrimination performance for time-to-event
outcomes is a fundamental step for model evaluation and selection in the
context of predictive modelling. The concordance index, or C-index, is a widely
used metric for this purpose, particularly with the growing development of
machine learning methods. Beyond differences between proposed C-index
estimators (e.g. Harrell's, Uno's and Antolini's), we demonstrate the existence
of a C-index multiverse among available R and python software, where seemingly
equal implementations can yield different results. This can undermine
reproducibility and complicate fair comparisons across models and studies. Key
variation sources include tie handling and adjustment to censoring.
Additionally, the absence of a standardised approach to summarise risk from
survival distributions, result in another source of variation dependent on
input types. We demonstrate the consequences of the C-index multiverse when
quantifying predictive performance for several survival models (from Cox
proportional hazards to recent deep learning approaches) on publicly available
breast cancer data, and semi-synthetic examples. Our work emphasises the need
for better reporting to improve transparency and reproducibility. This article
aims to be a useful guideline, helping analysts when navigating the multiverse,
providing unified documentation and highlighting potential pitfalls of existing
software. All code is publicly available at:

*Md Mainul Abrar,Xun Jia,Yujie Chi*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: This study analyzes how AI agents learn to tune treatment planning parameters for prostate cancer radiotherapy by examining their decision-making process through explainable AI methods, showing that high-performing agents learn to identify dose violations and make efficient adjustments similar to human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the opaque decision-making process of AI agents in automatic treatment planning and understand how they generate high-quality treatment plans, which could enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies.

Method: Examined ACER-based AI agents at different training stages using explainable AI methods to analyze attribution from dose-volume histogram inputs to parameter-tuning decisions, assessing planning efficacy, efficiency, policy spaces, and tuning strategies.

Result: High-performing agents learned to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and make appropriate adjustments, requiring fewer tuning steps (12-13 vs 22), showing more concentrated tuning spaces with lower entropy (0.3 vs 0.6), and converging on adjusting only a few key parameters with organ-wise attribution-violation similarities of 0.25-0.5.

Conclusion: Successful AI agents effectively identify dose violations and employ global tuning strategies similar to skilled human planners, with better interpretability potentially enhancing clinician trust and inspiring new automatic treatment planning approaches.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to uncover the opaque decision-making process of
an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for automatic treatment planning.
  Approach: We examined a previously developed AI agent based on the
Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER) network, which automatically tunes
treatment planning parameters (TPPs) for inverse planning in prostate cancer
intensity modulated radiotherapy. We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents
from different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method
to analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to
TPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and
efficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining
these analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated
high-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.
  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned
to identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate
TPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH
attributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across
tested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required
fewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning
space with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few
TPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning
steps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER
agents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a
global tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like
skilled human planners.
  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process
may enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment
planning.

Motivation: Address concerns about quantitative accuracy and artifacts in deep learning-based PET reconstruction methods, which have hindered clinical adoption due to limited model interpretability, data dependence, and overfitting risks.

Method: Proposes PET-DPC - a conditional diffusion model with posterior physical correction. Uses innovative normalization to generate Geometric TOF Probabilistic Image (GTP-image) input, and incorporates physical information during diffusion sampling to perform scatter, attenuation, and random corrections.

Result: PET-DPC produces reconstructions closely aligned with fully corrected OSEM images, outperforms end-to-end deep learning models in quantitative metrics, and sometimes surpasses traditional iterative methods. Reduces reconstruction time by 50% for brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Generalizes well to out-of-distribution data and preserves background uniformity and tumor-to-background ratios.

Conclusion: PET-DPC is a promising approach for rapid, quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction with strong potential to improve clinical imaging workflows, as demonstrated by its performance across brain, whole-body, phantom, and simulated datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning-based reconstruction of positron emission tomography(PET) data
has gained increasing attention in recent years. While these methods achieve
fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the
presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven
dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical
adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with
posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An
innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF
Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated
during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior
scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated
on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated
brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully
corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in
quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative
methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data.
Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for
brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the
critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation
corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical
phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background
uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios.
Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid,
quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve
clinical imaging workflows.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: MAHL is a hierarchical LLM framework for chiplet design that uses six collaborative agents to improve RTL generation accuracy from 0 to 0.72 Pass@5 and achieves comparable/superior PPA results compared to expert-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI workloads grow in complexity, traditional chip design faces challenges with high dimensionality. While LLMs show promise in HDL generation, they struggle with chiplet design due to flat design approaches, high validation costs, and imprecise parameter optimization.

Method: Proposes MAHL framework with six collaborative agents for hierarchical chiplet design generation, including hierarchical description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverse-flow validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration.

Result: MAHL improves RTL generation accuracy significantly and achieves 0.72 Pass@5 accuracy for real-world chiplet design (vs 0 for conventional LLMs). Achieves comparable or superior Power, Performance, Area (PPA) results compared to state-of-the-art expert-based CLARIE.

Conclusion: MAHL successfully addresses LLM limitations in chiplet design through hierarchical collaboration, demonstrating substantial improvements in generation accuracy and PPA optimization for 2.5D integration challenges.

Abstract: As program workloads (e.g., AI) increase in size and algorithmic complexity,
the primary challenge lies in their high dimensionality, encompassing computing
cores, array sizes, and memory hierarchies. To overcome these obstacles,
innovative approaches are required. Agile chip design has already benefited
from machine learning integration at various stages, including logic synthesis,
placement, and routing. With Large Language Models (LLMs) recently
demonstrating impressive proficiency in Hardware Description Language (HDL)
generation, it is promising to extend their abilities to 2.5D integration, an
advanced technique that saves area overhead and development costs. However,
LLM-driven chiplet design faces challenges such as flatten design, high
validation cost and imprecise parameter optimization, which limit its chiplet
design capability. To address this, we propose MAHL, a hierarchical LLM-based
chiplet design generation framework that features six agents which
collaboratively enable AI algorithm-hardware mapping, including hierarchical
description generation, retrieval-augmented code generation, diverseflow-based
validation, and multi-granularity design space exploration. These components
together enhance the efficient generation of chiplet design with optimized
Power, Performance and Area (PPA). Experiments show that MAHL not only
significantly improves the generation accuracy of simple RTL design, but also
increases the generation accuracy of real-world chiplet design, evaluated by
Pass@5, from 0 to 0.72 compared to conventional LLMs under the best-case
scenario. Compared to state-of-the-art CLARIE (expert-based), MAHL achieves
comparable or even superior PPA results under certain optimization objectives.

TL;DR: Cristal is a novel methodology for constructing high-quality Boolean choice networks that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ABC, achieving significant area/delay reductions and runtime improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous choice network construction methods neglect choice quality and may not effectively contribute to technology mapping, despite using lossless synthesis techniques.

Method: Cristal introduces a new flow including representative logic cone search, structural mutation via equality saturation for diverse choices, and priority-ranking choice selection with network construction and validation.

Result: Cristal achieves average reductions of 3.85%/8.35% (area/delay) in delay-oriented mode, 0.11%/2.74% in area-oriented mode, and 63.77% runtime reduction on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: Cristal constructs fewer but higher-quality choices, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art Boolean choice network construction methods.

Abstract: Choice network construction is a critical technique for alleviating
structural bias issues in Boolean optimization, equivalence checking, and
technology mapping. Previous works on lossless synthesis utilize independent
optimization to generate multiple snapshots, and use simulation and SAT solvers
to identify functionally equivalent nodes. These nodes are then merged into a
subject graph with choice nodes. However, such methods often neglect the
quality of these choices, raising the question of whether they truly contribute
to effective technology mapping.
  This paper introduces Cristal, a novel methodology and framework for
constructing Boolean choice networks. Specifically, Cristal introduces a new
flow of choice network-based synthesis and mapping, including representative
logic cone search, structural mutation for generating diverse choice structures
via equality saturation, and priority-ranking choice selection along with

TL;DR: AI training workloads cause large power swings that can damage power grid infrastructure, requiring multi-pronged solutions across software, hardware, and datacenter levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large AI training jobs spanning thousands of GPUs create significant power variability due to alternating compute-heavy and communication-heavy phases, with power swings that could physically damage power grid infrastructure if their frequencies align with critical utility frequencies.

Method: The paper explores innovative solutions across the entire stack: software modifications, GPU hardware improvements, and datacenter infrastructure changes. Solutions are tested using real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power simulator to evaluate efficacy under real-world conditions.

Result: The research provides critical insights into the effectiveness of various interventions, presenting the pros and cons of each approach and demonstrating that a multi-pronged strategy is necessary to stabilize power consumption in large AI training workloads.

Conclusion: A comprehensive, multi-level approach spanning software, hardware, and infrastructure is required to safely scale AI training workloads by stabilizing their power consumption and preventing potential damage to power grid infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Artificial Intelligence (AI) training workloads spanning several tens
of thousands of GPUs present unique power management challenges. These arise
due to the high variability in power consumption during the training. Given the
synchronous nature of these jobs, during every iteration there is a
computation-heavy phase, where each GPU works on the local data, and a
communication-heavy phase where all the GPUs synchronize on the data. Because
compute-heavy phases require much more power than communication phases, large
power swings occur. The amplitude of these power swings is ever increasing with
the increase in the size of training jobs. An even bigger challenge arises from
the frequency spectrum of these power swings which, if harmonized with critical
frequencies of utilities, can cause physical damage to the power grid
infrastructure. Therefore, to continue scaling AI training workloads safely, we
need to stabilize the power of such workloads. This paper introduces the
challenge with production data and explores innovative solutions across the
stack: software, GPU hardware, and datacenter infrastructure. We present the
pros and cons of each of these approaches and finally present a multi-pronged
approach to solving the challenge. The proposed solutions are rigorously tested
using a combination of real hardware and Microsoft's in-house cloud power
simulator, providing critical insights into the efficacy of these interventions
under real-world conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CIM architectures face challenges with depthwise convolution acceleration, particularly buffer traffic issues that impact latency and energy consumption in edge AI devices.

Method: Proposed a novel CIM dataflow that maximizes data reuse and improves memory utilization during depthwise convolution operations.

Result: 77.4-87.0% reduction in buffer traffic, 10.1-17.9% reduction in data traffic energy, and 15.6-27.8% reduction in latency compared to conventional weight-stationary dataflow.

Conclusion: The proposed dataflow effectively addresses buffer traffic challenges in CIM architectures for depthwise convolution, significantly improving energy efficiency and performance for edge AI applications.

Abstract: Computing-In-Memory (CIM) offers a potential solution to the memory wall
issue and can achieve high energy efficiency by minimizing data movement,
making it a promising architecture for edge AI devices. Lightweight models like
MobileNet and EfficientNet, which utilize depthwise convolution for feature
extraction, have been developed for these devices. However, CIM macros often
face challenges in accelerating depthwise convolution, including
underutilization of CIM memory and heavy buffer traffic. The latter, in
particular, has been overlooked despite its significant impact on latency and
energy consumption. To address this, we introduce a novel CIM dataflow that
significantly reduces buffer traffic by maximizing data reuse and improving
memory utilization during depthwise convolution. The proposed dataflow is
grounded in solid theoretical principles, fully demonstrated in this paper.
When applied to MobileNet and EfficientNet models, our dataflow reduces buffer
traffic by 77.4-87.0%, leading to a total reduction in data traffic energy and
latency by 10.1-17.9% and 15.6-27.8%, respectively, compared to the baseline
(conventional weight-stationary dataflow).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the cognitive and neural basis of prompt engineering expertise, which is critical for effective LLM interaction but remains unexplored neurobiologically.

Method: Cross-sectional pilot fMRI study comparing brain functional connectivity and network activity between expert and intermediate prompt engineers.

Result: Experts showed increased functional connectivity in left middle temporal gyrus and left frontal pole, plus altered power-frequency dynamics in cognitive networks.

Conclusion: The study provides initial neurobiological insights into prompt engineering proficiency, with implications for designing better human-AI interfaces and understanding cognitive adaptation to AI systems.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective
interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and
neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper
presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating
differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between
experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural
signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including
increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle
temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency
dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into
the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the
implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with
LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to
cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of
AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This
interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and
machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and
adapt to complex AI systems.

TL;DR: Proposes ACCS, a task-agnostic EEG channel selection method using Channel Activity Coefficient to identify optimal channels, achieving 34.97% accuracy improvement without task-specific re-optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-density EEG arrays improve spatial resolution but cause cross-channel interference and computational overhead. Existing channel selection methods are task-specific and require re-optimization for each application.

Method: Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS) uses a novel Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) metric to quantify channel utility based on activity levels, selecting top 16 channels ranked by CAC.

Result: ACCS achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of downstream tasks or models, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications without requiring re-optimization.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive,
low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher
spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the
development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of
channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and
computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often
employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically
task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work
proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based
Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity
Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By
selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%
improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional
approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent
of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse
EEG-based applications.

*Takeshi Kobayashi,Shogo Yonekura,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Spike-based control systems collapse when motor neurons or synaptic bundles exceed critical limits, with fewer neurons increasing failure risk but enabling faster learning when successful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why spike-based control systems fail in artificial sensor-motor systems and identify parameter ranges where learning can succeed to study spike functions.

Method: Developed a system with variable independent synaptic bundles in sensor-to-motor connections and analyzed learning collapse conditions through quantitative measurements of weight update directions.

Result: Found critical limits for motor neurons and synaptic bundles, showed fewer neurons increase failure probability but enable faster learning when successful, and identified opposite-direction weight updates as explanatory factor.

Conclusion: Identifying the parameter range for successful spike-based learning enables study of previously inaccessible spike functions in artificial sensor-motor systems.

Abstract: Neuronal spikes directly drive muscles and endow animals with agile
movements, but applying the spike-based control signals to actuators in
artificial sensor-motor systems inevitably causes a collapse of learning. We
developed a system that can vary \emph{the number of independent synaptic
bundles} in sensor-to-motor connections. This paper demonstrates the following
four findings: (i) Learning collapses once the number of motor neurons or the
number of independent synaptic bundles exceeds a critical limit. (ii) The
probability of learning failure is increased by a smaller number of motor
neurons, while (iii) if learning succeeds, a smaller number of motor neurons
leads to faster learning. (iv) The number of weight updates that move in the
opposite direction of the optimal weight can quantitatively explain these
results. The functions of spikes remain largely unknown. Identifying the
parameter range in which learning systems using spikes can be constructed will
make it possible to study the functions of spikes that were previously
inaccessible due to the difficulty of learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs pose security challenges, but existing detection methods focus mainly on English and lack attention to authorship attribution for forensic analysis.

Method: Multi-task learning framework that captures unique characteristics of both text detection and authorship attribution tasks while sharing insights between them.

Result: Strong performance across 9 datasets and 4 backbone models, with valuable insights into cross-modal and cross-lingual patterns and robustness against adversarial obfuscation.

Conclusion: DA-MTL effectively addresses both detection and attribution tasks, providing insights into LLM behavior and generalization capabilities for forensic applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated
remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose
security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on
distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most
solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining
which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little
attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we
present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses
both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine
datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across
multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique
characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in
both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and
cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against
adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into
LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship
attribution.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MultiFuzz is a multi-agent system that uses dense retrieval and RAG to improve protocol fuzzing by leveraging protocol documentation for better semantic understanding and state coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques lack semantic understanding of complex protocols, and recent LLM-based approaches like ChatAFL suffer from unreliable outputs, hallucinations, and knowledge assumptions about protocol specifications.

Method: Uses dense retrieval to build embeddings from protocol documentation (RFCs) in a vector database for RAG pipeline. Employs specialized agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on retrieved contextual knowledge.

Result: Experimental evaluations on RTSP show MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states/transitions compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers (NSFuzz, AFLNet, ChatAFL).

Conclusion: MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing by combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, providing a scalable foundation for intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based
systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of
complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works,
such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol
fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider
exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like
unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about
protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense
retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by
integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and
structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of
protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database
for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to
generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating
protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic
constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups
of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically
adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.
Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate
that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper
protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as
NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic
coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new
paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible
foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CCFC is a dual-track prompt-level defense framework that reduces jailbreak attack success rates by 50-75% against strong adversaries while maintaining response quality on benign queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jailbreak attacks pose serious threats to LLM safety deployment, requiring robust defenses against prompt injection and structure-aware attacks that current methods struggle to handle effectively.

Method: Uses dual-track approach: 1) core-only track to isolate semantic core and ignore adversarial distractions, 2) core-full-core track to disrupt structural patterns exploited by gradient/edit-based attacks, with final response selected via safety consistency check across both tracks.

Result: Reduces attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against strong adversaries like DeepInception and GCG, while maintaining fidelity on benign queries and consistently outperforming existing prompt-level defenses.

Conclusion: CCFC provides a practical and effective solution for safer LLM deployment by offering robust protection against jailbreak attacks without compromising response quality on legitimate queries.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core & Core-Full-Core), a
dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs'
vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks.
CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot
prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a
core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or
prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural
patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response
is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring
robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC
cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against
strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on
benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer
LLM deployment.

TL;DR: This paper investigates adversarial attacks on machine learning models for credit card fraud detection using tabular data, showing that gradient-based attacks can successfully compromise model robustness in both white-box and black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While adversarial attacks have been well-studied in computer vision, their impact on ML models for credit card fraud detection using tabular data remains unexplored, posing significant security threats to the financial industry.

Method: The authors developed a holistic framework incorporating gradient-based attack methods on tabular credit card transaction data, testing both white-box and black-box adversarial attack scenarios, and transferring adversarial samples between different model types.

Result: The study confirmed that tabular data is susceptible to subtle perturbations, with adversarial attacks remaining effective even when transferred from gradient-based to non-gradient-based models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the urgent need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners regarding ML model security and the necessity of developing robust defenses for credit card fraud detection algorithms.

Abstract: Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is a critical application of Machine
Learning (ML) in the financial sector, where accurately identifying fraudulent
transactions is essential for mitigating financial losses. ML models have
demonstrated their effectiveness in fraud detection task, in particular with
the tabular dataset. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in
computer vision and deep learning, their impacts on the ML models, particularly
those trained on CCFD tabular datasets, remains largely unexplored. These
latent vulnerabilities pose significant threats to the security and stability
of the financial industry, especially in high-value transactions where losses
could be substantial. To address this gap, in this paper, we present a holistic
framework that investigate the robustness of CCFD ML model against adversarial
perturbations under different circumstances. Specifically, the gradient-based
attack methods are incorporated into the tabular credit card transaction data
in both black- and white-box adversarial attacks settings. Our findings confirm
that tabular data is also susceptible to subtle perturbations, highlighting the
need for heightened awareness among financial technology practitioners
regarding ML model security and trustworthiness. Furthermore, the experiments
by transferring adversarial samples from gradient-based attack method to
non-gradient-based models also verify our findings. Our results demonstrate
that such attacks remain effective, emphasizing the necessity of developing
robust defenses for CCFD algorithms.

*Phurinut Srisawad,Juergen Branke,Long Tran-Thanh*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: The paper studies payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games where a leader strategically influences a follower's best response without knowing their utility function, proposing EU and longEU policies that balance preference elicitation with utility maximization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of manipulating a follower's behavior in repeated Stackelberg games when the follower's multi-objective utility function is unknown but linear, requiring the leader to simultaneously learn preferences and maximize utility.

Method: Proposed manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU) that guide action selection and incentive offers, trading off short-term gains with long-term impact through sequential decision-making.

Result: Proved that longEU converges to optimal manipulation under infinite repeated interactions. Empirical results show improved cumulative leader utility and mutually beneficial outcomes without explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of follower's utility.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively enables leaders to manipulate follower behavior in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games through strategic incentive offers while learning unknown utility functions, achieving both individual and mutual benefits.

Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games,
where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best
response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the
follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives,
is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through
interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the
leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility
maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based
on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide
the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off
short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated
interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results
across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative
leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without
requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility
function.

TL;DR: A CNN-based pipeline for segmenting unstained live cells in bright-field microscopy that achieves 93% accuracy and 89% F1-score on challenging low-contrast, noisy images, with strong generalization to phase-contrast data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation methods fail to address the specific challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging including temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from cellular movement in high-throughput settings.

Method: Developed a low-cost CNN pipeline using frozen encoders within a U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems, adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates, progressive mechanisms to prevent overfitting, and ensemble techniques.

Result: Achieved 93% test accuracy and average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast, noisy, and blurry images. The model generalized effectively to phase-contrast LIVECell dataset despite minimal training exposure (<10%), demonstrating modality robustness.

Conclusion: The pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision for bright-field microscopy segmentation, requires minimal compute power, is adaptable using basic deep learning setups, and shows strong potential for real-world laboratory deployment across diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Live cell culture is crucial in biomedical studies for analyzing cell
properties and dynamics in vitro. This study focuses on segmenting unstained
live cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation
approaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the
challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where
temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from
cellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based
pipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified
U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems,
adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates,
progressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The
model was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants,
showing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93%
test accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast,
noisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on
bright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%),
yet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset,
demonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its
potential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The
model requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning
setups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell
variants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision

TL;DR: Improved multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that identifies and rewards cooperative behavior, outperforming MADDPG in team and individual rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms have shortcomings in addressing cooperative behavior among agents, limiting their effectiveness in multi-agent environments.

Method: Based on MADDPG framework, introduced a new parameter to increase rewards when cooperative behavior is identified among agents in multi-agent environments.

Result: The improved algorithm achieved higher team rewards and individual rewards compared to MADDPG when tested in PettingZoo environments.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm successfully enhances cooperative behavior in multi-agent systems, leading to improved performance in both team and individual objectives.

Abstract: We propose an improved algorithm by identifying and encouraging cooperative
behavior in multi-agent environments. First, we analyze the shortcomings of
existing algorithms in addressing multi-agent reinforcement learning problems.
Then, based on the existing algorithm MADDPG, we introduce a new parameter to
increase the reward that an agent can obtain when cooperative behavior among
agents is identified. Finally, we compare our improved algorithm with MADDPG in
environments from PettingZoo. The results show that the new algorithm helps
agents achieve both higher team rewards and individual rewards.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the
optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to
sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$,
there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde
O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any
$A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability,
$(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all
$x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic
factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current
matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a
broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call
iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment
bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya
and van Handel, GAFA 2024].

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: NoteIt is a system that automatically converts instructional videos into interactive notes by extracting hierarchical structure and multimodal information, allowing users to customize content and presentation formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated note generation tools fail to comprehensively preserve video information and lack diverse presentation formats and interactive features that users expect from digital notes.

Method: A novel pipeline that faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from instructional videos, with an interface for users to customize content and presentation formats.

Result: Solid performance in objective metrics and positive user feedback from a comparison user study with 36 participants, demonstrating the effectiveness of the pipeline and overall usability.

Conclusion: NoteIt effectively addresses the limitations of existing tools by providing comprehensive video information extraction and customizable interactive note generation for instructional videos.

Abstract: Users often take notes for instructional videos to access key knowledge later
without revisiting long videos. Automated note generation tools enable users to
obtain informative notes efficiently. However, notes generated by existing
research or off-the-shelf tools fail to preserve the information conveyed in
the original videos comprehensively, nor can they satisfy users' expectations
for diverse presentation formats and interactive features when using notes
digitally. In this work, we present NoteIt, a system, which automatically
converts instructional videos to interactable notes using a novel pipeline that
faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from
videos. With NoteIt's interface, users can interact with the system to further
customize the content and presentation formats of the notes according to their
preferences. We conducted both a technical evaluation and a comparison user
study (N=36). The solid performance in objective metrics and the positive user
feedback demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline and the overall
usability of NoteIt. Project website: https://zhaorunning.github.io/NoteIt/

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Multimodal EEG + eye tracking study shows 4-22% accuracy improvement in detecting reading-induced confusion using N400 ERP and gaze data, achieving up to 89.6% classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how confusion arises during reading when new information conflicts with readers' comprehension or prior knowledge, and to develop methods for detecting this confusion in real-time.

Method: Collected EEG and eye tracking data from 11 participants reading diverse real-world paragraphs, isolated N400 ERP as neural marker of semantic incongruence, integrated behavioral gaze markers, and used machine learning for multimodal classification.

Result: Multimodal models improved classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal baselines, reaching average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and best accuracy of 89.6%. Temporal brain regions showed dominance in neural signatures of confusion.

Conclusion: Findings enable development of adaptive systems for real-time confusion detection, with applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and accessibility through low-electrode BCIs.

Abstract: Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text
media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with
chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or
exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for
learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of
reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and
gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from
diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential
(ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and
integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed
analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during
naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG +
eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal
baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a
best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's
temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues
for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time
monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems
that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential
applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and
accessibility.

*Lixiang Yan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Proposes APCP framework for AI's evolving role in education from tool to collaborative partner, with 4 levels of AI agency and discussion on AI's capacity for true collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of conceptual framework for understanding, designing, and evaluating agentic AI in education as it transitions from instructional tool to active learning participant.

Method: Develops a four-level model (APCP framework) of escalating AI agency: Adaptive Instrument, Proactive Assistant, Co-Learner, and Peer Collaborator, grounded in sociocultural learning theories and CSCL.

Result: Provides a structured vocabulary for analyzing human-AI roles and responsibilities, concluding that while AI lacks genuine consciousness, it can function as an effective collaborator.

Conclusion: Urges shift towards learning environments that leverage complementary human-AI strengths, with significant implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and future AI education research.

Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid
transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool
towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This
shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of
proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual
framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI
interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel
conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as
a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of
escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an
Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a
Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural
theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this
framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and
responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a
critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,
examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared
intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while
AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed
as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant
implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda
for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning
environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

### [284] [TIME$[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ via Tree Height Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14831)
*Logan Nye*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: Square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing machines: TIME[t] ⊆ SPACE[O(√t)] via Height Compression Theorem and balanced binary tree transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish improved space-time tradeoffs for deterministic computation, showing that time-bounded computations can be simulated with significantly less space than previously known.

Method: Uses Height Compression Theorem to reshape computation trees into balanced binary trees with O(log T) DFS depth, midpoint recursion, potential functions to bound active interfaces, and algebraic replay engine with constant-degree maps over constant-size field.

Result: Achieves O(√t) space simulation for time-t computations, with uniform construction that relativizes and works across standard models. Provides branching-program bounds 2^O(√s) for size-s circuits and improved lower bounds.

Conclusion: The paper establishes optimal square-root space simulation for deterministic Turing machines, with broad implications for complexity theory including improved hierarchy results and space-efficient certifiers.

Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing
machines, showing ${\rm TIME}[[t] \subseteq {\rm SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$. The key
step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes
the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run
into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log
T)$ for $T = \lceil t/b \rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ work at leaves, $O(1)$
at internal nodes, and edges that are logspace-checkable; semantic correctness
across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ window replay at the unique
interface. The proof uses midpoint (balanced) recursion, a per-path potential
that bounds simultaneously active interfaces by $O(\log T)$, and an
indegree-capping replacement of multiway merges by balanced binary combiners.
Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a
constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS and index-free streaming,
ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding
the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b + \log(t/b))$ for block sizes $b \ge b_0$ with
$b_0 = \Theta(\log t)$, which at the canonical choice $b = \Theta(\sqrt{t})$
gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space; the $b_0$ threshold rules out degenerate blocks
where addressing scratch would dominate the window footprint. The construction
is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences
include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$
bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for
SPACE$[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and
$O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality
assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models.

*Chanyeol Choi,Jihoon Kwon,Alejandro Lopez-Lira,Chaewoon Kim,Minjae Kim,Juneha Hwang,Jaeseon Ha,Hojun Choi,Suyeol Yun,Yongjin Kim,Yongjae Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinAgentBench is the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-step reasoning retrieval (agentic retrieval) in finance, featuring 3,429 expert-annotated examples from S&P-100 firms to assess LLM agents' ability to identify relevant document types and pinpoint key passages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IR methods often fail in financial document retrieval due to the need for both semantic understanding and fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain knowledge. There's no existing benchmark to evaluate LLM-based multi-step reasoning retrieval capabilities in finance.

Method: Created FinAgentBench with 3,429 expert-annotated examples from S&P-100 listed firms. The benchmark separates retrieval into two reasoning steps: document type identification and key passage pinpointing. Evaluated state-of-the-art models and demonstrated targeted fine-tuning approaches.

Result: The benchmark provides a quantitative framework for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. Evaluation shows that targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance in financial contexts.

Conclusion: FinAgentBench establishes a foundation for studying LLM retrieval behavior in complex financial tasks and will be publicly released, with plans to expand to full S&P 500 and beyond.

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DP2Rec is a dual-phase recommendation model that uses playtime data and multimodal information to jointly optimize accuracy and diversity in game recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The video game industry needs scalable recommendation systems that maintain user engagement. Existing models underutilize playtime data and overlook multimodal information for enhancing diversity.

Method: 1) Playtime-guided interest intensity exploration with dual-beta modeling to separate strong/weak preferences. 2) Playtime-guided multimodal random walks that use both playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity to simulate player exploration.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world game dataset show DP2Rec outperforms existing methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Conclusion: DP2Rec effectively leverages playtime data and multimodal information to achieve superior recommendation performance by balancing accuracy and diversity through its dual-phase approach.

Abstract: The explosive growth of the video game industry has created an urgent need
for recommendation systems that can scale with expanding catalogs and maintain
user engagement. While prior work has explored accuracy and diversity in
recommendations, existing models underutilize playtime, a rich behavioral
signal unique to gaming platforms, and overlook the potential of multimodal
information to enhance diversity. In this paper, we propose DP2Rec, a novel
Dual-Phase Playtime-guided Recommendation model designed to jointly optimize
accuracy and diversity. First, we introduce a playtime-guided interest
intensity exploration module that separates strong and weak preferences via
dual-beta modeling, enabling fine-grained user profiling and more accurate
recommendations. Second, we present a playtime-guided multimodal random walks
module that simulates player exploration using transitions guided by both
playtime-derived interest similarity and multimodal semantic similarity. This
mechanism preserves core preferences while promoting cross-category discovery
through latent semantic associations and adaptive category balancing. Extensive
experiments on a real-world game dataset show that DP2Rec outperforms existing
methods in both recommendation accuracy and diversity.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Multi-agent framework dramatically improves LLM performance on complex neurological reasoning tasks, outperforming base models and RAG approaches by decomposing reasoning into specialized cognitive functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show promise in medical domains but require systematic evaluation for specialized neurological reasoning capabilities, particularly handling complex clinical questions that demand deep knowledge integration and sophisticated reasoning.

Method: Developed a benchmark using 305 neurology board exam questions classified by complexity. Evaluated 10 LLMs using base models, RAG, and a novel multi-agent system that decomposes neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis, and validation.

Result: OpenAI-o1 achieved highest base performance (90.9% accuracy), while medical models performed poorly (Meditron-70B: 52.9%). RAG provided modest benefits. Multi-agent framework dramatically improved performance - LLaMA 3.3-70B-based system reached 89.2% accuracy vs 69.5% base, with substantial gains on complex questions. Validated on independent MedQA dataset of 155 cases.

Conclusion: Structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts by addressing neurological reasoning challenges that persist with conventional enhancement methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical domains, but their
ability to handle specialized neurological reasoning requires systematic
evaluation. We developed a comprehensive benchmark using 305 questions from
Israeli Board Certification Exams in Neurology, classified along three
complexity dimensions: factual knowledge depth, clinical concept integration,
and reasoning complexity. We evaluated ten LLMs using base models,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and a novel multi-agent system. Results
showed significant performance variation. OpenAI-o1 achieved the highest base
performance (90.9% accuracy), while specialized medical models performed poorly
(52.9% for Meditron-70B). RAG provided modest benefits but limited
effectiveness on complex reasoning questions. In contrast, our multi-agent
framework, decomposing neurological reasoning into specialized cognitive
functions including question analysis, knowledge retrieval, answer synthesis,
and validation, achieved dramatic improvements, especially for mid-range
models. The LLaMA 3.3-70B-based agentic system reached 89.2% accuracy versus
69.5% for its base model, with substantial gains on level 3 complexity
questions. The multi-agent approach transformed inconsistent subspecialty
performance into uniform excellence, addressing neurological reasoning
challenges that persisted with RAG enhancement. We validated our approach using
an independent dataset of 155 neurological cases from MedQA. Results confirm
that structured multi-agent approaches designed to emulate specialized
cognitive processes significantly enhance complex medical reasoning, offering
promising directions for AI assistance in challenging clinical contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the significant lack of research on practical RAG application in industrial contexts despite growing industry adoption.

Method: Conducted semistructured interviews with 13 industry practitioners to explore real-world RAG implementation.

Result: RAG applications mostly limited to domain-specific QA tasks (prototype stages), requirements focus on data protection/security/quality, data preprocessing is key challenge, evaluation primarily human-driven.

Conclusion: Current industrial RAG adoption is in early stages with focus on basic requirements, highlighting need for more automated evaluation methods and attention to ethics/bias/scalability issues.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a well-established and rapidly
evolving field within AI that enhances the outputs of large language models by
integrating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge sources.
While industry adoption of RAG is now beginning, there is a significant lack of
research on its practical application in industrial contexts. To address this
gap, we conducted a semistructured interview study with 13 industry
practitioners to explore the current state of RAG adoption in real-world
settings. Our study investigates how companies apply RAG in practice, providing
(1) an overview of industry use cases, (2) a consolidated list of system
requirements, (3) key challenges and lessons learned from practical
experiences, and (4) an analysis of current industry evaluation methods. Our
main findings show that current RAG applications are mostly limited to
domain-specific QA tasks, with systems still in prototype stages; industry
requirements focus primarily on data protection, security, and quality, while
issues such as ethics, bias, and scalability receive less attention; data
preprocessing remains a key challenge, and system evaluation is predominantly
conducted by humans rather than automated methods.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MISS: A novel retrieval method that combines multi-modal information and lifelong sequence modeling in tree-based retrieval systems to improve recommendation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods struggle with utilizing lifelong user behavior sequences and multi-modal information due to the large candidate corpus size and reliance on interaction data only.

Method: Proposes multi-modal index tree built with multi-modal embeddings for better item similarity representation, and Co-GSU/MM-GSU modules for multi-perspective interest searching in lifelong sequences.

Result: Enables precise representation of item similarity and captures diverse user interests from lifelong behavior sequences in large-scale recommendation systems.

Conclusion: MISS provides a pioneering solution for integrating multi-modal information and lifelong sequence modeling in retrieval systems, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale industrial recommendation systems typically employ a two-stage
paradigm of retrieval and ranking to handle huge amounts of information. Recent
research focuses on improving the performance of retrieval model. A promising
way is to introduce extensive information about users and items. On one hand,
lifelong sequential behavior is valuable. Existing lifelong behavior modeling
methods in ranking stage focus on the interaction of lifelong behavior and
candidate items from retrieval stage. In retrieval stage, it is difficult to
utilize lifelong behavior because of a large corpus of candidate items. On the
other hand, existing retrieval methods mostly relay on interaction information,
potentially disregarding valuable multi-modal information. To solve these
problems, we represent the pioneering exploration of leveraging multi-modal
information and lifelong sequence model within the advanced tree-based
retrieval model. We propose Multi-modal Indexing and Searching with lifelong
Sequence (MISS), which contains a multi-modal index tree and a multi-modal
lifelong sequence modeling module. Specifically, for better index structure, we
propose multi-modal index tree, which is built using the multi-modal embedding
to precisely represent item similarity. To precisely capture diverse user
interests in user lifelong sequence, we propose collaborative general search
unit (Co-GSU) and multi-modal general search unit (MM-GSU) for
multi-perspective interests searching.

TL;DR: A scalable contest recommendation system using Wide and Deep Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) for daily fantasy sports platforms, showing improved recall and business metrics in production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Daily fantasy sports platforms have diverse contests and heterogeneous player preferences, requiring effective contest personalization to match players with suitable contests.

Method: Developed a Wide and Deep Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) as the core of a scalable contest recommendation system, productionized on a large fantasy sports platform.

Result: Online experiments demonstrated marked improvement over other candidate models in terms of recall and critical business metrics.

Conclusion: The WiDIR-based recommendation system effectively addresses contest personalization needs in large-scale fantasy sports platforms with millions of daily contests and players.

Abstract: In daily fantasy sports, players enter into "contests" where they compete
against each other by building teams of athletes that score fantasy points
based on what actually occurs in a real-life sports match. For any given sports
match, there are a multitude of contests available to players, with substantial
variation across 3 main dimensions: entry fee, number of spots, and the prize
pool distribution. As player preferences are also quite heterogeneous, contest
personalization is an important tool to match players with contests. This paper
presents a scalable contest recommendation system, powered by a Wide and Deep
Interaction Ranker (WiDIR) at its core. We productionized this system at our

### [293] [RewardRank: Optimizing True Learning-to-Rank Utility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14180)
*Gaurav Bhatt,Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil,Tanmay Gangwani,Tesi Xiao,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RewardRank is a counterfactual reward learning framework that models complex user behavior biases to optimize ranking systems, outperforming traditional methods on large-scale benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ranking systems use simplistic proxy losses that fail to capture real-world user behavioral biases like position bias, brand affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, leading to misalignment with actual user utility.

Method: Trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item permutations using logged data, then optimizes a ranking policy via differentiable soft permutation operators for end-to-end training over factual and counterfactual rankings.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on large-scale benchmarks including Baidu-ULTR and Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in utility-optimized ranking.

Conclusion: Modeling user behavior dynamics through counterfactual reward learning is effective for creating utility-optimized ranking systems that better align with real user preferences and engagement patterns.

Abstract: Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume
simplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are
sorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are
influenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand
affinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail
to capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with
actual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across
the ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling
user behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,
first trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item
permutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize
predicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling
end-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To
address the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen
permutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\textit{KD-Eval}$,
using a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)
$\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language
models. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the
Amazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior
dynamics for utility-optimized ranking. Our code is available at:

### [294] [OneLoc: Geo-Aware Generative Recommender Systems for Local Life Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14646)
*Zhipeng Wei,Kuo Cai,Junda She,Jie Chen,Minghao Chen,Yang Zeng,Qiang Luo,Wencong Zeng,Ruiming Tang,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: OneLoc is an end-to-end generative recommendation model for local life services that integrates geographic information through geo-aware semantic IDs, self-attention, and neighbor-aware prompts, while using reinforcement learning to balance multiple objectives including user interests and business goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local life service recommendation in Kuaishou App requires simultaneous consideration of user interests and real-time location, presenting challenges in utilizing geographic information and balancing multiple objectives that existing generative recommendation models haven't addressed.

Method: Proposes OneLoc with three key components: (1) geo-aware semantic ID for tokenization combining video and geographic information, (2) geo-aware self-attention leveraging location similarity and user real-time location, and (3) neighbor-aware prompt for contextual generation. Uses reinforcement learning with geographic and GMV reward functions to balance objectives.

Result: Deployed in Kuaishou App serving 400 million daily active users, achieving 21.016% improvement in gross merchandise value (GMV) and 17.891% improvement in order numbers.

Conclusion: OneLoc successfully addresses the challenges of geographic information utilization and multi-objective balancing in local life service recommendation, demonstrating significant performance improvements and successful real-world deployment at scale.

Abstract: Local life service is a vital scenario in Kuaishou App, where video
recommendation is intrinsically linked with store's location information. Thus,
recommendation in our scenario is challenging because we should take into
account user's interest and real-time location at the same time. In the face of
such complex scenarios, end-to-end generative recommendation has emerged as a
new paradigm, such as OneRec in the short video scenario, OneSug in the search
scenario, and EGA in the advertising scenario. However, in local life service,
an end-to-end generative recommendation model has not yet been developed as
there are some key challenges to be solved. The first challenge is how to make
full use of geographic information. The second challenge is how to balance
multiple objectives, including user interests, the distance between user and
stores, and some other business objectives. To address the challenges, we
propose OneLoc. Specifically, we leverage geographic information from different
perspectives: (1) geo-aware semantic ID incorporates both video and geographic
information for tokenization, (2) geo-aware self-attention in the encoder
leverages both video location similarity and user's real-time location, and (3)
neighbor-aware prompt captures rich context information surrounding users for
generation. To balance multiple objectives, we use reinforcement learning and
propose two reward functions, i.e., geographic reward and GMV reward. With the
above design, OneLoc achieves outstanding offline and online performance. In
fact, OneLoc has been deployed in local life service of Kuaishou App. It serves
400 million active users daily, achieving 21.016% and 17.891% improvements in
terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) and orders numbers.

TL;DR: OmniSense is an edge-assisted framework for real-time 360° video analytics that achieves low latency and high accuracy through spherical region of interest prediction and adaptive model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of 360° videos and extended reality applications requires advanced video analytics to extract actionable insights without blind spots, but faces significant computation and network resource challenges.

Method: Uses lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI) prediction to prune redundant information, then smartly scales vision models based on video content and network dynamics for optimized resource utilization.

Result: Improves accuracy by 19.8%-114.6% with similar end-to-end latencies compared to baselines, and achieves 2.0×-2.4× speedups while maintaining highest accuracy levels.

Conclusion: OmniSense effectively addresses the computational and network challenges of 360° video analytics, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency for real-time immersive video analysis.

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the
proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more
$360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential,
advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and
situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we
present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video
analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the
significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing
$360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$
videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI)
prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames.
Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales
vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource
utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and
evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive
evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it
improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end
latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping
the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineering education lacks personalized learning innovations seen in other fields, with traditional evaluation methods failing to address individual student needs and diverse learning requirements.

Method: Developed PAPPL platform with core ITS components (expert, student, tutor modules) using GPT-4o LLM to deliver context-sensitive hints, track student attempts, detect misconceptions, and provide progressive feedback.

Result: Created a scalable, data-driven tutoring environment that dynamically adapts to individual learning profiles and provides instructors with detailed analytics for evidence-based teaching adjustments.

Conclusion: PAPPL provides a fundamental framework for Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, demonstrating the potential of Generative AI for personalized progressive learning in STEM education.

Abstract: Engineering education has historically been constrained by rigid,
standardized frameworks, often neglecting students' diverse learning needs and
interests. While significant advancements have been made in online and
personalized education within K-12 and foundational sciences, engineering
education at both undergraduate and graduate levels continues to lag in
adopting similar innovations. Traditional evaluation methods, such as exams and
homework assignments, frequently overlook individual student requirements,
impeding personalized educational experiences. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces the Personalized AI-Powered Progressive Learning (PAPPL)
platform, an advanced Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) designed specifically
for engineering education. It highlights the development of a scalable,
data-driven tutoring environment leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to
enhance personalized learning across diverse academic disciplines, particularly
in STEM fields. PAPPL integrates core ITS components including the expert
module, student module, tutor module, and user interface, and utilizes GPT-4o,
a sophisticated large language model (LLM), to deliver context-sensitive and
pedagogically sound hints based on students' interactions. The system uniquely
records student attempts, detects recurring misconceptions, and generates
progressively targeted feedback, providing personalized assistance that adapts
dynamically to each student's learning profile. Additionally, PAPPL offers
instructors detailed analytics, empowering evidence-based adjustments to
teaching strategies. This study provides a fundamental framework for the
progression of Generative ITSs scalable to all education levels, delivering
important perspectives on personalized progressive learning and the wider
possibilities of Generative AI in the field of education.

*Lameck Mbangula Amugongo,Nicola J Bidwell,Joseph Mwatukange*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: This study explores how African AI professionals conceptualize trust in AI, finding that cultural values, educational background, and community relations significantly influence trust perceptions differently from Western perspectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most trust in AI research focuses on WEIRD societies, lacking African perspectives. This study aims to understand how African AI professionals conceptualize trust, given their unique cultural and social contexts.

Method: Surveyed 157 people with professional/educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, many connected to AI workshops in Namibia and Ghana. Explored their conceptualizations of trust in AI systems.

Result: African professionals' trust perceptions are influenced by educational background, transnational mobility, and country of origin. They emphasize communal relations over individual freedoms and apply Afro-relationalism to international trust constructs like reliability.

Conclusion: The study reveals culturally distinct trust conceptualizations in African contexts, motivating more empirical research on how trust is practically enacted in African AI design, use, and governance realities.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of AI is considered essential to the adoption and
application of AI systems. However, the meaning of trust varies across
industry, research and policy spaces. Studies suggest that professionals who
develop and use AI regard an AI system as trustworthy based on their personal
experiences and social relations at work. Studies about trust in AI and the
constructs that aim to operationalise trust in AI (e.g., consistency,
reliability, explainability and accountability). However, the majority of
existing studies about trust in AI are situated in Western, Educated,
Industrialised, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. The few studies about
trust and AI in Africa do not include the views of people who develop, study or
use AI in their work. In this study, we surveyed 157 people with professional
and/or educational interests in AI from 25 African countries, to explore how
they conceptualised trust in AI. Most respondents had links with workshops
about trust and AI in Africa in Namibia and Ghana. Respondents' educational
background, transnational mobility, and country of origin influenced their
concerns about AI systems. These factors also affected their levels of distrust
in certain AI applications and their emphasis on specific principles designed
to foster trust. Respondents often expressed that their values are guided by
the communities in which they grew up and emphasised communal relations over
individual freedoms. They described trust in many ways, including applying
nuances of Afro-relationalism to constructs in international discourse, such as
reliability and reliance. Thus, our exploratory study motivates more empirical
research about the ways trust is practically enacted and experienced in African
social realities of AI design, use and governance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI literature focuses on risks and harms, but there's a need to understand actual governance mechanisms and oversight practices in deployed AI systems.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with practitioners to collect 20 AI use cases, co-designed workflow diagrams, and analyzed oversight mechanisms and guardrails.

Result: Created a publicly available repository with visual diagrams and system descriptions, identified governance gaps, and found common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems.

Conclusion: Fabric serves as an extendable tool for researchers to study AI governance effectiveness and provides insights into real-world oversight practices.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from
financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic
literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms
that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available
repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms.
Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial
set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow
with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used
in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams
of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository,
we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of
deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving
tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

### [300] [Incident Analysis for AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14231)
*Carson Ezell,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Alan Chan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Proposes an incident analysis framework for AI agents to better understand and prevent harmful incidents, categorizing causes into system-related, contextual, and cognitive factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing incident reporting processes are insufficient for understanding AI agent incidents as they exclude sensitive but useful information like chain of thought or browser history.

Method: Develops an incident analysis framework drawing on systems safety approaches, identifying three types of causal factors and specific information needed for investigation.

Result: Provides recommendations for what information incident reports should include and what data developers/deployers should retain for investigators.

Conclusion: Understanding agent incidents is crucial for managing risks as AI agents become more widely deployed, requiring improved reporting frameworks.

Abstract: As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing
number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly
cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private
information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such
incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent
future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not
sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are
largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but
potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or
browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting
processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on
systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that
can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual
(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user
request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which
factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation
and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide
recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)
what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to
incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more
agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for
managing risks.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: First real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering using LCD display and stereo polarization cameras, enabling evaluation of photometric stereo methods and providing a baseline that outperforms state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of public real-world datasets for display-camera imaging systems hinders development and evaluation of display-based inverse rendering methods, despite the unique advantages of using displays as programmable light sources.

Method: Constructed and calibrated an imaging system with LCD display and stereo polarization cameras, captured diverse objects under one-light-at-a-time patterns, and provided high-quality ground-truth geometry.

Result: Created a dataset that enables synthesis of images under arbitrary display patterns and noise levels, and developed a simple yet effective baseline method that outperforms state-of-the-art inverse rendering approaches.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset fills a critical gap in display-based inverse rendering research and provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating new methods in this domain.

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured
images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:
each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the
polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular
separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world
dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as
light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of
display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first
real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we
construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo
polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse
geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We
also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the
synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different
noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing
photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet
effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming
state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on limited domain-specific languages and small datasets, restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures in 3D object reconstruction.

Method: Develop comprehensive Blender Python APIs for complex geometries, create large-scale paired object-code dataset with semantic decomposition, train multimodal LLM to translate 3D point clouds into executable Blender scripts.

Result: Superior performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks, enables intuitive geometric and topological editing through code modifications, enhances LLM reasoning capabilities for 3D shape understanding.

Conclusion: MeshCoder establishes a powerful and flexible solution for programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

TL;DR: Fast 3D human reconstruction from just front/back view images using foundation models and point cloud enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 190ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower the barrier for users to create 3D digital humans by reducing the input requirement to only two images (front and back views) instead of multiple overlapping views.

Method: Redesigned geometry reconstruction model based on foundation models to predict consistent point clouds from sparse inputs. Applied enhancement algorithm to supplement missing color information, then transformed complete colored point clouds into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.

Result: Reconstructs entire human in 190ms on single NVIDIA RTX 4090 with 1024x1024 resolution images. Achieves state-of-the-art performance on THuman2.0 and cross-domain datasets. Works with low-cost mobile device images.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables high-quality 3D human reconstruction from minimal input (two views), significantly reducing data collection requirements while maintaining fast performance and state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic,
which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose
a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only
two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier
for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the
difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from
the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on
foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input
images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an
enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,
and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are
directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.
Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on
a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain
datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with
images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data
collection. Demos and code are available at

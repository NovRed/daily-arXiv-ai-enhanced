Existing methods often\nrely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face\nissues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of\nend-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced\nmulti-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment\nselection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning\npipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs\nreasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on\nthe evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current\nquestion. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually\naware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we\nintroduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level\nrewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing\nframe-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and\nquestion comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing\nend-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,\nand EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both\naccuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video\nunderstanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Video-MTR is a reinforced multi-turn reasoning framework that iteratively selects key video segments and comprehends questions through end-to-end training, outperforming existing methods on long-form video understanding benchmarks.", "motivation": "Long-form video understanding faces challenges with long-range temporal dependencies and multiple events.

In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel\nencoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense\nfeatures of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an\nencoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized\nadapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial\ndetails. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality\nreduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that\neffectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted\nextensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation\ndatasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging\nmodalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation\naccuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the\n7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the\nsuperior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model\nprovides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the\naccuracy of medical image segmentation.

Specifically, we\nleverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of\ncreating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,\nPrompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then\nleverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,\nbringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user\nstudy, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers\nthe barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from\nimaginative ideas.", "AI": {"tldr": "Automated pipeline that generates LEGO assembly products from natural language prompts, including design generation and robotic construction", "motivation": "Assembly product creation requires significant manual effort and expert knowledge in both design and construction phases", "method": "Leverages LEGO bricks as assembly platform, generates physically buildable designs from natural language prompts, and uses bimanual robotic system for automated construction", "result": "Comprehensive user study shows the system significantly lowers barriers and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from imaginative ideas", "conclusion": "Prompt-to-Product successfully automates the end-to-end process of bringing user imaginations into real-world assembly products"}}

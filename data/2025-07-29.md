### [1] [Tuning adaptive gamma correction (TAGC) for enhancing images in low ligh](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19574)
*Ghufran Abualhail Alhamzawi,Ali Saeed Alfoudi,Ali Hakem Alsaeedi,Suha Mohammed Hadi,Amjed Abbas Ahmed,Md. Riad Hassan,Nurhizam Safie Mohd Satar,Waeel Yahya Yasseen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAGC, a model for enhancing low-light images by adaptively calculating gamma correction based on color luminance, improving image quality without manual adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light conditions degrade image quality, causing issues like low contrast, noise, and blurred details, necessitating automated enhancement solutions.

Method: The TAGC model analyzes color luminance and calculates an adaptive gamma coefficient automatically for different illumination levels.

Result: TAGC effectively enhances low-light images, preserving details, contrast, and color distribution while providing natural visual quality.

Conclusion: TAGC is an efficient solution for low-light image enhancement in applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and photography.

Abstract: Enhancing images in low-light conditions is an important challenge in
computer vision. Insufficient illumination negatively affects the quality of
images, resulting in low contrast, intensive noise, and blurred details. This
paper presents a model for enhancing low-light images called tuning adaptive
gamma correction (TAGC). The model is based on analyzing the color luminance of
the low-light image and calculating the average color to determine the adaptive
gamma coefficient. The gamma value is calculated automatically and adaptively
at different illumination levels suitable for the image without human
intervention or manual adjustment. Based on qualitative and quantitative
evaluation, tuning adaptive gamma correction model has effectively improved
low-light images while maintaining details, natural contrast, and correct color
distribution. It also provides natural visual quality. It can be considered a
more efficient solution for processing low-light images in multiple
applications such as night surveillance, improving the quality of medical
images, and photography in low-light environments.

### [2] [Is Exchangeability better than I.I.D to handle Data Distribution Shifts while Pooling Data for Data-scarce Medical image segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19575)
*Ayush Roy,Samin Enam,Jun Xia,Vishnu Suresh Lokhande,Won Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the 'Data Addition Dilemma' in medical imaging by proposing a method to control feature discrepancies in deep networks, improving segmentation performance across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and distributional shifts in medical imaging datasets hinder deep learning model performance, necessitating a solution for effective data pooling and addition.

Method: The authors use causal frameworks to control foreground-background feature discrepancies across deep network layers, enhancing feature representations for segmentation.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation on histopathology and ultrasound images across five datasets, including a novel curated dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed approach outperforms baselines, providing refined segmentation maps and addressing challenges in multi-source medical imaging.

Abstract: Data scarcity is a major challenge in medical imaging, particularly for deep
learning models. While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)
and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to
enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,
increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can
induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model
performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the
traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming
exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data
pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these
conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for
controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of
deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are
crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five
datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and
contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate
segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model
architectures. The code will be available on Github.

### [3] [T-MPEDNet: Unveiling the Synergy of Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder Network with Feature Recalibration for Tumor and Liver Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19590)
*Chandravardhan Singh Raghaw,Jasmer Singh Sanjotra,Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Shubhi Bansal,Shahid Shafi Dar,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-MPEDNet, a Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder Network, improves automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans by addressing heterogeneity and visual diversity, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans is crucial for diagnosis and treatment but is challenged by tumor heterogeneity and varying liver appearances across patients.

Method: T-MPEDNet uses a progressive encoder-decoder structure with skip connections, a Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism, and multi-scale features for refined local details and long-range context. Morphological boundary refinement is applied for precise boundaries.

Result: T-MPEDNet outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods, achieving DSC scores of 97.6% (liver) and 89.1% (tumor) on LiTS, and 98.3% (liver) and 83.3% (tumor) on 3DIRCADb.

Conclusion: T-MPEDNet is an effective and reliable framework for automated liver and tumor segmentation in CT scans.

Abstract: Precise and automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor within CT scans
plays a pivotal role in swift diagnosis and the development of optimal
treatment plans for individuals with liver diseases and malignancies. However,
automated liver and tumor segmentation faces significant hurdles arising from
the inherent heterogeneity of tumors and the diverse visual characteristics of
livers across a broad spectrum of patients. Aiming to address these challenges,
we present a novel Transformer-aware Multiscale Progressive Encoder-Decoder
Network (T-MPEDNet) for automated segmentation of tumor and liver. T-MPEDNet
leverages a deep adaptive features backbone through a progressive
encoder-decoder structure, enhanced by skip connections for recalibrating
channel-wise features while preserving spatial integrity. A
Transformer-inspired dynamic attention mechanism captures long-range contextual
relationships within the spatial domain, further enhanced by multi-scale
feature utilization for refined local details, leading to accurate prediction.
Morphological boundary refinement is then employed to address indistinct
boundaries with neighboring organs, capturing finer details and yielding
precise boundary labels. The efficacy of T-MPEDNet is comprehensively assessed
on two widely utilized public benchmark datasets, LiTS and 3DIRCADb. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the superiority of T-MPEDNet
compared to twelve state-of-the-art methods. On LiTS, T-MPEDNet achieves
outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 97.6% and 89.1% for liver and
tumor segmentation, respectively. Similar performance is observed on 3DIRCADb,
with DSCs of 98.3% and 83.3% for liver and tumor segmentation, respectively.
Our findings prove that T-MPEDNet is an efficacious and reliable framework for
automated segmentation of the liver and its tumor in CT scans.

### [4] [SurgPIS: Surgical-instrument-level Instances and Part-level Semantics for Weakly-supervised Part-aware Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19592)
*Meng Wei,Charlie Budd,Oluwatosin Alabi,Miaojing Shi,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgPIS introduces a unified part-aware instance segmentation (PIS) model for surgical instruments, combining instrument-level and part-level segmentation tasks using a transformer-based approach and weakly-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat instrument-level instance segmentation (IIS) and part-level semantic segmentation (PSS) separately, lacking interaction between tasks. A unified approach is needed for better automation in robot-assisted surgery.

Method: SurgPIS uses a transformer-based mask classification approach with part-specific queries derived from instrument-level queries. It employs weakly-supervised learning to train on disjoint datasets (IIS or PSS labelled) and a student-teacher approach for consistency.

Result: SurgPIS achieves state-of-the-art performance in PIS, IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The unified PIS approach and weakly-supervised learning strategy effectively address the limitations of existing methods, improving segmentation accuracy for surgical instruments.

Abstract: Consistent surgical instrument segmentation is critical for automation in
robot-assisted surgery. Yet, existing methods only treat instrument-level
instance segmentation (IIS) or part-level semantic segmentation (PSS)
separately, without interaction between these tasks. In this work, we formulate
a surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation
(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical
instruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach
and introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object
queries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In
order to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and
part-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS
to learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes. During
training, we aggregate our PIS predictions into IIS or PSS masks, thereby
allowing us to compute a loss against partially labelled datasets. A
student-teacher approach is developed to maintain prediction consistency for
missing PIS information in the partially labelled data, e.g., parts of the IIS
labelled data. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the
effectiveness of SurgPIS, achieving state-of-the-art performance in PIS as well
as IIS, PSS, and instrument-level semantic segmentation.

### [5] [Object-centric Video Question Answering with Visual Grounding and Referring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19599)
*Haochen Wang,Qirui Chen,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Yao Hu,Weidi Xie,Stratis Gavves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a VideoLLM model with object referring and grounding capabilities, proposes the STOM module for visual prompt propagation, and presents the VideoInfer dataset. It outperforms baselines in video QA and segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VideoLLMs lack object-centric, multiround interactions and are limited to text-only responses. This work aims to enhance flexibility in video understanding.

Method: The authors introduce a VideoLLM model with object referring and grounding, propose the STOM module for visual prompt propagation, and curate the VideoInfer dataset for object-centric video reasoning.

Result: The model outperforms baselines on 12 benchmarks across 6 tasks, demonstrating robustness in multimodal, object-centric video understanding.

Conclusion: The proposed VideoLLM, STOM module, and VideoInfer dataset significantly advance object-centric video understanding and interaction.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress in general video understanding. However, existing models primarily
focus on high-level comprehension and are limited to text-only responses,
restricting the flexibility for object-centric, multiround interactions. In
this paper, we make three contributions: (i) we address these limitations by
introducing a VideoLLM model, capable of performing both object referring for
input and grounding for output in video reasoning tasks, i.e., allowing users
to interact with videos using both textual and visual prompts; (ii) we propose
STOM (Spatial-Temporal Overlay Module), a novel approach that propagates
arbitrary visual prompts input at any single timestamp to the remaining frames
within a video; (iii) we present VideoInfer, a manually curated object-centric
video instruction dataset featuring questionanswering pairs that require
reasoning. We conduct comprehensive experiments on VideoInfer and other
existing benchmarks across video question answering and referring object
segmentation. The results on 12 benchmarks of 6 tasks show that our proposed
model consistently outperforms baselines in both video question answering and
segmentation, underscoring its robustness in multimodal, object-centric video
and image understanding. Project page:

### [6] [Exemplar Med-DETR: Toward Generalized and Robust Lesion Detection in Mammogram Images and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19621)
*Sheethal Bhat,Bogdan Georgescu,Adarsh Bhandary Panambur,Mathias Zinnen,Tri-Thien Nguyen,Awais Mansoor,Karim Khalifa Elbarbary,Siming Bayer,Florin-Cristian Ghesu,Sasa Grbic,Andreas Maier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Exemplar Med-DETR, a multi-modal contrastive detector, improves abnormality detection in medical images by leveraging class-specific exemplar features and cross-attention, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with learning effective class-specific features in medical images, especially in dense tissues like mammograms, limiting their generalizability.

Method: Exemplar Med-DETR uses cross-attention with intuitive class-specific exemplar features and an iterative training strategy for multi-modal contrastive detection.

Result: Achieves mAP of 0.7 for mass and 0.55 for calcifications in mammograms, with 16% improvement. Also shows gains in chest X-rays and angiography (4-7% improvement).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robust and generalizable detection capabilities, advancing medical imaging systems.

Abstract: Detecting abnormalities in medical images poses unique challenges due to
differences in feature representations and the intricate relationship between
anatomical structures and abnormalities. This is especially evident in
mammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating
radiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic
context, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific
features, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging
modalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal
contrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs
cross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar
features and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.
On Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass
detection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16
percentage points. Additionally, a radiologist-supported evaluation of 100
mammograms from an out-of-distribution Chinese cohort demonstrates a twofold
gain in lesion detection performance. For chest X-rays and angiography, we
achieve an mAP of 0.25 for mass and 0.37 for stenosis detection, improving
results by 4 and 7 percentage points, respectively. These results highlight the
potential of our approach to advance robust and generalizable detection systems
for medical imaging.

*Adrian Celaya,Tucker Netherton,Dawid Schellingerhout,Caroline Chung,Beatrice Riviere,David Fuentes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIST introduces a flexible postprocessing framework for medical image segmentation, evaluated in the BraTS 2025 challenge, enabling customizable strategies and high-quality outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of standardized tooling for rigorous comparison in medical image segmentation.

Method: Extended MIST's postprocessing module with transforms like small-object removal, largest component extraction, and morphological operations, composable into user-defined strategies.

Result: Evaluated three strategies, showing MIST's capability for rapid experimentation and refinement, producing high-quality segmentations.

Conclusion: MIST supports reproducible and scalable research in medical image segmentation, remaining open source and extensible.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation continues to advance rapidly, yet rigorous
comparison between methods remains challenging due to a lack of standardized
and customizable tooling. In this work, we present the current state of the
Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its
flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre-
and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024
BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing
module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms,
including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest
connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and
closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies,
enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate
three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more
complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS
ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid
experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality
segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and
extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image
segmentation.

### [8] [SynPAIN: A Synthetic Dataset of Pain and Non-Pain Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19673)
*Babak Taati,Muhammad Muzammil,Yasamin Zarghami,Abhishek Moturu,Airhossein Kazerouni,Hailey Reimer,Alex Mihailidis,Thomas Hadjistavropoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynPAIN is a synthetic dataset for pain detection in older adults, addressing diversity and bias issues in existing datasets, and improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pain assessment in non-communicative patients like older adults with dementia is challenging. Existing datasets lack diversity and underrepresent the target population.

Method: Created SynPAIN using generative AI to produce balanced synthetic facial expressions across demographics, validated with clinical tools.

Result: Synthetic data showed expected pain patterns, revealed algorithmic biases, and improved pain detection performance by 7.0% on real data.

Conclusion: SynPAIN fills gaps in pain assessment research, offering a diverse dataset and a framework for bias mitigation.

Abstract: Accurate pain assessment in patients with limited ability to communicate,
such as older adults with dementia, represents a critical healthcare challenge.
Robust automated systems of pain detection may facilitate such assessments.
Existing pain detection datasets, however, suffer from limited ethnic/racial
diversity, privacy constraints, and underrepresentation of older adults who are
the primary target population for clinical deployment. We present SynPAIN, a
large-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355
neutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:
20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we
created demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically
meaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain
expressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than
neutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment
tools based on facial action unit analysis. We experimentally demonstrate
SynPAIN's utility in identifying algorithmic bias in existing pain detection
models. Through comprehensive bias evaluation, we reveal substantial
performance disparities across demographic characteristics. These performance
disparities were previously undetectable with smaller, less diverse datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that age-matched synthetic data augmentation
improves pain detection performance on real clinical data, achieving a 7.0%
improvement in average precision. SynPAIN addresses critical gaps in pain
assessment research by providing the first publicly available, demographically
diverse synthetic dataset specifically designed for older adult pain detection,
while establishing a framework for measuring and mitigating algorithmic bias.

### [9] [Efficient Learning for Product Attributes with Compact Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19679)
*Mandar Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a label-efficient semi-supervised fine-tuning method for compact VLMs using DPO, leveraging unlabeled data to improve performance with minimal compute overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scale challenges of supervised fine-tuning for VLMs in e-commerce due to costly annotations.

Method: Uses PEFT for low-rank adapter training, generates reasoning chains for unlabeled data, and applies DPO loss for iterative fine-tuning.

Result: DPO-based fine-tuning outperforms supervised models and improves with more unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Unlabeled data can be effectively leveraged to enhance VLM performance in product attribute prediction.

Abstract: Image-based product attribute prediction in e-commerce is a crucial task with
numerous applications. The supervised fine-tuning of Vision Language Models
(VLMs) faces significant scale challenges due to the cost of manual or API
based annotation. In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage
unlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
Beginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ
PEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with
unlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled
sample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on
self-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated
model for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method
achieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset
spanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes
only unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised
model. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that accuracy with DPO training
improves with more unlabeled data, indicating that a large pool of unlabeled
samples can be effectively leveraged to improve performance.

*Matthew Drexler,Benjamin Risk,James J Lah,Suprateek Kundu,Deqiang Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepJIVE is a deep-learning method for multimodal data analysis, overcoming limitations of conventional methods by handling high-dimensional data and identifying nonlinear structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods fail with high-dimensional data and nonlinear structures, prompting the need for a more robust approach like DeepJIVE.

Method: DeepJIVE uses deep learning to perform Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE), with mathematical derivations and experimental validations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: DeepJIVE successfully uncovers joint and individual variations in multimodal data, including biologically plausible patterns in ADNI datasets.

Conclusion: DeepJIVE is a valuable tool for multimodal data analysis, demonstrated by its effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Conventional multimodal data integration methods provide a comprehensive
assessment of the shared or unique structure within each individual data type
but suffer from several limitations such as the inability to handle
high-dimensional data and identify nonlinear structures. In this paper, we
introduce DeepJIVE, a deep-learning approach to performing Joint and Individual
Variance Explained (JIVE). We perform mathematical derivation and experimental
validations using both synthetic and real-world 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets.
Different strategies of achieving the identity and orthogonality constraints
for DeepJIVE were explored, resulting in three viable loss functions. We found
that DeepJIVE can successfully uncover joint and individual variations of
multimodal datasets. Our application of DeepJIVE to the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) also identified biologically plausible
covariation patterns between the amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and
magnetic resonance (MR) images. In conclusion, the proposed DeepJIVE can be a
useful tool for multimodal data analysis.

*Haichuan Li,Tomi Westerlund*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Win is a BEV perception framework for urban environments, combining point cloud encoding and window-based feature extraction for multi-modality understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate perception in complex urban settings is crucial for autonomous navigation, requiring methods that handle multi-modality and fine-grained scene decomposition.

Method: Hierarchical architecture with a specialized encoder, window-based backbone, and query-based decoder, using variational approaches and mask-based instance segmentation.

Result: Produces data-consistent, contextually relevant masks and interpretable instance predictions for autonomous driving.

Conclusion: Co-Win enhances scene understanding and decision-making in autonomous systems through its novel framework.

Abstract: Accurate perception and scene understanding in complex urban environments is
a critical challenge for ensuring safe and efficient autonomous navigation. In
this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception
framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel
window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in
environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture
comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based
decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object
relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple
regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with
mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and
understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through
progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both
data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream
decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.

### [12] [Bias Analysis for Synthetic Face Detection: A Case Study of the Impact of Facial Attribute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19705)
*Asmae Lamsaf,Lucia Cascone,Hugo Proença,João Neves*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in synthetic face detectors, proposing an evaluation framework to analyze bias across facial attributes and using synthetic data for balanced analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic face detection models and datasets may be biased, causing detection failures for certain demographic groups and raising ethical concerns.

Method: An evaluation framework using synthetic data with evenly distributed attributes is introduced to analyze bias in five state-of-the-art detectors across 25 facial attributes.

Result: Synthetic face detectors exhibit bias toward specific facial attributes, with insights into bias origins from training data imbalances and activation maps.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for bias-aware synthetic face detection and provides tools for bias analysis.

Abstract: Bias analysis for synthetic face detection is bound to become a critical
topic in the coming years. Although many detection models have been developed
and several datasets have been released to reliably identify synthetic content,
one crucial aspect has been largely overlooked: these models and training
datasets can be biased, leading to failures in detection for certain
demographic groups and raising significant social, legal, and ethical issues.
In this work, we introduce an evaluation framework to contribute to the
analysis of bias of synthetic face detectors with respect to several facial
attributes. This framework exploits synthetic data generation, with evenly
distributed attribute labels, for mitigating any skew in the data that could
otherwise influence the outcomes of bias analysis. We build on the proposed
framework to provide an extensive case study of the bias level of five
state-of-the-art detectors in synthetic datasets with 25 controlled facial
attributes. While the results confirm that, in general, synthetic face
detectors are biased towards the presence/absence of specific facial
attributes, our study also sheds light on the origins of the observed bias
through the analysis of the correlations with the balancing of facial
attributes in the training sets of the detectors, and the analysis of detectors
activation maps in image pairs with controlled attribute modifications.

### [13] [Quaternion-Based Robust PCA for Efficient Moving Target Detection and Background Recovery in Color Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19730)
*Liyang Wang,Shiqian Wu,Shun Fang,Qile Zhu,Jiaxin Wu,Sos Again*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces uQRPCA+, an improved unsupervised method for moving target detection and background recovery in color videos, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs and inefficiencies of existing quaternion-based methods for color video processing, while enriching datasets and enhancing model generalization.

Method: Proposes uQRPCA and uQRPCA+ frameworks, leveraging quaternion Riemannian manifolds and the CR1B method to reduce QSVD complexity and balance target segmentation with background recovery.

Result: uQRPCA+ outperforms existing methods in moving target detection and background recovery tasks.

Conclusion: The uQRPCA+ framework effectively addresses computational challenges and improves performance, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Moving target detection is a challenging computer vision task aimed at
generating accurate segmentation maps in diverse in-the-wild color videos
captured by static cameras. If backgrounds and targets can be simultaneously
extracted and recombined, such synthetic data can significantly enrich
annotated in-the-wild datasets and enhance the generalization ability of deep
models. Quaternion-based RPCA (QRPCA) is a promising unsupervised paradigm for
color image processing. However, in color video processing, Quaternion Singular
Value Decomposition (QSVD) incurs high computational costs, and rank-1
quaternion matrix fails to yield rank-1 color channels. In this paper, we
reduce the computational complexity of QSVD to o(1) by utilizing a quaternion
Riemannian manifold. Furthermor, we propose the universal QRPCA (uQRPCA)
framework, which achieves a balance in simultaneously segmenting targets and
recovering backgrounds from color videos. Moreover, we expand to uQRPCA+ by
introducing the Color Rank-1 Batch (CR1B) method to further process and obtain

### [14] [Leveraging Sparse LiDAR for RAFT-Stereo: A Depth Pre-Fill Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19738)
*Jinsu Yoo,Sooyoung Jeon,Zanming Huang,Tai-Yu Pan,Wei-Lun Chao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GRAFT-Stereo, a method to improve stereo matching accuracy by integrating sparse LiDAR data into the RAFT-Stereo framework using pre-filling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance stereo matching accuracy by leveraging LiDAR depth data, especially under sparse LiDAR conditions.

Method: Proposes pre-filling sparse LiDAR depth data via interpolation in the initial disparity map and early fusion with image features, leading to the GRAFT-Stereo framework.

Result: GRAFT-Stereo outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods in sparse LiDAR scenarios across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods and demonstrates the success of pre-filling techniques in sparse conditions.

Abstract: We investigate LiDAR guidance within the RAFT-Stereo framework, aiming to
improve stereo matching accuracy by injecting precise LiDAR depth into the
initial disparity map. We find that the effectiveness of LiDAR guidance
drastically degrades when the LiDAR points become sparse (e.g., a few hundred
points per frame), and we offer a novel explanation from a signal processing
perspective. This insight leads to a surprisingly simple solution that enables
LiDAR-guided RAFT-Stereo to thrive: pre-filling the sparse initial disparity
map with interpolation. Interestingly, we find that pre-filling is also
effective when injecting LiDAR depth into image features via early fusion, but
for a fundamentally different reason, necessitating a distinct pre-filling
approach. By combining both solutions, the proposed Guided RAFT-Stereo
(GRAFT-Stereo) significantly outperforms existing LiDAR-guided methods under
sparse LiDAR conditions across various datasets. We hope this study inspires
more effective LiDAR-guided stereo methods.

TL;DR: LOMM improves video instance segmentation with Latest Object Memory (LOM) and Decoupled Object Association (DOA), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing long-term instance tracking and identity management in dynamic scenes for temporally consistent video instance segmentation.

Method: Uses Latest Object Memory (LOM) to track and update object states, and Decoupled Object Association (DOA) to handle new and existing objects separately.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art AP score of 54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: LOMM sets a new benchmark in VIS by improving tracking accuracy and identity consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Latest Object Memory Management (LOMM) for
temporally consistent video instance segmentation that significantly improves
long-term instance tracking. At the core of our method is Latest Object Memory
(LOM), which robustly tracks and continuously updates the latest states of
objects by explicitly modeling their presence in each frame. This enables
consistent tracking and accurate identity management across frames, enhancing
both performance and reliability through the VIS process. Moreover, we
introduce Decoupled Object Association (DOA), a strategy that separately
handles newly appearing and already existing objects. By leveraging our memory
system, DOA accurately assigns object indices, improving matching accuracy and
ensuring stable identity consistency, even in dynamic scenes where objects
frequently appear and disappear. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional approaches, setting
a new benchmark in VIS. Notably, our LOMM achieves state-of-the-art AP score of
54.0 on YouTube-VIS 2022, a dataset known for its challenging long videos.

*Jiaxin Liu,Qichao Ying,Zhenxing Qian,Sheng Li,Runqi Zhang,Jian Liu,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Face Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel task to recover original faces from retouched images, proposing MoFRR, a mixture of diffusion models, to address diverse retouching types effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about the authenticity of face images due to widespread retouching on social media, with existing methods lacking accurate restoration solutions.

Method: Proposes MoFRR, using specialized and shared experts with dual-branch structures (DDIM-based low-frequency and Cross-Attention-based high-frequency) for restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments on RetouchingFFHQ++ dataset show MoFRR's effectiveness in restoring original faces.

Conclusion: MoFRR successfully addresses the FRR task, offering a robust solution for restoring authenticity in retouched face images.

Abstract: The widespread use of face retouching on social media platforms raises
concerns about the authenticity of face images. While existing methods focus on
detecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from
the retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face
Retouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring
original faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional
image restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with
various types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the
low-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose
MoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR. Inspired by DeepSeek's expert
isolation strategy, the MoFRR uses sparse activation of specialized experts
handling distinct retouching types and the engagement of a shared expert
dealing with universal retouching traces. Each specialized expert follows a
dual-branch structure with a DDIM-based low-frequency branch guided by an
Iterative Distortion Evaluation Module (IDEM) and a Cross-Attention-based
High-Frequency branch (HFCAM) for detail refinement. Extensive experiments on a
newly constructed face retouching dataset, RetouchingFFHQ++, demonstrate the
effectiveness of MoFRR for FRR.

*Jeongwoo Shin,Inseo Lee,Junho Lee,Joonseok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes MAE's learning process, revealing early patch-level clustering, and proposes a self-guided masking method to enhance learning without external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover what and how MAE learns, as its intrinsic mechanisms are not fully understood.

Method: Proposes a self-guided masked autoencoder that uses informed masking based on patch clustering progress, replacing random masking.

Result: The method significantly improves learning efficiency without external aids, validated by downstream task experiments.

Conclusion: The self-guided MAE enhances representation learning while preserving its self-supervised nature.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation
learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer
vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how
MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that
MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly
early stages of pretraining. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided
masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its
progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the
vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without
relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the
benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on
various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HydraMamba introduces a state space model-based network for point cloud learning, addressing challenges like imperfect serialization and lack of locality learning with innovations like shuffle serialization and ConvBiS6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of attention mechanisms in point cloud learning, such as quadratic complexity and weak long-range dependency modeling, by leveraging the selective state space model (S6).

Method: Proposes HydraMamba with shuffle serialization for better point cloud adaptation to S6, ConvBiS6 for local and global dependency capture, and MHS6 for enhanced modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on object-level and scene-level tasks.

Conclusion: HydraMamba effectively addresses key challenges in point cloud learning, offering superior performance and modeling capabilities.

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a dominant operator in point cloud
learning, but its quadratic complexity leads to limited inter-point
interactions, hindering long-range dependency modeling between objects. Due to
excellent long-range modeling capability with linear complexity, the selective
state space model (S6), as the core of Mamba, has been exploited in point cloud
learning for long-range dependency interactions over the entire point cloud.
Despite some significant progress, related works still suffer from imperfect
point cloud serialization and lack of locality learning. To this end, we
explore a state space model-based point cloud network termed HydraMamba to
address the above challenges. Specifically, we design a shuffle serialization
strategy, making unordered point sets better adapted to the causal nature of
S6. Meanwhile, to overcome the deficiency of existing techniques in locality
learning, we propose a ConvBiS6 layer, which is capable of capturing local
geometries and global context dependencies synergistically. Besides, we propose
MHS6 by extending the multi-head design to S6, further enhancing its modeling
capability. HydraMamba achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks at
both object-level and scene-level. The code is available at

*Zhiming Liu,Paul Hill,Nantheera Anantrasirichai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JDATT is a joint distillation framework for turbulence mitigation and target detection, combining feature-level and output-level distillation to reduce model complexity while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing inefficiencies and high computational costs in existing turbulence mitigation and detection methods, especially for real-time applications.

Method: Integrates AT mitigation and detection modules with a hybrid distillation strategy (CWD, MGD, and KL divergence).

Result: Achieves superior restoration and detection accuracy with reduced model size and inference time.

Conclusion: JDATT is efficient for real-time deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence (AT) introduces severe degradations, such as rippling,
blur, and intensity fluctuations, that hinder both image quality and downstream
vision tasks like target detection. While recent deep learning-based approaches
have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their
high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time
applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote
surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation
and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for
Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates
state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified
knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while
minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme:
feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked
Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence
datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and
detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time,
making it well-suited for real-time deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransFlow uses pre-trained video diffusion models to generate realistic motion data for video salient object detection (SOD), improving performance by leveraging semantic motion priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training video SOD models is limited by scarce video datasets, and existing methods using spatial transformations produce unrealistic optical flows lacking semantic motion understanding.

Method: TransFlow transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, ensuring natural motion patterns and coherence.

Result: The method achieves improved performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: TransFlow effectively addresses the scarcity of video datasets for SOD by generating realistic training data using pre-trained video diffusion models.

Abstract: Video salient object detection (SOD) relies on motion cues to distinguish
salient objects from backgrounds, but training such models is limited by scarce
video datasets compared to abundant image datasets. Existing approaches that
use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail
for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical
flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which
transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate
realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich
semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different
objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to
generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects
exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and
temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple
benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthFlow synthesizes optical flow from single images using depth maps to expand training data for unsupervised video object segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of training data for two-stream VOS approaches by leveraging structural information in flow maps, which correlates with depth.

Method: Estimates depth maps from source images, converts them into synthetic flow fields, and uses these to create training pairs for an encoder-decoder model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on all public VOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: DepthFlow provides a scalable solution to data scarcity, enhancing VOS model performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to detect the most
prominent object in a video. Recently, two-stream approaches that leverage both
RGB images and optical flow have gained significant attention, but their
performance is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of training data. To
address this, we propose DepthFlow, a novel data generation method that
synthesizes optical flow from single images. Our approach is driven by the key
insight that VOS models depend more on structural information embedded in flow
maps than on their geometric accuracy, and that this structure is highly
correlated with depth. We first estimate a depth map from a source image and
then convert it into a synthetic flow field that preserves essential structural
cues. This process enables the transformation of large-scale image-mask pairs
into image-flow-mask training pairs, dramatically expanding the data available
for network training. By training a simple encoder-decoder architecture with
our synthesized data, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on all public
VOS benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and effective solution to the data
scarcity problem.

*Steven Walton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes architectural principles to enhance computer vision models' performance while reducing computational demands, focusing on data handling, neural architecture modifications, and leveraging Normalizing Flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for high-performance models in resource-constrained environments by reducing computational demands.

Method: Three approaches: optimizing data ingress/egress, modifying neural architecture (e.g., restricted attention in vision transformers), and leveraging Normalizing Flows for knowledge distillation.

Result: Improved model efficiency, enabling smaller, faster, and cheaper machine learning algorithms.

Conclusion: Careful architectural design can significantly enhance model efficiency without compromising performance.

Abstract: Major advancements in the capabilities of computer vision models have been
primarily fueled by rapid expansion of datasets, model parameters, and
computational budgets, leading to ever-increasing demands on computational
infrastructure. However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse
and resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for
architectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer
computational resources.
  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models
can achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.
We discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus
on data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into
and retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our
models make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to
become more performant. Second, we investigate modifications to the core neural
architecture, applied to restricted attention in vision transformers. This
section explores how removing uniform context windows in restricted attention
increases the expressivity of the underlying neural architecture. Third, we
explore the natural structures of Normalizing Flows and how we can leverage
these properties to better distill model knowledge.
  These contributions demonstrate that careful design of neural architectures
can increase the efficiency of machine learning algorithms, allowing them to
become smaller, faster, and cheaper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForCenNet rectifies document images by focusing on foreground elements, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook foreground elements, which are crucial for geometric correction in document images.

Method: Proposes a foreground-centric label generation, mask mechanism, and curvature consistency loss to enhance distortion correction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, effectively correcting layout elements like text lines and borders.

Conclusion: ForCenNet demonstrates the importance of foreground elements in document image rectification, offering superior results.

Abstract: Document image rectification aims to eliminate geometric deformation in
photographed documents to facilitate text recognition. However, existing
methods often neglect the significance of foreground elements, which provide
essential geometric references and layout information for document image
correction. In this paper, we introduce Foreground-Centric Network (ForCenNet)
to eliminate geometric distortions in document images. Specifically, we
initially propose a foreground-centric label generation method, which extracts
detailed foreground elements from an undistorted image. Then we introduce a
foreground-centric mask mechanism to enhance the distinction between readable
and background regions. Furthermore, we design a curvature consistency loss to
leverage the detailed foreground labels to help the model understand the
distorted geometric distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ForCenNet achieves new state-of-the-art on four real-world benchmarks, such as
DocUNet, DIR300, WarpDoc, and DocReal. Quantitative analysis shows that the
proposed method effectively undistorts layout elements, such as text lines and
table borders. The resources for further comparison are provided at

*Guiping Cao,Xiangyuan Lan,Wenjian Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Dongmei Jiang,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS-Det introduces a flexible Single-Query paradigm to address inefficiencies in transformer detectors caused by fixed queries and Recurrent Opposing Interactions (ROT). It disentangles attention learning to improve decoder efficiency and resolves query ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer detectors use fixed queries, which suffer from inefficiencies due to ROT and query ambiguity, limiting flexibility and performance.

Method: Proposes DS-Det with a Single-Query paradigm, disentangling Cross-Attention (one-to-many) and Self-Attention (one-to-one) to address ROT and ambiguity. Introduces PoCoo loss for prioritizing hard samples.

Result: DS-Det outperforms on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets across five backbone models, demonstrating superior efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: DS-Det effectively resolves query-related inefficiencies and ambiguity, offering a more flexible and efficient transformer detector.

Abstract: Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through
query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing
decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still
underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number
(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of
these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between
two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention
(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query
ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both
one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's
one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,
a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in
images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query
paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible.
Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention
disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many
process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process),
addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder
efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size
priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects.
Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and
WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of
DS-Det. The source codes are available at

*Joon Hyun Park,Kumju Jo,Sungyong Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeDiff leverages Stable Diffusion's attention mechanisms to generate high-quality pixel-level annotation masks without additional training, prompt tuning, or pre-trained segmentation networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate pixel-level annotation mask generation without human effort by fully exploiting text-guided Diffusion models.

Method: Uses cross-attention for coarse object localization (seeds) and self-attention for iterative region expansion, refining masks with background information.

Result: Generates high-quality masks directly from Stable Diffusion, eliminating the need for extra steps like training or prompt tuning.

Conclusion: SeeDiff is an efficient, training-free solution for semantic segmentation mask generation.

Abstract: Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic
segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level
annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class
without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of
images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled
by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these
works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and
thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or
the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In
this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,
from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.
In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object
localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region
expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the
semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively
spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale
self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image
often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences,
compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a
more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates
high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional
training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.

*Xin Hong,Longchao Da,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-LC, a hierarchical framework for flood mapping in arid regions, improves accuracy by addressing spectral confusion and refining boundaries, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban flooding in arid regions is challenging due to limited spectral contrast and rapid dynamics, requiring accurate mapping for emergency response and resilience planning.

Method: FM-LC uses a three-stage process: multi-class U-Net segmentation, binary expert model for misclassified areas, and Bayesian smoothing for refinement.

Result: Validated on the Dubai storm event, FM-LC achieved up to 29% F1-score improvement and sharper flood delineations.

Conclusion: FM-LC significantly outperforms single-stage U-Net baselines, offering a robust solution for flood mapping in arid urban areas.

Abstract: Urban flooding in arid regions poses severe risks to infrastructure and
communities. Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery
trajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and
resilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral
contrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and
highly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional
flood-mapping approaches. High-resolution, daily PlanetScope imagery provides
the temporal and spatial detail needed. In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a
hierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this
challenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial
multi-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and
bare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between
spectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early
checking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a
lightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the
flagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines
boundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.
We validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and
post-rainfall PlanetScope composites. Experimental results demonstrate average
F1-score improvements of up to 29% across all land-cover classes and notably
sharper flood delineations, significantly outperforming conventional
single-stage U-Net baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lava, a language-driven video analytics system for flexible and efficient querying of large-scale video data using natural language, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SQL-based video analytics approaches are rigid and limit analytical flexibility, prompting the need for a more adaptable natural language-driven solution.

Method: Lava uses a multi-armed bandit sampling method, an open-world detection module, and a trajectory extraction scheme to process natural language queries and retrieve video data.

Result: Lava improves F1-scores by 14%, reduces MPAE by 0.39, achieves 86% top-k precision, and processes videos 9.6x faster than baselines.

Conclusion: Lava demonstrates the effectiveness of natural language-driven video analytics for scalable and flexible querying of large-scale video data.

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of
operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video
analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an
SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this
constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories,
significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a
language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and
efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language.
Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language
queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and
arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a
multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level
localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval;
and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object
association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support
comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing
diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained
annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that
\textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$,
reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$
precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $
faster than the most accurate baseline.

*Samuel Ebimobowei Johnny,Blessed Guda,Andrew Blayama Stephen,Assane Gueye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only transformer, bypasses traditional alignment methods in CSLR, improving accuracy by 6.1% WER on Isharah-1000.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge communication gaps between hearing and hearing-impaired communities by improving continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) accuracy and scalability.

Method: Proposes AutoSign, using a decoder-only transformer with a temporal compression module (1D CNNs) and AraGPT2 for direct pose-to-text translation.

Result: Achieves 6.1% improvement in WER on Isharah-1000, with hand and body gestures being most discriminative.

Conclusion: AutoSign eliminates multi-stage pipeline limitations, offering a scalable and accurate solution for CSLR.

Abstract: Continuously recognizing sign gestures and converting them to glosses plays a
key role in bridging the gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired
communities. This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and
body gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a
combination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)
methods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then
align variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based
approaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error
propagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary
scalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address
these limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only
transformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,
bypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this
decoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and
the glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the
textual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal
compression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,
followed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).
Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body
gestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.
By eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial
improvements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to
6.1\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.

TL;DR: Proposes Knowledge Regularized Negative Feature Tuning (KR-NFT) for improved OOD detection in vision-language models, enhancing generalization and reducing false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the reduced generalization performance of negative prompt-tuned models on unseen classes and styles in OOD detection.

Method: Introduces Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) for feature separation and a knowledge-regularization optimization strategy (KR) to enhance discrimination and retain pre-trained knowledge.

Result: Improves ID classification, OOD detection, and reduces FPR95 by 5.44% on unseen ID categories with few-shot training.

Conclusion: KR-NFT effectively balances OOD detection and generalization, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for building reliable machine
learning models. Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection
capabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from
reduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative
Feature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture
termed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding
knowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies
distribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively
separating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation
maximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.
Additionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a
lightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and
mitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional
negative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.
To optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is
designed to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating
pre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on
trained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID
datasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,
KR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also
significantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\% under an unexplored generalization
setting with unseen ID categories. Codes can be found at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FineMotion dataset to improve text-driven human motion generation by focusing on detailed body part movements and timing, achieving a +15.3% accuracy boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generating human motions from text often neglect specific body part movements and their timing.

Method: Proposes the FineMotion dataset with 442,000 motion snippets and 95k detailed descriptions of body part movements, enhancing textual inputs.

Result: Demonstrates a +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM model and supports zero-shot fine-grained motion editing.

Conclusion: The FineMotion dataset significantly advances fine-grained human motion generation and editing, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Generating realistic human motions from textual descriptions has undergone
significant advancements. However, existing methods often overlook specific
body part movements and their timing. In this paper, we address this issue by
enriching the textual description with more details. Specifically, we propose
the FineMotion dataset, which contains over 442,000 human motion snippets -
short segments of human motion sequences - and their corresponding detailed
descriptions of human body part movements. Additionally, the dataset includes
about 95k detailed paragraphs describing the movements of human body parts of
entire motion sequences. Experimental results demonstrate the significance of
our dataset on the text-driven finegrained human motion generation task,
especially with a remarkable +15.3% improvement in Top-3 accuracy for the MDM
model. Notably, we further support a zero-shot pipeline of fine-grained motion
editing, which focuses on detailed editing in both spatial and temporal
dimensions via text. Dataset and code available at: CVI-SZU/FineMotion

*Ye Lu,Jie Wang,Jianjun Gao,Rui Gong,Chen Cai,Kim-Hui Yap*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMA is a framework for pose-lifting that captures spatial joint topology and motion dynamics independently, improving joint dependency modeling and motion pattern adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Mamba-based methods struggle with intricate joint connections and uniform processing of motion trajectories, neglecting intrinsic motion differences.

Method: SAMA uses a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) for joint feature fusion and a Motion-adaptive State Modulator (MSM) for tailored motion adjustments.

Result: The framework achieves advanced results with fewer computational costs across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMA effectively addresses limitations in joint dependency modeling and motion adaptation, offering a more efficient and accurate solution for pose-lifting.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based methods for the pose-lifting task tend to model joint
dependencies by 2D-to-1D mapping with diverse scanning strategies. Though
effective, they struggle to model intricate joint connections and uniformly
process all joint motion trajectories while neglecting the intrinsic
differences across motion characteristics. In this work, we propose a
structure-aware and motion-adaptive framework to capture spatial joint topology
along with diverse motion dynamics independently, named as SAMA. Specifically,
SAMA consists of a Structure-aware State Integrator (SSI) and a Motion-adaptive
State Modulator (MSM). The Structure-aware State Integrator is tasked with
leveraging dynamic joint relationships to fuse information at both the joint
feature and state levels in the state space, based on pose topology rather than
sequential state transitions. The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is
responsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus
applying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different
joints. Through the above key modules, our algorithm enables structure-aware
and motion-adaptive pose lifting. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm achieves advanced results with fewer
computational costs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaGS is a novel framework using 3D Gaussian Splatting to fuse 4D radar and monocular images for 3D object detection, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods for 4D radar and monocular images lack holistic scene understanding or suffer from rigid grid limitations, necessitating a more flexible approach.

Method: RaGS employs a cascaded pipeline: Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI) for coarse Gaussian positions, Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) for refining Gaussians, and Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) for rendering BEV features.

Result: RaGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: RaGS provides a flexible, resource-efficient solution for 3D object detection by dynamically focusing on objects while maintaining scene perception.

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensor for autonomous
driving, but effective 3D object detection from both 4D radar and monocular
images remains a challenge. Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either
instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene
understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we
propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as
representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.
3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of
Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing
a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to
construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based
Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize
coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)
fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of
interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians
into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing
on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while
offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on
View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its
state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.

*Junwen Duan,Wei Xue,Ziyao Kang,Shixia Liu,Jiazhi Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OW-CLIP is a system for open-world object detection (OWOD) that addresses data-hungry training, partial feature overfitting, and inflexibility by using multimodal prompt tuning, Crop-Smoothing, and dual-modal data refinement. It achieves 89% of SOTA performance with minimal self-generated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OWOD methods are limited by high annotation needs, overfitting, and rigid architectures. OW-CLIP aims to improve efficiency and adaptability.

Method: OW-CLIP uses plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning, Crop-Smoothing, and dual-modal data refinement with LLMs and cross-modal similarity. It includes a visualization interface for annotation.

Result: OW-CLIP achieves 89% of SOTA performance with only 3.8% self-generated data and outperforms SOTA with equal data.

Conclusion: OW-CLIP offers a data-efficient, flexible solution for OWOD, with improved annotation quality and competitive performance.

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) extends traditional object detection to
identifying both known and unknown object, necessitating continuous model
adaptation as new annotations emerge. Current approaches face significant
limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of
crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting,"
and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To
tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that
provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental
training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored
for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate
partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training
methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large
language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering.
Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to
explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual
feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of
state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data,
while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A
case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved
annotation quality of our visualization system.

TL;DR: DiffCode is a novel framework for all-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) that uses a latent diffusion-enhanced vector-quantized codebook prior to handle diverse information losses across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The heterogeneity across MedIR tasks (e.g., MRI, CT, PET) with distinct degradations and information losses makes unified restoration challenging. Existing methods struggle with these diverse losses.

Method: DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank for task-specific HQ prior features and employs a latent diffusion strategy to refine feature distribution and enhance prior retrieval.

Result: DiffCode outperforms existing methods in quantitative metrics and visual quality for MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Conclusion: DiffCode effectively addresses the challenges of all-in-one MedIR by integrating task-specific priors and leveraging latent diffusion for superior restoration performance.

Abstract: All-in-one medical image restoration (MedIR) aims to address multiple MedIR
tasks using a unified model, concurrently recovering various high-quality (HQ)
medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, and PET) from low-quality (LQ) counterparts.
However, all-in-one MedIR presents significant challenges due to the
heterogeneity across different tasks. Each task involves distinct degradations,
leading to diverse information losses in LQ images. Existing methods struggle
to handle these diverse information losses associated with different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent diffusion-enhanced
vector-quantized codebook prior and develop \textbf{DiffCode}, a novel
framework leveraging this prior for all-in-one MedIR. Specifically, to
compensate for diverse information losses associated with different tasks,
DiffCode constructs a task-adaptive codebook bank to integrate task-specific HQ
prior features across tasks, capturing a comprehensive prior. Furthermore, to
enhance prior retrieval from the codebook bank, DiffCode introduces a latent
diffusion strategy that utilizes the diffusion model's powerful mapping
capabilities to iteratively refine the latent feature distribution, estimating
more accurate HQ prior features during restoration. With the help of the
task-adaptive codebook bank and latent diffusion strategy, DiffCode achieves
superior performance in both quantitative metrics and visual quality across
three MedIR tasks: MRI super-resolution, CT denoising, and PET synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATCTrack is a novel vision-language tracker that aligns multimodal cues with dynamic target states for robust tracking in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language trackers struggle with dynamic target states and diverse textual expressions, limiting their effectiveness in real-world conditions.

Method: ATCTrack introduces temporal visual target-context modeling and precise target word identification with adaptive context word calibration.

Result: ATCTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed tracker effectively addresses dynamic target-context alignment and textual cue utilization, enhancing tracking robustness.

Abstract: Vision-language tracking aims to locate the target object in the video
sequence using a template patch and a language description provided in the
initial frame. To achieve robust tracking, especially in complex long-term
scenarios that reflect real-world conditions as recently highlighted by MGIT,
it is essential not only to characterize the target features but also to
utilize the context features related to the target. However, the visual and
textual target-context cues derived from the initial prompts generally align
only with the initial target state. Due to their dynamic nature, target states
are constantly changing, particularly in complex long-term sequences. It is
intractable for these cues to continuously guide Vision-Language Trackers
(VLTs). Furthermore, for the text prompts with diverse expressions, our
experiments reveal that existing VLTs struggle to discern which words pertain
to the target or the context, complicating the utilization of textual cues. In
this work, we present a novel tracker named ATCTrack, which can obtain
multimodal cues Aligned with the dynamic target states through comprehensive
Target-Context feature modeling, thereby achieving robust tracking.
Specifically, (1) for the visual modality, we propose an effective temporal
visual target-context modeling approach that provides the tracker with timely
visual cues. (2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words
identification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative
context words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.
(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack
achieves a new SOTA performance. The code and models will be released at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, stable, and accurate visual-based quadrotor control without relying on explicit geometric models or fiducial markers.

Method: Combines an improved IBVS teacher for stable feature detection with a student model trained via knowledge distillation, leveraging simulation-to-reality transfer learning.

Result: The student model achieves 11x faster inference than the teacher, with similar accuracy, and operates effectively in GPS-denied indoor environments.

Conclusion: The neuro-analytic control system offers a practical, efficient solution for real-time quadrotor navigation without traditional markers or models.

Abstract: This work introduces a self-supervised neuro-analytical, cost efficient,
model for visual-based quadrotor control in which a small 1.7M parameters
student ConvNet learns automatically from an analytical teacher, an improved
image-based visual servoing (IBVS) controller. Our IBVS system solves numerical
instabilities by reducing the classical visual servoing equations and enabling
efficient stable image feature detection. Through knowledge distillation, the
student model achieves 11x faster inference compared to the teacher IBVS
pipeline, while demonstrating similar control accuracy at a significantly lower
computational and memory cost. Our vision-only self-supervised neuro-analytic
control, enables quadrotor orientation and movement without requiring explicit
geometric models or fiducial markers. The proposed methodology leverages
simulation-to-reality transfer learning and is validated on a small drone
platform in GPS-denied indoor environments. Our key contributions include: (1)
an analytical IBVS teacher that solves numerical instabilities inherent in
classical approaches, (2) a two-stage segmentation pipeline combining YOLOv11
with a U-Net-based mask splitter for robust anterior-posterior vehicle
segmentation to correctly estimate the orientation of the target, and (3) an
efficient knowledge distillation dual-path system, which transfers geometric
visual servoing capabilities from the analytical IBVS teacher to a compact and
small student neural network that outperforms the teacher, while being suitable
for real-time onboard deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore federated domain generalization in semantic segmentation for autonomous driving, addressing the gap in synthetic-to-real adaptation.

Method: Uses inconsistency-driven data augmentation and multi-client knowledge distillation with feature fusion to train a global model.

Result: The global model outperforms individual client models and is close to the performance of a model trained with all client data.

Conclusion: FedS2R effectively addresses synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in federated learning for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Federated domain generalization has shown promising progress in image
classification by enabling collaborative training across multiple clients
without sharing raw data. However, its potential in the semantic segmentation
of autonomous driving remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose FedS2R,
the first one-shot federated domain generalization framework for
synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation in autonomous driving. FedS2R comprises
two components: an inconsistency-driven data augmentation strategy that
generates images for unstable classes, and a multi-client knowledge
distillation scheme with feature fusion that distills a global model from
multiple client models. Experiments on five real-world datasets, Cityscapes,
BDD100K, Mapillary, IDD, and ACDC, show that the global model significantly
outperforms individual client models and is only 2 mIoU points behind the model
trained with simultaneous access to all client data. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of FedS2R in synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation for
autonomous driving under federated learning

Motivation: To improve object localization in vision-language transformers by addressing extreme attention values and amplifying mid-level activations.

Method: RCA reweights final-layer attention, suppressing extremes and boosting mid-level activations to highlight semantically relevant tokens.

Result: RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 VLMs, with gains up to +26.6%, particularly benefiting late-fusion models.

Conclusion: RCA provides interpretability and performance gains, highlighting capacity and disentanglement as key factors.

Abstract: We propose Reverse Contrast Attention (RCA), a plug-in method that enhances
object localization in vision-language transformers without retraining. RCA
reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying
mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide
predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection
(OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based
on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with
gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion
timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like
$\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement
as key factors. RCA offers both interpretability and performance gains for
multimodal transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current category-specific 3D SOT methods are impractical due to their lack of generalization and the need for separate models per category. TrackAny3D aims to address these limitations.

Method: The framework uses parameter-efficient adapters, a MoGE architecture for adaptive subnetwork activation, and a temporal context optimization strategy with learnable tokens and dynamic mask weighting.

Result: TrackAny3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and competitiveness.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of unified models and large-scale pretrained models in 3D SOT, encouraging further research in this direction.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR-based single object tracking (SOT) relies on sparse and irregular
point clouds, posing challenges from geometric variations in scale, motion
patterns, and structural complexity across object categories. Current
category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for
real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited
generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first
framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D
SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between
pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we
introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively
activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics.
Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that
incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to
propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on
three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new
state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong
generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the
community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of
large-scale pretrained models in this field.

TL;DR: A mini-batch training strategy for deep subspace clustering (DSC) is introduced, using a memory bank for global features and a decoder-free framework with contrastive learning, achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DSC methods rely on full-batch processing, limiting scalability for high-resolution images.

Method: Proposes a mini-batch training strategy with a memory bank and a decoder-free framework using contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to full-batch methods and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COIL100 and ORL datasets.

Conclusion: The approach enables scalable DSC training and efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders.

Abstract: Mini-batch training is a cornerstone of modern deep learning, offering
computational efficiency and scalability for training complex architectures.
However, existing deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods, which typically
combine an autoencoder with a self-expressive layer, rely on full-batch
processing. The bottleneck arises from the self-expressive module, which
requires representations of the entire dataset to construct a
self-representation coefficient matrix. In this work, we introduce a mini-batch
training strategy for DSC by integrating a memory bank that preserves global
feature representations. Our approach enables scalable training of deep
architectures for subspace clustering with high-resolution images, overcoming
previous limitations. Additionally, to efficiently fine-tune large-scale
pre-trained encoders for subspace clustering, we propose a decoder-free
framework that leverages contrastive learning instead of autoencoding for
representation learning. This design not only eliminates the computational
overhead of decoder training but also provides competitive performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only achieves
performance comparable to full-batch methods, but outperforms other
state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods on the COIL100 and ORL datasets by
fine-tuning deep networks.

TL;DR: HumanSAM is a framework for fine-grained classification of human-centric video forgeries into spatial, appearance, and motion anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of synthetic human-centric videos threatens information security, but existing binary forgery detection lacks reliability and interpretability.

Method: HumanSAM fuses video understanding and spatial depth to capture geometry, semantics, and spatiotemporal consistency, using a rank-based confidence enhancement strategy.

Result: HumanSAM achieves promising results in binary and multi-class forgery classification on the new HFV dataset.

Conclusion: HumanSAM addresses the need for reliable and interpretable forgery detection, setting a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Numerous synthesized videos from generative models, especially human-centric
ones that simulate realistic human actions, pose significant threats to human
information security and authenticity. While progress has been made in binary
forgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery
types raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which
are critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we
propose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges
of video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify
human-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly
observed in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To
better capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal
consistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing
two branches of video understanding and spatial depth. We also adopt a
rank-based confidence enhancement strategy during the training process to learn
more robust representation by introducing three prior scores. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, the Human-centric Forgery
Video (HFV) dataset, with all types of forgeries carefully annotated
semi-automatically. In our experiments, HumanSAM yields promising results in
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both in binary and multi-class
forgery classification.

TL;DR: MambaVesselNet++ is a hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation, combining local feature extraction with efficient long-range dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional convolution-based methods lack global context, while vision transformers are computationally expensive. MambaVesselNet++ aims to balance efficiency and performance.

Method: Uses a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) with texture-aware layers and Mamba for long-range dependencies, and a bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder) for mask generation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MambaVesselNet++ offers an efficient and effective solution for medical image segmentation by combining CNN and Mamba strengths.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided
diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are
usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have
been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their
superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the
real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear
self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this
issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for
its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,
particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose
MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.
Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a
bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the
texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging
convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range
dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to
combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate
generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and
Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance
segmentation tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: LLM_Control is a framework using multimodal LLMs to enhance spatial control in text-to-image diffusion models, improving accuracy for complex prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spatial control methods for T2I diffusion models struggle with complex prompts and precise condition adherence.

Method: LLM_Control employs a multimodal LLM to guide spatial layouts, augment semantics, and bind attributes, injecting control signals into the denoising network.

Result: LLM_Control achieves competitive synthesis quality across various T2I models, outperforming existing methods on challenging inputs.

Conclusion: LLM_Control effectively addresses the limitations of current spatial control methods, enabling precise and high-quality T2I generation for complex prompts.

Abstract: Recent spatial control methods for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
shown compelling results. However, these methods still fail to precisely follow
the control conditions and generate the corresponding images, especially when
encountering the textual prompts that contain multiple objects or have complex
spatial compositions. In this work, we present a LLM-guided framework called
LLM\_Control to address the challenges of the controllable T2I generation task.
By improving grounding capabilities, LLM\_Control is introduced to accurately
modulate the pre-trained diffusion models, where visual conditions and textual
prompts influence the structures and appearance generation in a complementary
way. We utilize the multimodal LLM as a global controller to arrange spatial
layouts, augment semantic descriptions and bind object attributes. The obtained
control signals are injected into the denoising network to refocus and enhance
attention maps according to novel sampling constraints. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments have demonstrated that LLM\_Control achieves
competitive synthesis quality compared to other state-of-the-art methods across
various pre-trained T2I models. It is noteworthy that LLM\_Control allows the
challenging input conditions on which most of the existing methods

*Luoxi Jing,Dianxi Shi,Zhe Liu,Songchang Jin,Chunping Qiu,Ziteng Qiao,Yuxian Li,Jianqiang Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniCT Depth combines CNNs and Transformers for event-image fusion, improving depth estimation by addressing occlusion and depth disparity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-based methods struggle in challenging scenarios, and event cameras face sparse data issues. Combining both modalities is beneficial but integration remains difficult.

Method: Proposes UniCT Depth with CcViT-DA Block (CMSA and MFSA) for spatial and cross-modal fusion, and DCC Block for detail enhancement.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in monocular depth estimation across key metrics.

Conclusion: UniCT Depth effectively integrates event and image data, improving depth estimation performance.

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a crucial role in 3D scene understanding and is
extensively used in a wide range of vision tasks. Image-based methods struggle
in challenging scenarios, while event cameras offer high dynamic range and
temporal resolution but face difficulties with sparse data. Combining event and
image data provides significant advantages, yet effective integration remains
challenging. Existing CNN-based fusion methods struggle with occlusions and
depth disparities due to limited receptive fields, while Transformer-based
fusion methods often lack deep modality interaction. To address these issues,
we propose UniCT Depth, an event-image fusion method that unifies CNNs and
Transformers to model local and global features. We propose the
Convolution-compensated ViT Dual SA (CcViT-DA) Block, designed for the encoder,
which integrates Context Modeling Self-Attention (CMSA) to capture spatial
dependencies and Modal Fusion Self-Attention (MFSA) for effective cross-modal
fusion. Furthermore, we design the tailored Detail Compensation Convolution
(DCC) Block to improve texture details and enhances edge representations.
Experiments show that UniCT Depth outperforms existing image, event, and
fusion-based monocular depth estimation methods across key metrics.

*Qingqing Fang,Wenxi Lv,Qinliang Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AF-CLIP enhances CLIP's visual representations for zero-/few-shot anomaly detection by focusing on local defects using a lightweight adapter and multi-scale spatial aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require large training samples and lack focus on local anomalies, limiting their effectiveness in zero-/few-shot scenarios.

Method: Introduces a lightweight adapter for anomaly-focused visual features, multi-scale spatial aggregation, and learnable textual prompts. Optimized using a composite objective function.

Result: Demonstrates strong zero-shot detection capability and extends to few-shot scenarios with memory banks.

Conclusion: AF-CLIP is effective and generalizable across diverse industrial and medical datasets.

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and
medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training
samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent
efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task,
they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies,
reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused
CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local
defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes
anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both
class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for
precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve
detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial
aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.
Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts
that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on
auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates
strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot
scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial
and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our
proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Faustinaqq/AF-CLIP.

TL;DR: A zero-shot method improves point cloud registration by using diffusion features from depth images, eliminating the need for training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance point cloud registration accuracy without requiring dedicated training datasets by leveraging diffusion-based techniques.

Method: Project point clouds into depth maps, extract diffusion features, and integrate them with geometric features for refined correspondences.

Result: Significantly improved registration accuracy and robust generalization across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances existing registration techniques and generalizes well, with code available for use.

Abstract: Recent research leveraging large-scale pretrained diffusion models has
demonstrated the potential of using diffusion features to establish semantic
correspondences in images. Inspired by advancements in diffusion-based
techniques, we propose a novel zero-shot method for refining point cloud
registration algorithms. Our approach leverages correspondences derived from
depth images to enhance point feature representations, eliminating the need for
a dedicated training dataset. Specifically, we first project the point cloud
into depth maps from multiple perspectives and extract implicit knowledge from
a pretrained diffusion network as depth diffusion features. These features are
then integrated with geometric features obtained from existing methods to
establish more accurate correspondences between point clouds. By leveraging
these refined correspondences, our approach achieves significantly improved
registration accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not
only enhances the performance of existing point cloud registration techniques
but also exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization of encoding models for novel movie stimuli by combining multimodal features and optimizing model architecture.

Method: Leveraged pretrained models (video, speech, text, vision-text, vision-text-audio), linearly projected features, temporally aligned them to fMRI, and mapped to cortical parcels using shared and subject-specific heads.

Result: Achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085, ranking fourth; a last-minute optimization could have raised it to second.

Conclusion: Combining multimodal features, simple architecture, and thorough model selection enhances generalization for encoding models.

Abstract: We present MedARC's team solution to the Algonauts 2025 challenge. Our
pipeline leveraged rich multimodal representations from various
state-of-the-art pretrained models across video (V-JEPA2), speech (Whisper),
text (Llama 3.2), vision-text (InternVL3), and vision-text-audio
(Qwen2.5-Omni). These features extracted from the models were linearly
projected to a latent space, temporally aligned to the fMRI time series, and
finally mapped to cortical parcels through a lightweight encoder comprising a
shared group head plus subject-specific residual heads. We trained hundreds of
model variants across hyperparameter settings, validated them on held-out
movies and assembled ensembles targeted to each parcel in each subject. Our
final submission achieved a mean Pearson's correlation of 0.2085 on the test
split of withheld out-of-distribution movies, placing our team in fourth place
for the competition. We further discuss a last-minute optimization that would
have raised us to second place. Our results highlight how combining features
from models trained in different modalities, using a simple architecture
consisting of shared-subject and single-subject components, and conducting
comprehensive model selection and ensembling improves generalization of
encoding models to novel movie stimuli. All code is available on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ECG diagnosis relies on outdated datasets and low-accuracy algorithms, limiting effectiveness, especially in resource-limited settings.

Method: Uses a two-step curriculum learning: pre-training on segmentation masks, then fine-tuning on grayscale ECG images, with an ensemble of three models for robustness.

Result: Achieves AUC of 0.9534 and F1 score of 0.7801, outperforming individual models on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset.

Conclusion: The method simplifies CVD diagnosis from ECG images, offering a reliable, automated solution for rapid and accurate diagnosis in urgent cases.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a vital tool for diagnosing heart diseases.
However, many disease patterns are derived from outdated datasets and
traditional stepwise algorithms with limited accuracy. This study presents a
method for direct cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnosis from ECG images,
eliminating the need for digitization. The proposed approach utilizes a
two-step curriculum learning framework, beginning with the pre-training of a
classification model on segmentation masks, followed by fine-tuning on
grayscale, inverted ECG images. Robustness is further enhanced through an
ensemble of three models with averaged outputs, achieving an AUC of 0.9534 and
an F1 score of 0.7801 on the BHF ECG Challenge dataset, outperforming
individual models. By effectively handling real-world artifacts and simplifying
the diagnostic process, this method offers a reliable solution for automated
CVD diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings where printed or
scanned ECG images are commonly used. Such an automated procedure enables rapid
and accurate diagnosis, which is critical for timely intervention in CVD cases
that often demand urgent care.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FROSS is a faster-than-real-time method for generating 3D semantic scene graphs by lifting 2D graphs to 3D and using Gaussian distributions, outperforming existing methods in speed and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D semantic scene graph methods are computationally intensive and not suitable for real-time applications, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: FROSS lifts 2D scene graphs to 3D space, representing objects as 3D Gaussian distributions to avoid intensive point cloud processing.

Result: FROSS achieves superior performance and faster processing than prior methods, validated on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG datasets.

Conclusion: FROSS provides an efficient, real-time solution for 3D semantic scene graph generation, with publicly available implementation and dataset.

Abstract: The ability to abstract complex 3D environments into simplified and
structured representations is crucial across various domains. 3D semantic scene
graphs (SSGs) achieve this by representing objects as nodes and their
interrelationships as edges, facilitating high-level scene understanding.
Existing methods for 3D SSG generation, however, face significant challenges,
including high computational demands and non-incremental processing that hinder
their suitability for real-time open-world applications. To address this issue,
we propose FROSS (Faster-than-Real-Time Online 3D Semantic Scene Graph
Generation), an innovative approach for online and faster-than-real-time 3D SSG
generation that leverages the direct lifting of 2D scene graphs to 3D space and
represents objects as 3D Gaussian distributions. This framework eliminates the
dependency on precise and computationally-intensive point cloud processing.
Furthermore, we extend the Replica dataset with inter-object relationship
annotations, creating the ReplicaSSG dataset for comprehensive evaluation of
FROSS. The experimental results from evaluations on ReplicaSSG and 3DSSG
datasets show that FROSS can achieve superior performance while operating
significantly faster than prior 3D SSG generation methods. Our implementation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel multi-purpose CVD risk assessment method using OCTA images, combining risk prediction with detailed blood factor analysis, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CVD risk assessments lack detailed vascular features and deeper analysis of blood factors, limiting accuracy and clinical utility.

Method: Proposes OCTA-CVD dataset and VAMPIRE model with Mamba-Based Directional and Information-Enhanced Morphological modules for detailed vascular analysis.

Result: Outperforms standard classification backbones, OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models.

Conclusion: The approach enhances CVD risk assessment accuracy and clinical relevance, with publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide,
requiring urgent development of effective risk assessment methods for timely
intervention. While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient
approaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,
the commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
fail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared
with OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically
classify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on
CVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and
clinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD
risk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition
prediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we
introduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a
Vessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement
(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images. Our proposed model aims to extract
crucial vascular characteristics through two key components: (1) a Mamba-Based
Directional (MBD) Module that captures fine-grained vascular trajectory
features and (2) an Information-Enhanced Morphological (IEM) Module that
incorporates comprehensive vessel morphology knowledge. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can surpass standard classification backbones,
OCTA-based detection methods, and ophthalmologic foundation models. Our codes
and the collected OCTA-CVD dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global representations in models like CLIP and SigLIP limit effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, prompting the need for region-level enhancements.

Method: RICE uses a billion-scale region dataset, a Region Transformer layer, and a unified cluster discrimination loss for joint object and OCR learning.

Result: RICE consistently outperforms prior methods on segmentation, dense detection, and MLLM visual perception tasks.

Conclusion: RICE advances region-level visual learning, offering scalable training and superior performance for dense tasks.

Abstract: Learning visual representations is foundational for a broad spectrum of
downstream tasks. Although recent vision-language contrastive models, such as
CLIP and SigLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot performance via large-scale
vision-language alignment, their reliance on global representations constrains
their effectiveness for dense prediction tasks, such as grounding, OCR, and
segmentation. To address this gap, we introduce Region-Aware Cluster
Discrimination (RICE), a novel method that enhances region-level visual and OCR
capabilities. We first construct a billion-scale candidate region dataset and
propose a Region Transformer layer to extract rich regional semantics. We
further design a unified region cluster discrimination loss that jointly
supports object and OCR learning within a single classification framework,
enabling efficient and scalable distributed training on large-scale data.
Extensive experiments show that RICE consistently outperforms previous methods
on tasks, including segmentation, dense detection, and visual perception for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The pre-trained models have been

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework is proposed for real-time adaptation in streaming data, using dynamic prompts and active querying to improve performance under latency and memory constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-time streaming scenarios where only one sample is available at a time, requiring immediate decisions while respecting constraints.

Method: The framework includes a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and class-aware distribution alignment for adaptation.

Result: Demonstrated consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods on 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization datasets, with reasonable latency and memory overhead.

Conclusion: The TTAL framework offers a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous systems and medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FaRMamba addresses medical image segmentation challenges by combining multi-scale frequency transforms and self-supervised reconstruction to improve boundary accuracy and detail preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like blurred boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and long-range structure modeling (DC-LRSS) hinder accurate medical image segmentation.

Method: FaRMamba introduces two modules: MSFM for high-frequency restoration via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms, and SSRAE for pixel-level reconstruction to recover 2D spatial correlations.

Result: FaRMamba outperforms CNN-Transformer hybrids and Mamba variants on datasets like CAMUS, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg, improving boundary accuracy and detail preservation.

Conclusion: FaRMamba offers a flexible, frequency-aware framework for medical image segmentation, addressing core challenges without excessive computational cost.

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without
prohibitive computational overhead. This work provides a flexible
frequency-aware framework for future segmentation models that directly
mitigates core challenges in medical imaging.

Result: Identified factors influencing performance and robustness of the models under various medical data challenges.

Conclusion: Provides recommendations for applying transfer learning and self-supervised learning in medical fields, aiming for efficient deployment.

Abstract: Recently, transfer learning and self-supervised learning have gained
significant attention within the medical field due to their ability to mitigate
the challenges posed by limited data availability, improve model
generalisation, and reduce computational expenses. Transfer learning and
self-supervised learning hold immense potential for advancing medical research.
However, it is crucial to recognise that transfer learning and self-supervised
learning architectures exhibit distinct advantages and limitations, manifesting
variations in accuracy, training speed, and robustness. This paper compares the
performance and robustness of transfer learning and self-supervised learning in
the medical field. Specifically, we pre-trained two models using the same
source domain datasets with different pre-training methods and evaluated them
on small-sized medical datasets to identify the factors influencing their final
performance. We tested data with several common issues in medical domains, such
as data imbalance, data scarcity, and domain mismatch, through comparison
experiments to understand their impact on specific pre-trained models. Finally,
we provide recommendations to help users apply transfer learning and
self-supervised learning methods in medical areas, and build more convenient

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of VLMs producing short, generic captions by identifying and mitigating a bias towards the EOS token during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often generate overly brief captions despite strong vision-language capabilities, limiting their detail.

Method: An unsupervised method is proposed to debias the EOS token tendency, promoting longer, more detailed captions without complex rewards or supervision.

Result: Experiments show increased caption length and detail, though with more hallucinations.

Conclusion: The simple, effective approach enhances caption detail without requiring additional supervision or complex rewards.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.

TL;DR: KB-DMGen improves human image generation by combining Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic Pose Masking to ensure both pose accuracy and overall image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods prioritize pose accuracy but neglect global image quality, which is crucial for realistic portrait generation.

Method: Proposes KB-DMGen, using a Knowledge Base (KB) for pose accuracy and image quality, and Dynamic Masking (DM) to adjust pose-related region importance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset.

Conclusion: KB-DMGen effectively balances pose accuracy and image quality, setting a new benchmark in human image generation.

Abstract: Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on
the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and style specifications, leading to inconsistent visuals.

Method: LPA decomposes prompts into content and style tokens, injecting them selectively into U-Net's attention layers at different stages for better control.

Result: LPA outperforms baselines like Composer and SDXL in CLIP score and style consistency on a custom benchmark.

Conclusion: LPA offers a promising direction for controllable and expressive diffusion-based image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.

*Haoyue Li,Di Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HDST is a novel hyperspectral image denoising framework using frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods struggle with hyperspectral images' unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex noise distributions.

Method: HDST integrates FFT preprocessing, dynamic cross-domain attention, and hierarchical architecture for 3D collaborative processing.

Result: HDST significantly improves denoising performance on real and synthetic datasets while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: The research offers a universal framework for HSI denoising and insights for high-dimensional visual data.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

*Shizuka Akahori,Shotaro Teruya,Pragyan Shrestha,Yuichi Yoshii,Satoshi Iizuka,Akira Ikumi,Hiromitsu Tsuge,Itaru Kitahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reconstruction-based framework using masked autoencoders detects medial epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images by learning normal bone structure, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medial epicondyle avulsion, common in baseball players, involves bone detachment. Detecting it requires understanding normal bone continuity, which existing methods lack.

Method: A masked autoencoder-based framework learns normal bone structure and continuity. It reconstructs images, with large errors indicating avulsion sites.

Result: The method achieved pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and image-wise AUC of 0.967, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects avulsion by leveraging normal bone structure learning, with a publicly available dataset for further research.

Abstract: This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D language models face challenges with sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited accuracy.

Method: Proposes NeuroVoxel-LM, integrating NeRF with Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) and Token-level Adaptive Pooling for Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME).

Result: DR-MSV enhances feature extraction efficiency and accuracy; TAP-LME outperforms max-pooling in semantic representation.

Conclusion: NeuroVoxel-LM advances 3D language models by improving efficiency and accuracy in handling point clouds.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.

TL;DR: A real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework is proposed, integrating a 3D-adaptive SFM Decision Mechanism and Personalized Gait Control Motor to simulate complex human behaviors realistically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evacuation models fail to capture complex human behaviors like collisions, interactions, and terrain-influenced actions, limiting realism in simulations.

Method: The framework aligns with the human brain's SDM flow, using a 3D-adaptive SFM and Personalized Gait Control Motor for dynamic, parallel agent movement. Part-level Force Visualization aids analysis.

Result: The framework enables dynamic trajectory planning, personalized agent behavior, and compatibility with uneven terrain, producing realistic evacuation results.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances realism in crowd evacuation simulations, offering better insights and compatibility with diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

TL;DR: Local2Global is an online video instance segmentation framework using local and global queries with a novel L2G-aligner for temporal consistency, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like noise accumulation, drift, occlusions, and scene transitions in online video segmentation to improve temporal consistency.

Method: Uses DETR-based query propagation with local and global queries, and a lightweight L2G-aligner transformer decoder for early alignment.

Result: Achieves 54.3 AP on Youtube-VIS-19, 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-21, and 37.0 AP on OVIS with ResNet-50.

Conclusion: Local2Global outperforms benchmarks with simple online training, offering smooth transitions and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the overlooked relationship between plant species and disease types in current CNN-based approaches for smart agriculture.

Method: Uses a modified VGG-16 backbone, deep supervision training, and classification chains to predict plant species and disease types jointly.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy and F1-score on Plant Village and PlantDoc datasets compared to multi-model, multi-label, multi-output, and multi-task approaches.

Conclusion: Mo-DsCC is a promising tool for smart agriculture, offering practical benefits and novel insights for industry and academia.

Abstract: Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.

which we extract multi-metric spatial descriptors: principal component
directions, kernel density hotspots, size-depth regression, and Delaunay edge
statistics. We present four representative examples to illustrate key
fragmentation patterns. Experimental results confirm the framework's accuracy,
robustness to small-object crowding, and feasibility for rapid, automated
blast-effect assessment in field conditions.

TL;DR: WMNet addresses misalignments in visible-infrared object detection using wavelet-guided analysis and modality-aware fusion, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent misalignments due to resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies limit visible-infrared object detection performance.

Method: WMNet uses wavelet-based multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion to align and integrate cross-modal features, mitigating noise and misalignment effects.

Result: WMNet outperforms existing methods on DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets, demonstrating robust detection.

Conclusion: WMNet effectively handles cross-modal misalignments, enhancing detection accuracy and robustness in visible-infrared object detection.

Abstract: Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.

TL;DR: The paper addresses brightness mismatch in supervised low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and proposes the GT-mean loss to improve model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brightness mismatch between enhanced images and ground truth misleads supervised LLIE models, yet this issue is often overlooked.

Method: Introduces the GT-mean loss, a probabilistic approach to model image mean values, extending existing LLIE loss functions with minimal computational overhead.

Result: Experiments show consistent performance improvements across methods and datasets when using the GT-mean loss.

Conclusion: The GT-mean loss effectively mitigates brightness mismatch, enhancing supervised LLIE model performance.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visual quality of
images captured under poor lighting conditions. In supervised LLIE research,
there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the
overall brightness of an enhanced image and its ground truth counterpart,
referred to as brightness mismatch in this study. Brightness mismatch
negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in
consistent performance improvements across various methods and datasets.

TL;DR: A lightweight VLM-based framework filters noisy web data to improve training quality, matching or outperforming larger datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating visual data in VLMs introduces data quality challenges; curated examples often outperform larger, noisy datasets.

Method: A compact VLM fine-tuned on high-quality data evaluates and filters training samples for quality and alignment, avoiding extra modules.

Result: Filtered datasets perform as well as or better than larger, noisier datasets.

Conclusion: The method offers a lightweight, robust solution for high-quality vision-language training corpora.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\

Abstract: Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet

TL;DR: The paper introduces LLM-IAVC, a player-centric multimodal prompt generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning, addressing the limitation of existing methods that overlook player identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sports video captioning methods often ignore player identities or inaccurately integrate them due to independent extra information, limiting their practical use.

Method: The proposed LLM-IAVC includes an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) with a player identification network (PIN) and bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM), along with a visual context learning module (VCLM), to generate multimodal prompts for a large language model (LLM).

Result: The model achieves advanced performance on the NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 benchmarks, supported by a new dataset of 9,726 basketball videos.

Conclusion: LLM-IAVC effectively generates identity-aware descriptions by integrating player identities with video content, demonstrated by superior results and a publicly available dataset and code.

Abstract: Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

*Clinton Ansun Mo,Kun Hu,Chengjiang Long,Dong Yuan,Wan-Chi Siu,Zhiyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PUMPS is an autoencoder for Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) enabling motion synthesis tasks like prediction and interpolation without native dataset supervision, outperforming specialized methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion data transfer across skeletons is challenging due to structural differences; TPCs offer compatibility but lack direct motion task learning capabilities.

Method: PUMPS reduces TPCs into feature vectors, uses latent noise for point extraction, and employs linear assignment for reconstruction, avoiding costly attention mechanisms.

Result: PUMPS matches state-of-the-art in pre-training tasks and outperforms specialized methods in denoising and estimation.

Conclusion: PUMPS is a versatile, high-performing solution for TPC-based motion synthesis, generalizing well across tasks.

Abstract: Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a spatial evaluation pipeline and benchmark to assess Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on absolute and 3D spatial understanding, revealing significant gaps compared to human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise spatial perception is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, but VLMs' spatial understanding is underexplored.

Method: A synthetic dataset is created to evaluate VLMs on absolute spatial positions and 3D spatial movements. Experiments compare VLM performance to humans.

Result: Humans perform near-perfectly, while VLMs struggle, achieving human-level performance only on simple tasks and near-zero scores on others.

Conclusion: VLMs have significant room for improvement in spatial understanding, and the synthetic benchmark provides a cost-effective tool for future research.

Abstract: Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on visible and multi-modal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Modaltracker offers efficient, scalable, and high-performance tracking across multiple modalities with a single training scheme.

Abstract: We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

### [75] [MoCTEFuse: Illumination-Gated Mixture of Chiral Transformer Experts for Multi-Level Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20180)
*Li Jinfu,Song Hong,Xia Jianghan,Lin Yucong,Wang Ting,Shao Long,Fan Jingfan,Yang Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCTEFuse is a dynamic multi-level image fusion network using illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral Transformer Experts to balance texture and contrast in fused images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Illumination changes degrade fusion quality, but existing methods ignore this, causing modality bias.

Method: Uses Chiral Transformer Fusion Blocks with asymmetric cross-attention, guided by illumination gating signals, and a competitive loss function for training.

Result: Achieves superior fusion performance and best detection mAP on datasets (70.93% on MFNet, 45.14% on DroneVehicle).

Conclusion: MoCTEFuse effectively addresses illumination issues in fusion, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.

*Saurabh Yadav,Avi Gupta,Koteswar Rao Jerripothula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMwave improves SAM's performance by using wavelet transforms for richer feature extraction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like SAM degrade in complex tasks; current adapter-based fine-tuning lacks effective feature extraction.

Method: SAMwave uses wavelet transforms and complex-valued adapters to extract multi-scale high-frequency features.

Result: SAMwave outperforms existing methods on four low-level vision tasks, showing efficiency and flexibility.

Conclusion: SAMwave is a superior, interpretable method for adapting SAM to complex tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic context for diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped text in natural scenes.

Method: Combines a pre-trained CLIP model with an AFPN for multi-scale feature fusion and introduces a language-vision decoder with cross-modal attention and text-to-pixel contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art F-scores of 84.8% on MLT-2019 and 90.2% on CTW1500.

Conclusion: SAViL-Det effectively enhances text detection by leveraging semantic context and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model
that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual
prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model
combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale
visual feature fusion. The core of the proposed framework is a novel
language-vision decoder that adaptively propagates fine-grained semantic
information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention.
Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark
multi-lingual MLT-2019 dataset and 90.2% on the curved-text CTW1500 dataset.

*Fabrizio Nunnari,Alakshendra Jyotsnaditya Ramkrishna Singh,Patrick Gebhard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates computer vision methods for classifying facial expressions in sign language, focusing on upper/lower face recognition and color normalization. Results show high accuracy (83.8%) and better performance on lower face expressions (79.6%) than upper (77.9%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify computer vision's ability to classify facial expressions in sign language and explore differences in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects.

Method: Uses color normalization (histogram equalization and fine-tuning) and tests recognition on upper/lower face parts.

Result: Achieves 83.8% mean sensitivity, with lower face recognition (79.6%) outperforming upper face (77.9%). Upper face accuracy exceeds human level.

Conclusion: Computer vision effectively classifies facial expressions in sign language, with notable performance differences between upper and lower face regions.

Abstract: The goal of this investigation is to quantify to what extent computer vision
methods can correctly classify facial expressions on a sign language dataset.
We extend our experiments by recognizing expressions using only the upper or
lower part of the face, which is needed to further investigate the difference
in emotion manifestation between hearing and deaf subjects. To take into
account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for
humans, recognition of expressions from the lower half of the face (79.6%) is
higher than that from the upper half (77.9%). Noticeably, the classification
accuracy from the upper half of the face is higher than human level.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on multimodal long context token compression, categorizing methods by modality (image, video, audio) and mechanism, aiming to reduce computational challenges in MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks in MLLMs caused by quadratic complexity of self-attention with long multimodal inputs.

Method: Systematic survey categorizing compression approaches by modality (image, video, audio) and mechanism (transformation, similarity, attention, query-based).

Result: Comprehensive overview of existing methods, highlighting modality-specific redundancies and compression strategies.

Conclusion: The survey consolidates progress, identifies challenges, and inspires future research, with a public repository for updates.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.

*Shuqi Fan,Haoyi Wang,Xianju Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch fusion model for mining area scene classification achieves 83.63% accuracy by combining global and local features through multi-scale and collaborative representation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate scene classification in mining areas is crucial for environmental monitoring and resource planning, but challenges arise from complex spatial layouts and multi-scale characteristics.

Method: The model uses a dual-branch approach: (1) Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch for global feature relationships, (2) Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch for fine-grained details, and (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module to combine features. Multi-loss computation ensures balanced integration.

Result: The model achieves 83.63% accuracy, outperforming other models and excelling in all evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively captures mining area characteristics through global-local feature fusion, demonstrating superior performance in scene classification.

Abstract: Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MECo is a framework for co-speech gesture generation using LLMs, preserving motion-example details while ensuring speech congruence. It outperforms existing methods in FGD, diversity, and similarity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gesture control systems lose rich motion details due to predefined or pseudo-labels. MECo aims to retain these details by leveraging LLMs.

Method: MECo fine-tunes LLMs to interpret speech audio and motion examples, using examples as explicit query contexts for gesture generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in FGD, motion diversity, and example-gesture similarity. Supports diverse input modalities.

Conclusion: MECo offers granular control and high-quality gesture generation, advancing the field with its innovative use of LLMs.

Abstract: The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaMap is a novel framework for efficient temporal modeling in HD map construction, addressing challenges like occlusions and computational overhead. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD maps are crucial for autonomous driving, but existing methods either underutilize temporal data or are computationally expensive.

Method: MambaMap uses a memory bank for historical data, a gating mechanism for efficient state-space integration, and multi-directional scanning for feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and temporal consistency on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets.

Conclusion: MambaMap effectively addresses temporal modeling challenges in HD map construction, offering robust and efficient performance.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, as they
provide precise road information for downstream tasks. Recent advances
highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a global-to-local densification strategy and an energy-guided multi-resolution training framework to improve the efficiency and performance of 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for scene reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The training process of GS suffers from slow convergence due to inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives.

Method: Introduces a global-to-local densification strategy and an energy-guided coarse-to-fine multi-resolution training framework, along with dynamic pruning of unnecessary Gaussian primitives.

Result: Achieves over 2x training speedup with fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance on MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed methods significantly enhance the efficiency and quality of GS-based scene reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnimalClue is a large-scale dataset for species identification from indirect evidence like footprints and feces, addressing a gap in wildlife monitoring. It includes 159,605 annotated images covering 968 species and presents unique challenges for computer vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current wildlife monitoring relies heavily on direct visual features, leaving indirect evidence underexplored despite its importance. AnimalClue aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive dataset for species identification from traces.

Method: The dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes with species-level labels, bounding boxes/segmentation masks, and fine-grained trait information. It covers five categories of indirect clues (footprints, feces, eggs, bones, feathers) across 968 species.

Result: Experiments evaluate vision models on AnimalClue, highlighting challenges in recognizing detailed and subtle visual features from indirect evidence.

Conclusion: AnimalClue fills a critical gap in wildlife monitoring by enabling automated identification of species from indirect evidence, paving the way for improved biodiversity conservation efforts.

Abstract: Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG foundation models lack paradigm-specific adaptations, limiting generalization. MIRepNet addresses this for MI tasks, common in stroke rehab and robotics.

Method: MIRepNet uses a neurophysiologically-informed preprocessing pipeline and hybrid pretraining (self-supervised and supervised) for rapid adaptation to MI tasks.

Result: MIRepNet outperforms state-of-the-art models on five public MI datasets, even with limited data (<30 trials/class).

Conclusion: MIRepNet is a robust, adaptable solution for MI-based BCIs, offering improved accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

Unpaired Multimodal Attention Alignment (U-MAA), a contrastive self-supervised
mechanism integrated into the attention layers to align heterogeneous

*Yooshin Cho,Hanbyel Cho,Janghyeon Lee,HyeongGwon Hong,Jaesung Ahn,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework called controllable feature whitening to mitigate bias in deep neural networks by eliminating linear correlations between features, improving reliability without complex regularization or adversarial learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of AI necessitates trustworthy systems, but deep neural networks often learn spurious correlations from datasets, undermining reliability.

Method: The method quantifies linear correlations via covariance matrices and removes them using a whitening module, avoiding higher-order dependencies. It also handles fairness criteria like demographic parity and equalized odds through re-weighted covariance matrices.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ, WaterBirds, Celeb-A) by balancing utility and fairness.

Conclusion: Controllable feature whitening effectively reduces bias in AI models, offering a simple yet powerful solution without unstable optimization or complex terms.

Abstract: As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.

*Liyuan Zhang,Zeyun Cheng,Yan Yang,Yong Liu,Jinke Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes T$^3$SVFND, a fake news video detection framework using Test-Time Training (TTT) to address distribution shifts, especially in emergency news. It employs a self-supervised MLM task for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news video detection methods struggle with generalization due to distribution shifts, particularly in emergency scenarios.

Method: The framework uses TTT with a self-supervised MLM task, masking words and predicting them using multimodal (audio/video) context.

Result: Experiments show the model's effectiveness, notably for emergency news detection.

Conclusion: T$^3$SVFND improves robustness in fake news video detection, especially for emergencies, by leveraging TTT and multimodal context.

Abstract: The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.

*Qiaosi Yi,Shuai Li,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Yuhui Wu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to improve fine-structure preservation in Real-ISR using stable diffusion models, reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using pre-trained stable diffusion models struggle with fine-structure reconstruction due to aggressive VAE downsampling.

Method: The TVT strategy transfers an 8× downsampled VAE to a 4× one, trains a new decoder and encoder, and optimizes network architectures for efficiency.

Result: TVT improves fine-structure preservation and reduces computational costs compared to other SD-based methods.

Conclusion: The TVT method effectively enhances image details while being computationally efficient, outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Abstract: Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.

### [90] [SWIFT: A General Sensitive Weight Identification Framework for Fast Sensor-Transfer Pansharpening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20311)
*Zeyu Xia,Chenxi Sun,Tianyu Xin,Yubo Zeng,Haoyu Chen,Liang-Jian Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWIFT is a fast, unsupervised framework for adapting pansharpening models to new sensors by identifying and updating only the most sensitive weights, reducing adaptation time significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based pansharpening models degrade in performance for unseen sensors, and full retraining is impractical. SWIFT addresses this by enabling efficient cross-sensor adaptation.

Method: SWIFT uses unsupervised sampling to select 3% of informative target-domain samples, probes a pre-trained model to identify sensitive weights, and updates only those weights.

Result: SWIFT reduces adaptation time to ~1 minute, outperforms direct-transfer baselines, and matches or exceeds full retraining performance on WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

Conclusion: SWIFT is a plug-and-play, efficient solution for cross-sensor pansharpening adaptation, setting a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.

*Chenjian Gao,Lihe Ding,Rui Han,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid pipeline combining 3D Gaussian Splatting and 2D diffusion models for realistic and temporally consistent 3D object insertion in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of inserting 3D objects into videos with realistic lighting and temporal coherence, especially in dynamic scenarios.

Method: Leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting for initial rendering and refines results with a 2D diffusion model, using a shading-driven pipeline to separate and refine intrinsic object properties.

Result: Achieves photorealistic lighting and temporal consistency in dynamic wrist scenes for bracelet insertion.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach synergizes 3D rendering and 2D diffusion, offering a robust solution for realistic video editing.

Abstract: Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIVOTS is a neural network for non-rigid registration in liver surgery, using point clouds to predict deformation, outperforming baselines in robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical navigation in laparoscopic liver surgery by accurately predicting liver deformation despite challenges like noise and limited visibility.

Method: Uses a neural network with geometric feature extraction and deformation-aware cross-attention modules, trained on synthetic biomechanical data.

Result: Superior performance in registration, robustness against noise, large deformation, and varying visibility levels.

Conclusion: PIVOTS advances liver registration methods, with datasets and code made available for fair benchmarking.

Abstract: Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code

*Yanming Xiu,Maria Gorlatova*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR, categorizing them into formats and purposes, introduces a dataset (AR-VIM), and proposes a detection framework (VIM-Sense) achieving high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR virtual content can mislead users through subtle manipulations, necessitating methods to detect and mitigate such attacks.

Method: A taxonomy of VIM attacks is created, and a dataset (AR-VIM) is constructed. A multimodal framework (VIM-Sense) combines vision-language models and OCR for detection.

Result: VIM-Sense achieves 88.94% accuracy and ~7-second latency in detecting attacks, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively detects VIM attacks, enhancing AR security and user trust.

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

### [94] [Generative Pre-training for Subjective Tasks: A Diffusion Transformer-Based Framework for Facial Beauty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20363)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari,Ali chemsa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Diff-FBP, a two-stage framework using generative models for Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP), outperforming existing methods with a PCC of 0.932.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with aesthetic feature alignment due to generic pre-training. The paper aims to improve this by leveraging domain-specific generative pre-training.

Method: A Diffusion Transformer is pre-trained on FFHQ via self-supervised denoising, then its frozen encoder is used as a feature extractor with a fine-tuned regression head for FBP5500.

Result: Diff-FBP achieves a state-of-the-art PCC of 0.932 on FBP5500, surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: Generative pre-training is key for superior feature representation in subjective tasks like FBP.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MagicAnime, a large-scale multimodal dataset for cartoon animation tasks, addressing the scarcity of annotated data and domain gaps between real-world and cartoon videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in generating high-quality cartoon animations due to complex characters, diverse motions, and emotions, compounded by scarce annotated data.

Method: Proposes MagicAnime dataset with 400k video clips for image-to-video, 50k for whole-body annotation, 12k for face animation, and 2.9k for audio-driven tasks, alongside benchmarks (MagicAnime-Bench).

Result: Validated on four tasks, the dataset supports high-fidelity, fine-grained, and controllable animation generation.

Conclusion: MagicAnime effectively bridges the domain gap and supports diverse cartoon animation tasks with its comprehensive dataset and benchmarks.

Abstract: Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.

*Alexandru Brateanu,Raul Balmez,Ciprian Orhei,Codruta Ancuti,Cosmin Ancuti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ModalFormer is a multimodal framework for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) that leverages nine auxiliary modalities and a novel Cross-modal Transformer (CM-T) with CM-MSA to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLIE methods focus on RGB pixel-level transformations, ignoring contextual information from other visual modalities.

Method: ModalFormer integrates nine auxiliary modalities using CM-T and CM-MSA for multimodal fusion and feature reconstruction.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ModalFormer demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal approaches in LLIE, with pre-trained models and results publicly available.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a fundamental yet challenging task due
to the presence of noise, loss of detail, and poor contrast in images captured
under insufficient lighting conditions. Recent methods often rely solely on
pixel-level transformations of RGB images, neglecting the rich contextual
information available from multiple visual modalities. In this paper, we
present ModalFormer, the first large-scale multimodal framework for LLIE that
fully exploits nine auxiliary modalities to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Our model comprises two main components: a Cross-modal Transformer
(CM-T) designed to restore corrupted images while seamlessly integrating
multimodal information, and multiple auxiliary subnetworks dedicated to
multimodal feature reconstruction. Central to the CM-T is our novel Cross-modal
Multi-headed Self-Attention mechanism (CM-MSA), which effectively fuses RGB
data with modality-specific features--including deep feature embeddings,
segmentation information, geometric cues, and color information--to generate
information-rich hybrid attention maps. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate ModalFormer's state-of-the-art performance in
LLIE. Pre-trained models and results are made available at

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic segmentation for autonomous vehicles using deep learning on the Indian Driving Dataset, comparing five models with UNET+RESNET50 achieving the highest MIOU of 0.6496.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles require robust scene understanding, and semantic segmentation is key for identifying drivable areas and objects in unstructured environments like Indian roads.

Method: Five deep learning models (UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet, SegNet) were trained and evaluated using Mean Intersection over Union (MIOU) on the Indian Driving Dataset.

Result: UNET+RESNET50 achieved the highest MIOU of 0.6496, outperforming other models on the challenging dataset.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning models for semantic segmentation in unstructured driving environments, with UNET+RESNET50 showing superior performance.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles are the next revolution in the automobile industry and
they are expected to revolutionize the future of transportation. Understanding
the scenario in which the autonomous vehicle will operate is critical for its
competent functioning. Deep Learning has played a massive role in the progress
that has been made till date. Semantic Segmentation, the process of annotating
every pixel of an image with an object class, is one crucial part of this scene
comprehension using Deep Learning. It is especially useful in Autonomous
Driving Research as it requires comprehension of drivable and non-drivable
areas, roadside objects and the like. In this paper semantic segmentation has
been performed on the Indian Driving Dataset which has been recently compiled
on the urban and rural roads of Bengaluru and Hyderabad. This dataset is more
challenging compared to other datasets like Cityscapes, since it is based on
unstructured driving environments. It has a four level hierarchy and in this
paper segmentation has been performed on the first level. Five different models
have been trained and their performance has been compared using the Mean
Intersection over Union. These are UNET, UNET+RESNET50, DeepLabsV3, PSPNet and
SegNet. The highest MIOU of 0.6496 has been achieved. The paper discusses the
dataset, exploratory data analysis, preparation, implementation of the five
models and studies the performance and compares the results achieved in the
process.

TL;DR: VESPA is a multimodal autolabeling pipeline combining LiDAR and camera data for scalable 3D scene understanding, outperforming class-agnostic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D annotation is costly and labor-intensive; existing LiDAR-based autolabeling lacks semantic granularity and struggles with data limitations.

Method: VESPA fuses LiDAR's geometric precision with camera images' semantic richness using vision-language models for open-vocabulary labeling and quality refinement.

Result: Achieves 52.95% AP for object discovery and 46.54% for multiclass detection on Nuscenes, without needing ground-truth annotations.

Conclusion: VESPA offers a scalable, high-quality solution for 3D autolabeling, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Data collection for autonomous driving is rapidly accelerating, but manual
annotation, especially for 3D labels, remains a major bottleneck due to its
high cost and labor intensity. Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable
alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal
human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric
information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as
sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these
methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic
granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal
autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the
semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection
quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of
novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring
ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP
of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object
detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding.
Code will be available upon acceptance.

evaluate algorithms and datasets, respectively; and (3) A new ID card dataset
was shared with Track 1 teams to serve as the baseline dataset for the training
and optimisation. The Hochschule Darmstadt, Fraunhofer-IGD, and Facephi company
jointly organised this challenge. 20 teams were registered, and 74 submitted
models were evaluated. For Track 1, the "Dragons" team reached first place with
an Average Ranking and Equal Error rate (EER) of AV-Rank of 40.48% and 11.44%
EER, respectively. For the more challenging approach in Track 2, the "Incode"
team reached the best results with an AV-Rank of 14.76% and 6.36% EER,
improving on the results of the first edition of 74.30% and 21.87% EER,
respectively. These results suggest that PAD on ID cards is improving, but it
is still a challenging problem related to the number of images, especially of
bona fide images.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) detection and translation system using a CNN, achieving 99.95% accuracy to bridge communication gaps for deaf and mute communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deaf and mute communities face communication barriers due to a lack of skilled interpreters and accessible technologies, especially in India where ISL solutions are underdeveloped.

Method: A CNN-based model trained on an ISL dataset, integrated with MediaPipe for hand tracking and motion detection, is developed for real-time gesture translation.

Result: The model achieves 99.95% classification accuracy, demonstrating high precision in discerning nuanced visual features of signs.

Conclusion: The system effectively addresses communication challenges for deaf and mute individuals in India, showcasing potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through
hand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as
sign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand
gestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &
mute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human
interaction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant
barriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation
technologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the
Indian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine
learning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf
& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL
are less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a
robust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &
demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of
99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the
nuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is
rigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1
score, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world
applications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe
for precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of
dynamic gestures. This paper provides a detailed account of the model's
architecture, the data preprocessing pipeline & the classification methodology.
The research elaborates the model architecture, preprocessing & classification

*Juan E. Tapia,Christoph Busch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using deep learning and foundational models to predict fitness for duty (alertness) from near-infrared iris images, addressing challenges in dataset creation for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric devices can estimate alertness, but creating datasets for training AI models (e.g., for alcohol, drugs, sleep deprivation) is challenging. Foundational models offer a solution.

Method: Leverages deep learning and self-supervised foundational models to train downstream models with limited labeled data for fitness-for-duty prediction.

Result: Foundational models enable effective training with fewer labeled images, enhancing fitness-for-duty prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Foundational models provide a promising approach to overcome dataset limitations and improve alertness prediction from iris images.

Abstract: Biometric capture devices have been utilised to estimate a person's alertness
through near-infrared iris images, expanding their use beyond just biometric
recognition. However, capturing a substantial number of corresponding images
related to alcohol consumption, drug use, and sleep deprivation to create a
dataset for training an AI model presents a significant challenge. Typically, a
large quantity of images is required to effectively implement a deep learning
approach. Currently, training downstream models with a huge number of images
based on foundational models provides a real opportunity to enhance this area,
thanks to the generalisation capabilities of self-supervised models. This work
examines the application of deep learning and foundational models in predicting
fitness for duty, which is defined as the subject condition related to
determining the alertness for work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a joint learning approach for 3D face reconstruction and talking head synthesis, optimizing FACS-based blendshapes for better quality and lip-sync performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve talking head synthesis by leveraging 3DMM and optimizing blendshapes, addressing limitations of prior methods like 2D landmark fitting or pretrained models.

Method: Jointly learns 3D face reconstruction and talking head synthesis, using FACS-based blendshapes and a novel lip-sync pipeline that decouples chin contours.

Result: Enhanced face generation quality and reduced flickering near the mouth, with improved lip-sync accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach outperforms previous methods by optimizing blendshapes and introducing a robust lip-sync pipeline.

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the effectiveness of 3DMM for talking head synthesis
by jointly learning a 3D face reconstruction model and a talking head synthesis
model. This enables us to obtain a FACS-based blendshape representation of
facial expressions that is optimized for talking head synthesis. This contrasts
with previous methods that either fit 3DMM parameters to 2D landmarks or rely
on pretrained face reconstruction models. Not only does our approach increase
the quality of the generated face, but it also allows us to take advantage of
the blendshape representation to modify just the mouth region for the purpose

that, unlike previous methods, decouples the original chin contour from the
lip-synced chin contour, and reduces flickering near the mouth.

*Zhuokun Chen,Jugang Fan,Zhuowei Yu,Bohan Zhuang,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseVAR is a plug-and-play framework for accelerating next-scale prediction in visual autoregressive modeling by dynamically excluding low-frequency tokens during inference, reducing computational costs without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational overhead in high-resolution stages of next-scale prediction models is a challenge due to the large number of tokens. Low-frequency tokens have minimal impact on image quality and exhibit similarity with neighbors.

Method: SparseVAR uses lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify and exclude low-frequency tokens, preserving fidelity with uniformly sampled anchor tokens.

Result: Achieves up to 2x speedup in models like Infinity-2B with minimal quality degradation.

Conclusion: SparseVAR effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining high image generation quality, making it a practical solution for accelerating next-scale prediction models.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,
exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over
traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by
progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the
computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge
due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce
SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction
that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without
requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation
that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality
in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring
tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale
prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on
high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing
lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving
the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled
anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while
maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable
acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to
a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.

*Sungrae Hong,Kyungeun Kim,Juhyeon Kim,Sol Lee,Jisu Shin,Chanjae Song,Mun Yong Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new MIL method addresses priority issues in clinical diagnosis by using vertical and horizontal hierarchies, improving accuracy for serious symptoms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIL methods ignore priority among pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, limiting clinical utility.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical approach (vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy) to align predictions and prioritize serious symptoms.

Result: Reduces misdiagnosis and effectively prioritizes important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.

Conclusion: The method enhances clinical MIL by addressing priority issues, validated by real-world data and challenging cases.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool
within clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high
performance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches
for clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that
exist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL
models to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation
of MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two
hierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The
proposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and
employs an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate
clinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with
real-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces
misdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.
Further analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and
qualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with
multiple symptoms.

*Shiyang Liu,Dianyi Yang,Yu Gao,Bohan Ren,Yi Yang,Mengyin Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an automated method for aligning and fusing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) sub-maps, improving registration accuracy and fusion quality without manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D-GS sub-map registration rely on manual reference selection and point cloud matching, often degrading rendering quality. This work aims to automate the process and enhance results.

Method: The approach extracts geometric skeletons and uses ellipsoid-aware convolution for robust registration. A multi-factor Gaussian fusion strategy reduces scene element loss.

Result: The method reduces RRE by 41.9% for registration and improves PSNR by 10.11 dB for fusion, demonstrating superior performance on ScanNet-GSReg and Coord datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances 3D scene representation accuracy and consistency, benefiting robotic perception and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)-based scene representation
demonstrates significant potential in real-time rendering and training
efficiency. However, most existing methods primarily focus on single-map
reconstruction, while the registration and fusion of multiple 3D-GS sub-maps
remain underexplored. Existing methods typically rely on manual intervention to
select a reference sub-map as a template and use point cloud matching for
registration. Moreover, hard-threshold filtering of 3D-GS primitives often
degrades rendering quality after fusion. In this paper, we present a novel
approach for automated 3D-GS sub-map alignment and fusion, eliminating the need
for manual intervention while enhancing registration accuracy and fusion
quality. First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and
leverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating
robust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion
strategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.
Experiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For
registration, it achieves a 41.9\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring
more precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,
highlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its
ability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more
consistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and
autonomous navigation.

*Dinh Nam Pham,Eleftherios Avramidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the role of non-manual facial features in automatic sign language recognition (ASLR), finding the mouth to be the most impactful feature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-manual facial features are crucial in sign language but underexplored in ASLR. Prior work lacks systematic analysis of distinct facial regions.

Method: Two deep learning models (CNN-based and transformer-based) were trained on an SLR dataset to evaluate contributions of eyes, mouth, and full face.

Result: The mouth is the most important non-manual feature, significantly improving recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: Facial features, especially the mouth, are essential for improving ASLR systems.

Abstract: Non-manual facial features play a crucial role in sign language
communication, yet their importance in automatic sign language recognition
(ASLR) remains underexplored. While prior studies have shown that incorporating
facial features can improve recognition, related work often relies on
hand-crafted feature extraction and fails to go beyond the comparison of manual
features versus the combination of manual and facial features. In this work, we
systematically investigate the contribution of distinct facial regionseyes,
mouth, and full faceusing two different deep learning models (a CNN-based model
and a transformer-based model) trained on an SLR dataset of isolated signs with
randomly selected classes. Through quantitative performance and qualitative
saliency map evaluation, we reveal that the mouth is the most important
non-manual facial feature, significantly improving accuracy. Our findings
highlight the necessity of incorporating facial features in ASLR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an improved YOLOv8 model for detecting rice spikelet flowering, enhancing accuracy and speed for hybrid rice seed production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of rice flowering time is vital for efficient pollination and higher yields, but automated recognition is challenging due to small spikelet size and complex field conditions.

Method: The study improves YOLOv8 by replacing PANet with BiFPN for better feature fusion and adding a p2 small-object detection head. A dedicated dataset is created using high-resolution RGB cameras and augmentation.

Result: The improved YOLOv8s-p2 achieves 65.9% mAP@0.5, 67.6% precision, 61.5% recall, and 64.41% F1-score, with a speed of 69 f/s, outperforming the baseline.

Conclusion: The model provides an effective, high-accuracy solution for automated monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Abstract: Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in
hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but
also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field
environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small
size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains
challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering
recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet
structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature
utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object
detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss
commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available
datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB
camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated
dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing.
Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an
mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%,
representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively,
over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set,
meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2
offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated
monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores how spatial context impacts sea ice segmentation using multi-task models, finding optimal receptive field sizes vary by data resolution and task. Combining SAR and AMSR2 data improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the optimal spatial context for sea ice segmentation is underexplored, especially for multi-task mapping of concentration, stage of development, and floe size.

Method: Used Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling with varying atrous rates to control receptive field size and capture multi-scale context. Analyzed interactions between spatial context, feature resolution, and input combinations from Sentinel-1 SAR and AMSR2.

Result: Smaller receptive fields work best for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, medium fields for stage of development, and larger fields often degrade performance. SAR-AMSR2 fusion improves results.

Conclusion: Selecting spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties is crucial. The study offers insights for optimizing deep learning in geospatial tasks.

Abstract: Capturing spatial context at multiple scales is crucial for deep
learning-based sea ice segmentation. However, the optimal specification of
spatial context based on observation resolution and task characteristics
remains underexplored. This study investigates the impact of spatial context on
the segmentation of sea ice concentration, stage of development, and floe size
using a multi-task segmentation model. We implement Atrous Spatial Pyramid
Pooling with varying atrous rates to systematically control the receptive field
size of convolutional operations, and to capture multi-scale contextual
information. We explore the interactions between spatial context and feature
resolution for different sea ice properties and examine how spatial context
influences segmentation performance across different input feature combinations
from Sentinel-1 SAR and Advanced Microwave Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) for multi-task
mapping. Using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, we visualize how
atrous rates influence model decisions. Our findings indicate that smaller
receptive fields excel for high-resolution Sentinel-1 data, while medium
receptive fields yield better performances for stage of development
segmentation and larger receptive fields often lead to diminished performances.
The fusion of SAR and AMSR2 enhances segmentation across all tasks. We
highlight the value of lower-resolution 18.7 and 36.5 GHz AMSR2 channels in sea
ice mapping. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate
spatial context based on observation resolution and target properties in sea
ice mapping. By systematically analyzing receptive field effects in a
multi-task setting, our study provides insights for optimizing deep learning
models in geospatial applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes $A^2R^2$, a framework for improving Img2LaTeX conversion using attention-guided refinement and visual reasoning, outperforming baselines and validated by a new dataset and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) underperform in Img2LaTeX tasks due to struggles with fine-grained visual elements, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: The $A^2R^2$ framework integrates attention localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework for self-correction and improved predictions.

Result: $A^2R^2$ outperforms baselines across six metrics, benefits from more inference rounds, and shows strong synergy among its components in ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed $A^2R^2$ framework effectively advances Img2LaTeX conversion, demonstrating practical effectiveness and scalability.

Abstract: Img2LaTeX is a practically significant task that involves converting
mathematical expressions or tabular data from images into LaTeX code. In recent
years, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a variety of visual understanding tasks, owing to their generalization
capabilities. While some studies have explored the use of VLMs for the
Img2LaTeX task, their performance often falls short of expectations.
Empirically, VLMs sometimes struggle with fine-grained visual elements, leading
to inaccurate LaTeX predictions. To address this challenge, we propose
$A^2R^2$: Advancing Img2LaTeX Conversion via Visual Reasoning with
Attention-Guided Refinement, a framework that effectively integrates attention
localization and iterative refinement within a visual reasoning framework,
enabling VLMs to perform self-correction and progressively improve prediction
quality. For effective evaluation, we introduce a new dataset,
Img2LaTex-Hard-1K, consisting of 1,100 carefully curated and challenging
examples designed to rigorously evaluate the capabilities of VLMs within this
task domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that: (1) $A^2R^2$
significantly improves model performance across six evaluation metrics spanning
both textual and visual levels, consistently outperforming other baseline
methods; (2) Increasing the number of inference rounds yields notable
performance gains, underscoring the potential of $A^2R^2$ in test-time scaling
scenarios; (3) Ablation studies and human evaluations validate the practical
effectiveness of our approach, as well as the strong synergy among its core
components during inference.

*Wei Zhuo,Runjie Luo,Wufeng Xue,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BCT-CLIP, a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method that leverages dominating properties via contrastive learning and LLM-based prior knowledge to improve discriminative class-specific representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSL struggles with data scarcity and visual diversity when aligning visual representations to class name embeddings. The paper aims to address this by exploring dominating properties beyond simple class tokens.

Method: The method includes a multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions, an LLM-assisted retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning, and a contrastive learning strategy for property-token learning.

Result: Superior performance on 11 widely used datasets demonstrates improved discriminative class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Conclusion: Exploring dominating properties via contrastive learning and LLM-based prior knowledge advances FSL by enhancing visual diversity and discriminative representation.

Abstract: Few-shot Learning (FSL), which endeavors to develop the generalization
ability for recognizing novel classes using only a few images, faces
significant challenges due to data scarcity. Recent CLIP-like methods based on
contrastive language-image pertaining mitigate the issue by leveraging textual
representation of the class name for unseen image discovery. Despite the
achieved success, simply aligning visual representations to class name
embeddings would compromise the visual diversity for novel class
discrimination. To this end, we proposed a novel Few-Shot Learning (FSL) method
(BCT-CLIP) that explores \textbf{dominating properties} via contrastive
learning beyond simply using class tokens. Through leveraging LLM-based prior
knowledge, our method pushes forward FSL with comprehensive structural image
representations, including both global category representation and the
patch-aware property embeddings. In particular, we presented a novel
multi-property generator (MPG) with patch-aware cross-attentions to generate
multiple visual property tokens, a Large-Language Model (LLM)-assistant
retrieval procedure with clustering-based pruning to obtain dominating property
descriptions, and a new contrastive learning strategy for property-token
learning. The superior performances on the 11 widely used datasets demonstrate
that our investigation of dominating properties advances discriminative
class-specific representation learning and few-shot classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D Gaussian splatting framework for outdoor relighting uses intrinsic image decomposition to handle sunlight, sky radiance, and indirect lighting, enabling diverse shading and dynamic shadows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods compress global illumination into a single latent vector, limiting shading manipulation and shadow effects. This work aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: The approach includes: (1) residual-based sun visibility extraction, (2) region-based supervision with structural consistency loss, and (3) ray-tracing for shadow simulation.

Result: The framework achieves competitive fidelity in novel view synthesis and produces more natural illumination and shadow effects.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances outdoor relighting by enabling precise illumination decomposition and dynamic shadow generation.

Abstract: We propose a 3D Gaussian splatting-based framework for outdoor relighting
that leverages intrinsic image decomposition to precisely integrate sunlight,
sky radiance, and indirect lighting from unconstrained photo collections.
Unlike prior methods that compress the per-image global illumination into a
single latent vector, our approach enables simultaneously diverse shading
manipulation and the generation of dynamic shadow effects. This is achieved
through three key innovations: (1) a residual-based sun visibility extraction
method to accurately separate direct sunlight effects, (2) a region-based
supervision framework with a structural consistency loss for physically
interpretable and coherent illumination decomposition, and (3) a
ray-tracing-based technique for realistic shadow simulation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework synthesizes novel views with
competitive fidelity against state-of-the-art relighting solutions and produces
more natural and multifaceted illumination and shadow effects.

*Yili Li,Gang Xiong,Gaopeng Gou,Xiangyan Qu,Jiamin Zhuang,Zhen Li,Junzheng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2VParser improves text-to-video retrieval by extracting multiview semantic representations and achieving adaptive alignment, addressing partial misalignment in video-text datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align entire video-text representations, ignoring inequivalence of information due to richer video content.

Method: Introduces Adaptive Decomposition Tokens for cross-modal content decomposition and adaptive semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves accurate partial alignment, outperforming direct alignment methods.

Conclusion: T2VParser effectively aligns text and video while leveraging pretrained model knowledge.

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval essentially aims to train models to align visual
content with textual descriptions accurately. Due to the impressive general
multimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,
existing work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text
tasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In
current video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of
the video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.
Therefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations
can result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.
In this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic
representations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment
rather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding
representations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition
Tokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.
The goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video
while retaining the knowledge of pretrained models. Experimental results
demonstrate that T2VParser achieves accurate partial alignment through
effective cross-modal content decomposition. The code is available at

Abstract: Precise automated understanding of agricultural tasks such as disease
identification is essential for sustainable crop production. Recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to further expand the range of
agricultural tasks by facilitating human-model interaction through easy,
text-based communication. Here, we introduce AgroBench (Agronomist AI
Benchmark), a benchmark for evaluating VLM models across seven agricultural
topics, covering key areas in agricultural engineering and relevant to
real-world farming. Unlike recent agricultural VLM benchmarks, AgroBench is
annotated by expert agronomists. Our AgroBench covers a state-of-the-art range
of categories, including 203 crop categories and 682 disease categories, to
thoroughly evaluate VLM capabilities. In our evaluation on AgroBench, we reveal
that VLMs have room for improvement in fine-grained identification tasks.
Notably, in weed identification, most open-source VLMs perform close to random.
With our wide range of topics and expert-annotated categories, we analyze the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning tasks, which are crucial for VQA and robotics.

Method: SpatialVTS trains models to generate location-related tokens (visual thinking) and infer answers through long-term textual thinking, with dataset corrections for better training.

Result: The model shows significant improvement in spatial understanding tasks without additional inputs like masks or depth.

Conclusion: SpatialVTS effectively enhances spatial reasoning in VLMs, addressing limitations in current models.

Abstract: The spatial reasoning task aims to reason about the spatial relationships in
2D and 3D space, which is a fundamental capability for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and robotics. Although vision language models (VLMs) have
developed rapidly in recent years, they are still struggling with the spatial
reasoning task. In this paper, we introduce a method that can enhance Spatial
reasoning through Visual and Textual thinking Simultaneously (SpatialVTS). In
the spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate
location-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically. Not only
are the objects mentioned in the problem addressed, but also the potential
objects related to the reasoning are considered. During the spatial textual
thinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and
dialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To
effectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the
existing spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels
resulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to
enhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical
reasoning details. Without introducing additional information (such as masks or
depth), our model's overall average level in several spatial understanding
tasks has significantly improved compared with other models.

Result: Achieves 87.2% grain separation accuracy at 59 mm/s, though processing rate is limited to 8 grams per minute.

Conclusion: The prototype shows promise for machine vision in grain sorting and offers a modular base for future improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a dynamic

computer vision and pneumatic ejection. The system integrates a YOLOv8-based
detection model that identifies and locates grains on a conveyor belt, together
with a second YOLOv8-based classification model that categorises grains into
six classes: Good, Yellow, Broken, Peeled, Dotted, and Reject. This two-stage

*Chieh-Yun Chen,Min Shi,Gong Zhang,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-Copilot is a training-free multi-agent system using LLMs to automate and refine text-to-image generation, improving quality and alignment while reducing prompt engineering effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models are sensitive to prompt phrasing and lack controllability, requiring iterative refinement without clear feedback. Existing solutions are limited or need additional training.

Method: T2I-Copilot employs three agents: Input Interpreter for prompt parsing, Generation Engine for model selection and generation, and Quality Evaluator for feedback and regeneration.

Result: T2I-Copilot matches commercial models' VQA scores, surpasses FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at lower cost, and outperforms other models by 6.36-9.11%.

Conclusion: The system simplifies prompt engineering, enhances generation quality, and supports autonomous or human-in-the-loop operation, offering a cost-effective alternative.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation
but remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to
repeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While
techniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,
denoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited
controllability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the
generalization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free
multi-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large
Language Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative
refinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while
enhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct
generation. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input
Interpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates
a standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate
model from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual
prompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses
aesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for
potential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also
supporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On
GenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA
score comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses
FLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and
SD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%. Code will be released at:

Method: Proposes Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), which links feature magnitude and recognizability under a cross-entropy loss.

Result: GACL aligns with human perception of quality and extends to natural images and noisy label cleansing.

Conclusion: GACL is a versatile, annotation-free method for quality assessment with wide-ranging applications.

Abstract: As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them
justice (Fig.~\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and
studies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these
badly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$
norm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose
Geometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes
feature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without
the need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature
magnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be
simultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with
theoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the
better the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both
network architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through
a large scale human study of 160,000 \doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the
agreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We
further demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first
time enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL
not only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also
extends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment
(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as
general-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in
vertical problems such as noisy label cleansing. Code will be made publicly
available at github.com/yanglan0225/SketchX-Quantifying-Sketch-Quality.

### [118] [FED-PsyAU: Privacy-Preserving Micro-Expression Recognition via Psychological AU Coordination and Dynamic Facial Motion Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20557)
*Jingting Li,Yu Qian,Lin Zhao,Su-Jing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FED-PsyAU, a framework combining psychological studies and federated learning to improve micro-expression recognition (MER) while addressing privacy and data scarcity issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions (MEs) reveal concealed emotions but face challenges like small datasets, subtle features, and privacy concerns in real-world applications.

Method: The FED-PsyAU framework integrates psychological studies on facial action units (AUs) with a DPK-GAT network for hierarchical feature learning. It uses federated learning to enhance MER across clients without data sharing.

Result: Experiments on standard ME databases show the framework effectively improves MER performance and addresses privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully enhances MER by leveraging psychological priors and federated learning, overcoming data limitations and privacy issues.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial
expressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to
conceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological
counseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small
sample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.
Additionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving
the task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints
largely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research
framework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and
lower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial
muscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these
psychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical
learning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively
enhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework
advances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,
preserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.
Extensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Sangmin Lee,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MemoryTalker synthesizes realistic 3D facial animation from audio without needing extra priors, using a two-stage framework to capture speaking styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods require additional priors like class labels or 3D meshes, limiting practicality and style accuracy.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Memorizing general motion, 2) Animating with audio-driven style features.

Result: Generates personalized facial animation without extra priors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MemoryTalker enhances usability and realism in speech-driven 3D facial animation.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.

*Hyung Kyu Kim,Hak Gu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phonetic context-aware loss to improve speech-driven 3D facial animation by addressing coarticulation issues, resulting in smoother and more natural animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to capture facial motion continuity due to frame-wise reconstruction loss, leading to unnatural outputs.

Method: Introduces a phonetic context-aware loss with viseme coarticulation weights to adaptively prioritize facial movements based on dynamic changes.

Result: Experiments show improved quantitative metrics and visual quality compared to conventional methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling phonetic context-dependent visemes is crucial for natural speech-driven 3D facial animation.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to generate realistic facial movements
synchronized with audio. Traditional methods primarily minimize reconstruction
loss by aligning each frame with ground-truth. However, this frame-wise
approach often fails to capture the continuity of facial motion, leading to
jittery and unnatural outputs due to coarticulation. To address this, we
propose a novel phonetic context-aware loss, which explicitly models the
influence of phonetic context on viseme transitions. By incorporating a viseme
coarticulation weight, we assign adaptive importance to facial movements based
on their dynamic changes over time, ensuring smoother and perceptually
consistent animations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that replacing the
conventional reconstruction loss with ours improves both quantitative metrics
and visual quality. It highlights the importance of explicitly modeling
phonetic context-dependent visemes in synthesizing natural speech-driven 3D
facial animation. Project page: https://cau-irislab.github.io/interspeech25/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LSFDNet, a single-stage image fusion detection algorithm combining SWIR and LWIR for ship detection, addressing limitations of single-modal methods. It introduces MLCF and OE loss for improved performance and creates the NSLSR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ship detection relies on single-modal methods, limiting effectiveness in complex conditions like varying lighting or fog. The paper aims to leverage SWIR and LWIR for better performance.

Method: Proposes LSFDNet, a fusion-detection algorithm with MLCF for feature interaction and OE loss for object semantics. Uses NSLSR dataset for training.

Result: Achieves superior detection performance and visually impressive fused images, validated on two datasets.

Conclusion: LSFDNet effectively combines SWIR and LWIR for robust ship detection, with contributions in fusion, detection, and dataset creation.

Abstract: Traditional ship detection methods primarily rely on single-modal approaches,
such as visible or infrared images, which limit their application in complex
scenarios involving varying lighting conditions and heavy fog. To address this
issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave
infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion
detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature
interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,
achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive
fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images
and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the
Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive
fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple
modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.
Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object
Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object
semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary
fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,
thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a
Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective
SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this
field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion
detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available

### [123] [M-Net: MRI Brain Tumor Sequential Segmentation Network via Mesh-Cast](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20582)
*Jiacheng Lu,Hui Ding,Shiyu Zhang,Guoping Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-Net introduces a Mesh-Cast mechanism and TPS training strategy for sequential MRI tumor segmentation, outperforming existing methods on BraTS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI segmentation models underutilize spatial correlations between adjacent slices, which resemble temporal data in videos.

Method: M-Net uses Mesh-Cast to integrate sequential models and TPS training for pattern learning and feature refinement.

Result: M-Net achieves superior performance on BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets.

Conclusion: M-Net is a robust, temporally-aware solution for MRI tumor segmentation.

Abstract: MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of
3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides
valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet
this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial
correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like"
data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this
gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for
sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism,
which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of
both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the
inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally,
we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential
(TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across
sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach
leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual
information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions,
thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential
segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics,
establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor
segmentation.

*Xinqi Lin,Fanghua Yu,Jinfan Hu,Zhiyuan You,Wu Shi,Jimmy S. Ren,Jinjin Gu,Chao Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HYPIR proposes a novel method for deep image restoration by combining pre-trained diffusion models with adversarial training, achieving high-quality results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (MSE-based, GAN-based, diffusion-based) struggle to balance restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. HYPIR aims to address these challenges.

Method: Initializes with a pre-trained diffusion model and fine-tunes using adversarial training, avoiding diffusion loss and iterative sampling.

Result: HYPIR improves stability, avoids mode collapse, accelerates convergence, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HYPIR offers efficient, high-quality image restoration with rich user control, surpassing previous approaches.

Abstract: Deep image restoration models aim to learn a mapping from degraded image
space to natural image space. However, they face several critical challenges:
removing degradation, generating realistic details, and ensuring pixel-level
consistency. Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including
MSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods. However, they fail to
achieve a good balance between restoration quality, fidelity, and speed. We
propose a novel method, HYPIR, to address these challenges. Our solution
pipeline is straightforward: it involves initializing the image restoration
model with a pre-trained diffusion model and then fine-tuning it with
adversarial training. This approach does not rely on diffusion loss, iterative
sampling, or additional adapters. We theoretically demonstrate that
initializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions
the initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.
Consequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode
collapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial
training. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with
rich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture
richness. Requiring only a single forward pass, it achieves faster convergence
and inference speed than diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments show
that HYPIR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient
and high-quality image restoration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of conventional methods in detecting sophisticated facial manipulations in digital security.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using handcrafted frequency-domain features (e.g., SRM, DCT, ELA, SVD, DFT) alongside RGB inputs to detect deepfakes.

Result: The framework provides richer discriminative information, enhancing detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The hybrid method effectively improves deepfake detection by exploiting both frequency and spatial domain artifacts.

exploits frequency and spatial domain artifacts introduced during image

TL;DR: A lightweight RSSC framework with distilled GFNet and early-exit mechanism improves efficiency on edge devices, achieving faster inference and better energy efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RSSC models struggle to balance accuracy, latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Uses frequency domain distillation on GFNet to reduce size and introduces a dynamic early-exit mechanism for edge DNN models.

Result: Achieves 1.3x speedup in inference and over 40% energy efficiency improvement while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively optimizes performance for edge devices in RSSC applications.

Abstract: As the development of lightweight deep learning algorithms, various deep
neural network (DNN) models have been proposed for the remote sensing scene
classification (RSSC) application. However, it is still challenging for these
RSSC models to achieve optimal performance among model accuracy, inference
latency, and energy consumption on resource-constrained edge devices. In this
paper, we propose a lightweight RSSC framework, which includes a distilled
global filter network (GFNet) model and an early-exit mechanism designed for
edge devices to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, we first
apply frequency domain distillation on the GFNet model to reduce model size.
Then we design a dynamic early-exit model tailored for DNN models on edge
devices to further improve model inference efficiency. We evaluate our E3C
model on three edge devices across four datasets. Extensive experimental
results show that it achieves an average of 1.3x speedup on model inference and
over 40% improvement on energy efficiency, while maintaining high
classification accuracy.

*Dezhi An,Wenqiang Liu,Kefan Wang,Zening Chen,Jun Lu,Shengcai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAMS, a dual-path framework for video anomaly detection, combining multiscale spatiotemporal modeling and cross-modal semantic alignment to address challenges like multiscale dependencies and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video anomaly detection is challenging due to multiscale temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and limited labeled data. The study aims to improve detection by integrating hierarchical feature learning and complementary information.

Method: DAMS uses a dual-path architecture: one path integrates AMTPN (for multiscale temporal features) and CBAM (for attention-based feature enhancement), while the other leverages CLIP for cross-modal semantic alignment.

Result: Experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks show DAMS effectively detects and localizes anomalies.

Conclusion: DAMS successfully combines spatiotemporal and semantic features, demonstrating robust anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing
spatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale
temporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of
labeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging
research problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture
called the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),
which is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient
anomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and
complementary information. The main processing path of this framework
integrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the
Convolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained
representation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features
through a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature
fusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy
distribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention
mapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a
contrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic
alignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order
semantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete
inference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level
semantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the
information fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation
and identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental
results on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness
of the DAMS framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransPrune is a training-free token pruning method for LVLMs, using Token Transition Variation and Instruction-Guided Attention to improve efficiency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs in LVLMs due to excessive visual tokens motivate the need for efficient token pruning methods.

Method: Proposes TransPrune, which assesses token importance via Token Transition Variation (TTV) and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA).

Result: Achieves comparable performance to original LVLMs while reducing inference TFLOPs by over half.

Conclusion: TransPrune offers an efficient, attention-independent solution for token pruning in LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but
face high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,
motivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge
lies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches
rely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they
inherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this
work, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token
transitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations
provides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we
propose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.
Specifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their
importance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which
measures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token
representations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how
strongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal
performance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight
benchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV
alone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,
achieving performance comparable to attention-based methods. The code will be
made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper at

*Hongxu Liu,Xinyu Chen,Haoyang Zheng,Manyi Li,Zhenfan Liu,Fumeng Yang,Yunhai Wang,Changhe Tu,Qiong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for recovering colormaps from 2D scalar field visualizations without legends, using decoupling-and-reconstruction and self-supervised optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in recovering continuous colormaps from visualizations without legends, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy with differentiable color-mapping, reconstruction loss, and cubic B-spline representation for smoothness.

Result: Effective colormap recovery demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets, with applications in colormap adjustment and transfer.

Conclusion: The approach successfully extracts colormaps and generalizes to visualizations with legends or discrete palettes.

Abstract: Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization
can be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color
legend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that
extracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by
simultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a
decoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input
visualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then
reconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To
guide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and
reconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure
strong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a
self-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen
visualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color
ordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap
representation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.
We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset
and a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.
Additionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --
colormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to
visualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color
palettes.

TL;DR: A U-Net-based multimodal architecture predicts future player locations in games, using attention mechanisms for feature communication, enabling applications like bot behavior and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding player movement is key for bot navigation, strategy, and analytics in complex, interactive game environments.

Method: Uses a U-Net-based approach with multimodal feature encoding and multi-head attention for feature communication.

Result: Efficiently leverages heterogeneous game data (images, numerical, categorical) for accurate player location prediction.

Conclusion: The method supports downstream tasks like predictive bot behavior and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting player movement in multiplayer games is crucial
for achieving use cases such as player-mimicking bot navigation, preemptive bot
control, strategy recommendation, and real-time player behavior analytics.
However, the complex environments allow for a high degree of navigational
freedom, and the interactions and team-play between players require models that
make effective use of the available heterogeneous input data. This paper
presents a multimodal architecture for predicting future player locations on a
dynamic time horizon, using a U-Net-based approach for calculating endpoint
location probability heatmaps, conditioned using a multimodal feature encoder.
The application of a multi-head attention mechanism for different groups of
features allows for communication between agents. In doing so, the architecture
makes efficient use of the multimodal game state including image inputs,
numerical and categorical features, as well as dynamic game data. Consequently,
the presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that
rely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot
behavior or player anomaly detection.

Motivation: Accurate defect detection in PV modules is crucial for energy efficiency and reliability.

Method: Uses a supervised deep learning framework with a lightweight SegFormer model, preprocessing steps like resizing and contrast enhancement, and benchmarks against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former.

Result: The SegFormer-based model excels in segmenting small and irregular defects, with superior performance metrics like Dice score and IoU.

Conclusion: The model is efficient for real-time deployment on edge devices and integrates well with drone-based inspection systems for large-scale solar farms.

Abstract: Accurate detection of defects such as hotspots and snail trails in

customised Transformwer encoder and streamlined decoder, and fine-tuned on
annotated images with manually labeled defect regions. To evaluate performance,
we benchmark our model against U-Net, DeepLabV3, PSPNet, and Mask2Former using
consistent preprocessing and augmentation. Evaluation metrices includes
per-class Dice score, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, mean IoU, and pixel accuracy.

*Gergely Dinya,Anna Gelencsér-Horváth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for estimating camera roll and pitch using minimal scene info, like a straight line, in partially calibrated setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a lightweight solution for camera orientation estimation in constrained environments where full calibration isn't feasible.

Method: Uses inverse projection geometry with known intrinsics, fixed camera height, and a single straight reference line (e.g., floor-wall edge) to estimate angles. Includes lens distortion correction.

Result: Accurate estimation of roll and pitch angles without full calibration.

Conclusion: The method is practical for multi-camera systems in constrained settings, offering a simpler alternative to full calibration.

Abstract: We present a derivation for estimating the roll and pitch orientation of a
partially calibrated camera mounted above a planar surface, using minimal scene
information. Specifically, we assume known intrinsic parameters and a fixed
height between the camera and the observed plane. By detecting a single
straight reference line at a known planar distance -- such as the edge between
a floor and a wall -- we estimate the roll and pitch angles via inverse
projection geometry. The method leverages geometric constraints and the camera
model, including lens distortion correction. This approach is suitable for
scenarios where full calibration is impractical and offers a lightweight
alternative for multi-camera systems operating in constrained environments.

*Haowen Li,Zhenfeng Fan,Zhang Wen,Zhengzhou Zhu,Yunjin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel cross-domain image composition method without text prompts, leveraging diffusion models and CLIP features for seamless stylization and improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the under-explored challenge of cross-domain image composition, overcoming stochastic diffusion behavior and style gaps without relying on text prompts.

Method: Uses backward inversion and forward denoising with a multilayer perceptron to integrate CLIP features, employing local cross-attention for stable stylization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, improving LPIPS by 30.5% and CSD by 18.1%.

Conclusion: The method advances cross-domain composition research and applications, with a benchmark dataset provided for evaluation.

Abstract: Image composition has advanced significantly with large-scale pre-trained T2I
diffusion models. Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain
composition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic
nature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to
failures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits
practical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image
composition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural
stylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,
preserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward
inversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also
uses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from
foreground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention
strategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable
stylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark
dataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the
lack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD
metric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and
applications. Code and benchmark at https://github.com/sherlhw/AIComposer.

*Chaowei Chen,Xiang Zhang,Honglie Guo,Shunfang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a style-aware blending and prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework to address deficiencies in weak-strong consistency learning for semi-supervised medical image segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on perturbation schemes but overlook inherent framework limitations, such as separated training data streams and incomplete supervisory information utilization.

Method: The framework includes a style-guided distribution blending module to unify labeled and unlabeled data streams and a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to enhance learning from both weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms existing methods across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks in semi-supervised settings.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses confirmation bias and noise in pseudo-labels, improving semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Weak-strong consistency learning strategies are widely employed in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation to train models by leveraging
limited labeled data and enforcing weak-to-strong consistency. However,
existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various
perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within
the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical
deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation
bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of
supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak
consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and
prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically,
inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between
labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we
design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent
training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong
pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to
encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both
weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse
effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks
under various semi-supervised settings.

TL;DR: MMQ-Net improves emotion recognition from physiological data by addressing incomplete signals and movement artifacts using multi-query mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in emotion recognition include incomplete multi-modal signals and interference from body movements and artifacts.

Method: MMQ-Net integrates modality queries (reconstruct missing data), category queries (focus on emotional features), and interference queries (separate noise).

Result: MMQ-Net outperforms existing methods, especially with highly incomplete data.

Conclusion: MMQ-Net effectively tackles key challenges in emotion recognition, enhancing performance in noisy or incomplete data scenarios.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from physiological data is crucial for mental health
assessment, yet it faces two significant challenges: incomplete multi-modal
signals and interference from body movements and artifacts. This paper presents
a novel Multi-Masked Querying Network (MMQ-Net) to address these issues by
integrating multiple querying mechanisms into a unified framework.
Specifically, it uses modality queries to reconstruct missing data from
incomplete signals, category queries to focus on emotional state features, and
interference queries to separate relevant information from noise. Extensive
experiment results demonstrate the superior emotion recognition performance of
MMQ-Net compared to existing approaches, particularly under high levels of data
incompleteness.

### [136] [Implicit Counterfactual Learning for Audio-Visual Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20740)
*Mingfeng Zha,Tianyu Li,Guoqing Wang,Peng Wang,Yangyang Wu,Yang Yang,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Implicit Counterfactual Framework (ICF) and Multi-Granularity Implicit Text (MIT) to address modality discrepancies in audio-visual segmentation (AVS), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVS methods focus on interaction efficiency but neglect modality representation discrepancies and imbalances, leading to biased cross-modal understanding.

Method: Proposes ICF for unbiased understanding, MIT to bridge modality gaps, and Semantic Counterfactual (SC) with Collaborative Distribution-Aware Contrastive Learning (CDCL) for alignment.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches on three public datasets.

Conclusion: ICF and MIT effectively reduce modality gaps and biases, enhancing AVS performance.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) aims to segment objects in videos based on
audio cues. Existing AVS methods are primarily designed to enhance interaction
efficiency but pay limited attention to modality representation discrepancies
and imbalances. To overcome this, we propose the implicit counterfactual
framework (ICF) to achieve unbiased cross-modal understanding. Due to the lack
of semantics, heterogeneous representations may lead to erroneous matches,
especially in complex scenes with ambiguous visual content or interference from
multiple audio sources. We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)
involving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the
modality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.
Visual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby
marginalizing audio features in the decision-making. To mitigate knowledge
preference, we propose the semantic counterfactual (SC) to learn orthogonal
representations in the latent space, generating diverse counterfactual samples,
thus avoiding biases introduced by complex functional designs and explicit
modifications of text structures or attributes. We further formulate the
collaborative distribution-aware contrastive learning (CDCL), incorporating
factual-counterfactual and inter-modality contrasts to align representations,
promoting cohesion and decoupling. Extensive experiments on three public
datasets validate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

*Yue Zhu,Haiwen Diao,Shang Gao,Jiazuo Yu,Jiawen Zhu,Yunzhi Zhuge,Shuai Hao,Xu Jia,Lu Zhang,Ying Zhang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReSoRA improves LoRA by reducing redundancy in projection matrices, enhancing feature adaptation without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA variants suffer from high representation redundancy due to unrestricted projection matrices, limiting feature adaptation effectiveness.

Method: ReSoRA decomposes low-rank submatrices into subspaces and applies de-redundancy constraints to feature distributions.

Result: ReSoRA consistently boosts PETL methods across datasets and architectures in vision-language retrieval and visual classification.

Conclusion: ReSoRA is a flexible, plug-and-play solution that enhances LoRA's efficiency without added inference overhead.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have delivered strong capability
in Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) by minimizing trainable
parameters and benefiting from reparameterization. However, their projection
matrices remain unrestricted during training, causing high representation
redundancy and diminishing the effectiveness of feature adaptation in the
resulting subspaces. While existing methods mitigate this by manually adjusting
the rank or implicitly applying channel-wise masks, they lack flexibility and
generalize poorly across various datasets and architectures. Hence, we propose
ReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces
and adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.
Specifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into
multiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy
constraints to the feature distributions across different projections.
Extensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently
facilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and
datasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification
benchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly
integrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no
additional inference costs. Code is publicly available at:

*Matan Kichler,Shai Bagon,Mark Sheinin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel computer vision method to infer hidden liquid levels in opaque containers by analyzing surface vibrations, using a speckle-based sensing system and a transformer-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision systems are limited to visible surfaces and cannot determine hidden properties like liquid levels in opaque containers. This work aims to expand computer vision capabilities to address this gap.

Method: A speckle-based vibration sensing system captures 2D grid vibrations remotely. A transformer-based model analyzes vibrations to classify container type and liquid level, invariant to vibration sources.

Result: The method successfully classifies liquid levels in various containers, generalizing to unseen instances and ambient sound sources.

Conclusion: This approach enables remote, non-invasive inspection of liquid levels in opaque containers, advancing computer vision beyond surface-level information.

Abstract: Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and
events. However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to
extracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For
instance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but
it cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to
expand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the
hidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on
their surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill
level of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical
manipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based
vibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D
grid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset
of vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we
develop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and
classifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of
measurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding
correct liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.
Moreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known
classes (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)
and fluid levels. We demonstrate our method by recovering liquid levels from
various everyday containers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KASportsFormer, a transformer-based 3D pose estimation framework for sports, improves performance in complex sports scenarios by incorporating kinematic anatomy-informed features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based methods struggle with sports scenarios due to complex movements, motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.

Method: Introduces BoneExt and LimbFus modules to extract and fuse kinematic motion information in a multimodal manner.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art MPJPE errors of 58.0mm (SportsPose) and 34.3mm (WorldPose).

Conclusion: KASportsFormer enhances 3D pose estimation in sports by leveraging kinematic anatomy, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance
in solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these
approaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall
short of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily
life actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.
Moreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish
in moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions
is becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear
to struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation
framework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature
representation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion
information is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser
(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the
capability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our
method through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and
WorldPose. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results with MPJPE errors of 58.0mm and 34.3mm, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications, addressing the lack of public benchmarks in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV-based object detection lacks a publicly available benchmark for multimodal registration, hindering the development and evaluation of advanced methods.

Method: The dataset includes 7,969 triplets of visible, infrared, and registered visible images, annotated with pixel-level ground truth and imaging condition attributes.

Result: ATR-UMMIM provides a comprehensive dataset with diverse scenarios, high-quality annotations, and support for downstream tasks like object detection.

Conclusion: ATR-UMMIM is expected to advance multimodal registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as
each modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.
However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and
sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a
prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no
publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration
in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and
evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To
bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically
tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This
dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely
registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight
altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and
all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination
conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated
annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each
triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition
attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world
deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide
object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object
categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe
ATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal
registration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios. The datatset

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RRVF framework reduces reliance on curated image-text supervision for MLLMs by using visual feedback and reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods in visual reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs heavily depend on curated image-text supervision, limiting their deep visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces RRVF, a framework using visual feedback and RL training based on the 'Asymmetry of Verification' principle.

Result: RRVF outperforms open-source MLLMs and supervised fine-tuning baselines in image-to-code generation tasks.

Conclusion: Visual feedback-driven systems offer a robust, generalizable path for MLLMs without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive
performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into
enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their
performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of
MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated
image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework
termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to
learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on
the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the
rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We
demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for
optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on
the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a
closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual
feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through
multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be
optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF
substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised
fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely
visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable
reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision. Code will be available

TL;DR: RingMo-Agent is a unified framework for multi-modal RS imagery, handling diverse data sources and tasks via vision-language learning, supported by a large dataset (RS-VL3M).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RS vision-language methods lack versatility for multi-modal, multi-platform data and are limited to basic tasks.

Method: RingMo-Agent uses modality-specific embeddings, task-specific tokens, and a hidden state decoding mechanism for diverse RS tasks.

Result: The model excels in visual understanding and analytical tasks, showing strong generalizability across platforms and modalities.

Conclusion: RingMo-Agent addresses limitations of current methods, offering a robust solution for real-world RS applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) images from multiple modalities and platforms exhibit
diverse details due to differences in sensor characteristics and imaging
perspectives. Existing vision-language research in RS largely relies on
relatively homogeneous data sources. Moreover, they still remain limited to
conventional visual perception tasks such as classification or captioning. As a
result, these methods fail to serve as a unified and standalone framework
capable of effectively handling RS imagery from diverse sources in real-world
applications. To address these issues, we propose RingMo-Agent, a model
designed to handle multi-modal and multi-platform data that performs perception
and reasoning tasks based on user textual instructions. Compared with existing
models, RingMo-Agent 1) is supported by a large-scale vision-language dataset
named RS-VL3M, comprising over 3 million image-text pairs, spanning optical,
SAR, and infrared (IR) modalities collected from both satellite and UAV
platforms, covering perception and challenging reasoning tasks; 2) learns
modality adaptive representations by incorporating separated embedding layers
to construct isolated features for heterogeneous modalities and reduce
cross-modal interference; 3) unifies task modeling by introducing task-specific
tokens and employing a token-based high-dimensional hidden state decoding
mechanism designed for long-horizon spatial tasks. Extensive experiments on
various RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves
effective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but
also exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing
modalities.

TL;DR: Synthetic data, like FairFaceGen, shows promise for training fairer face recognition models but lags in generalization compared to real data. SD35-generated data excels in bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if synthetic data can achieve high accuracy and fairness in face recognition, addressing scalability, privacy, and bias concerns.

Method: Generated balanced synthetic dataset FairFaceGen using Flux.1-dev and SD35, combined with identity augmentation methods (Arc2Face, IP-Adapters). Evaluated on standard and challenging benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, IJB-B/C, RFW).

Result: Synthetic data, especially SD35-generated, mitigates bias but underperforms in generalization on IJB-B/C. Intra-class augmentation quality impacts accuracy and fairness.

Conclusion: Synthetic data, particularly SD35, offers practical guidelines for fairer face recognition systems, though real data still outperforms in generalization.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a promising alternative for training face
recognition (FR) models, offering advantages in scalability, privacy
compliance, and potential for bias mitigation. However, critical questions
remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with
synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias
and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen,
using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable
Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation
methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity
count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when
evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging
IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our
results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real
datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic
datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias
mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class
augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings
provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic
data.

TL;DR: FGump, a gradient boosting framework for forest height estimation using multi-channel SAR and LiDAR, balances accuracy and efficiency, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forest height estimation is vital for climate change and carbon cycle monitoring, with SAR and LiDAR offering key data.

Method: FGump uses gradient boosting with multi-channel SAR and LiDAR GT, avoiding heavy preprocessing and complex architectures.

Result: FGump achieves higher accuracy and lower computational costs compared to SOTA AI and classical methods.

Conclusion: FGump provides a precise, efficient solution for forest height estimation, suitable for practical applications.

Abstract: Accurate forest height estimation is crucial for climate change monitoring
and carbon cycle assessment. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly in
multi-channel configurations, has provided support for a long time in 3D forest
structure reconstruction through model-based techniques. More recently,
data-driven approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have
enabled new opportunities for forest parameter retrieval. This paper introduces
FGump, a forest height estimation framework by gradient boosting using
multi-channel SAR processing with LiDAR profiles as Ground Truth(GT). Unlike
typical ML and DL approaches that require large datasets and complex
architectures, FGump ensures a strong balance between accuracy and
computational efficiency, using a limited set of hand-designed features and
avoiding heavy preprocessing (e.g., calibration and/or quantization). Evaluated
under both classification and regression paradigms, the proposed framework
demonstrates that the regression formulation enables fine-grained, continuous
estimations and avoids quantization artifacts by resulting in more precise
measurements without rounding. Experimental results confirm that FGump
outperforms State-of-the-Art (SOTA) AI-based and classical methods, achieving
higher accuracy and significantly lower training and inference times, as
demonstrated in our results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyID is a novel dataset for forged ID detection, mimicking real-world IDs without legal issues, challenging current detection algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the threat of forged IDs in KYC applications by providing a realistic dataset for developing detection algorithms.

Method: Created FantasyID with diverse ID designs, languages, and real faces, printed and captured with devices for bonafide class, and emulated forgery attacks.

Result: Current detection algorithms (TruFor, MMFusion, etc.) struggle with FantasyID, showing high false negative rates (close to 50%) at a 10% false positive rate.

Conclusion: FantasyID is a robust benchmark for evaluating forgery detection algorithms due to its complexity and realism.

Abstract: Advancements in image generation led to the availability of easy-to-use tools
for malicious actors to create forged images. These tools pose a serious threat
to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust
systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the
development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel
publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics
real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to
previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen
watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages,
and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from
FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting
the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that
could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing
generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms,
such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID
dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to
practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false
positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across
the board on the test set. The evaluation experiments demonstrate that
FantasyID dataset is complex enough to be used as an evaluation benchmark for
detection algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building footprint extraction is crucial for urban planning, land use, and disaster assessment, but existing methods face challenges in capturing spatial interactions efficiently.

Method: The SCA module uses two spatial pooling kernels to encode channels along x and y planes, performing split operations for feature groups, and integrates into a 2D CNN to form SCANet.

Result: SCANet achieves top IoU scores of 91.61% and 75.49% on WHU and Massachusetts datasets, outperforming recent methods.

Conclusion: The SCA module and SCANet offer an efficient solution for semantic feature extraction in building footprint analysis, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Building footprint extraction holds immense significance in remote sensing
image analysis and has great value in urban planning, land use, environmental
protection and disaster assessment. Despite the progress made by conventional
and deep learning approaches in this field, they continue to encounter
significant challenges. This paper introduces a novel plug-and-play attention
module, Split Coordinate Attention (SCA), which ingeniously captures spatially
remote interactions by employing two spatial range of pooling kernels,
strategically encoding each channel along x and y planes, and separately
performs a series of split operations for each feature group, thus enabling
more efficient semantic feature extraction. By inserting into a 2D CNN to form
an effective SCANet, our SCANet outperforms recent SOTA methods on the public
Wuhan University (WHU) Building Dataset and Massachusetts Building Dataset in
terms of various metrics. Particularly SCANet achieves the best IoU, 91.61% and
75.49% for the two datasets. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current few-shot evaluation for CLIP is flawed due to partially transductive settings, as most datasets have been seen by CLIP. This does not reflect true inductive generalization.

Method: A pipeline using unlearning to create true inductive baselines, validated with oracle baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed.

Result: Significant performance drop (-55% on average) in the new inductive setting. The proposed method outperforms 13 baselines in 5880 experiments.

Conclusion: The paper addresses evaluation flaws in CLIP-based few-shot classification, provides a solution via unlearning, introduces new benchmarks, and offers a superior method.

Abstract: CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in
the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP
using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been
benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of
evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization
ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP
model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve
this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true
inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a
significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with
multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle
baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that
consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline
methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the
datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with
different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based
few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new
benchmarks, and provide an improved method.

### [148] [METEOR: Multi-Encoder Collaborative Token Pruning for Efficient Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20842)
*Yuchen Liu,Yaoming Wang,Bowen Shi,Xiaopeng Zhang,Wenrui Dai,Chenglin Li,Hongkai Xiong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: METEOR introduces a progressive pruning framework for multi-encoder vision-language models, reducing redundancy across encoding, fusion, and decoding stages to improve efficiency without significant performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-encoder architectures like CLIP struggle with generalization, while multi-encoder methods are computationally expensive. METEOR aims to balance performance and efficiency.

Method: Uses rank-guided token pruning in encoding, cooperative pruning in fusion, and adaptive pruning in decoding to reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves 76% reduction in visual tokens with only 0.3% average performance drop compared to EAGLE.

Conclusion: METEOR successfully balances efficiency and performance in multi-encoder vision-language models, validated across 11 benchmarks.

Abstract: Vision encoders serve as the cornerstone of multimodal understanding.
Single-encoder architectures like CLIP exhibit inherent constraints in
generalizing across diverse multimodal tasks, while recent multi-encoder fusion
methods introduce prohibitive computational overhead to achieve superior
performance using complementary visual representations from multiple vision
encoders. To address this, we propose a progressive pruning framework, namely
Multi-Encoder collaboraTivE tOken pRuning (METEOR), that eliminates redundant
visual tokens across the encoding, fusion, and decoding stages for
multi-encoder MLLMs. For multi-vision encoding, we discard redundant tokens
within each encoder via a rank guided collaborative token assignment strategy.
Subsequently, for multi-vision fusion, we combine the visual features from
different encoders while reducing cross-encoder redundancy with cooperative
pruning. Finally, we propose an adaptive token pruning method in the LLM
decoding stage to further discard irrelevant tokens based on the text prompts
with dynamically adjusting pruning ratios for specific task demands. To our
best knowledge, this is the first successful attempt that achieves an efficient
multi-encoder based vision language model with multi-stage pruning strategies.
Extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach. Compared with EAGLE, a typical multi-encoder MLLMs, METEOR
reduces 76% visual tokens with only 0.3% performance drop in average. The code

*Ruoyu Fan,Yuhui Wen,Jiajia Dai,Tao Zhang,Long Zeng,Yong-jin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: $S^3$LAM is an RGB-D SLAM system using 2D surfel splatting for efficient and accurate tracking and mapping, outperforming 3D Gaussian-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian-based SLAM systems are inefficient for scene representation. $S^3$LAM aims to improve accuracy and efficiency by focusing on 2D surfel splatting.

Method: Uses 2D Gaussian surfels for scene representation, introduces adaptive surface rendering for real-time optimization, and derives camera pose Jacobians from surfel splatting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: $S^3$LAM provides high-quality geometry reconstruction and efficient tracking, validated by superior experimental results.

Abstract: We propose $S^3$LAM, a novel RGB-D SLAM system that leverages 2D surfel
splatting to achieve highly accurate geometric representations for simultaneous
tracking and mapping. Unlike existing 3DGS-based SLAM approaches that rely on
3D Gaussian ellipsoids, we utilize 2D Gaussian surfels as primitives for more
efficient scene representation. By focusing on the surfaces of objects in the
scene, this design enables $S^3$LAM to reconstruct high-quality geometry,
benefiting both mapping and tracking. To address inherent SLAM challenges
including real-time optimization under limited viewpoints, we introduce a novel
adaptive surface rendering strategy that improves mapping accuracy while
maintaining computational efficiency. We further derive camera pose Jacobians
directly from 2D surfel splatting formulation, highlighting the importance of
our geometrically accurate representation that improves tracking convergence.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate that
$S^3$LAM achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code will be made publicly
available.

*Adil Kaan Akan,Yucel Yemez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for compositional video synthesis using temporally consistent object-centric representations, outperforming existing methods in quality and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-centric approaches lack generative capabilities or ignore explicit object-level structure in videos. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Leverages pose-invariant object-centric slots and conditions them on pretrained diffusion models for high-quality, temporally coherent video synthesis.

Result: Sets new benchmarks in video generation quality and temporal consistency, with intuitive editing capabilities like object insertion or replacement.

Conclusion: Advances interactive and controllable video generation, enabling new possibilities for content creation and dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages
temporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous
work, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches
either lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences
holistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach
explicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric
slots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables
high-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and
offers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,
deletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across
frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks
in video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous
object-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance
closely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this
capability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing
interactive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for
advanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.

### [151] [Ensemble Foreground Management for Unsupervised Object Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20860)
*Ziling Wu,Armaghan Moemeni,Praminda Caleb-Solly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnionCut introduces a robust foreground prior for unsupervised object discovery, addressing challenges in distinguishing foreground/background and determining undiscovered objects. UnionSeg, a distilled version, improves efficiency and accuracy, boosting performance in UOD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UOD methods struggle with unreliable foreground priors and fixed discovery iterations, leading to under/over-segmentation. UnionCut and UnionSeg aim to provide a better solution.

Method: UnionCut uses min-cut and ensemble methods to detect foreground unions. UnionSeg is a distilled transformer for efficient and accurate foreground union detection.

Result: Combining UnionCut or UnionSeg with prior UOD methods improves performance in single object discovery, saliency detection, and self-supervised instance segmentation.

Conclusion: UnionCut and UnionSeg enhance UOD by providing robust foreground priors and adaptive discovery, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D
images without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised
representation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the
absence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)
determining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing
how many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous
solutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is
foreground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the
existing foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed
number of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of
objects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and
well-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that
detects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to
identify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the
foreground union in the image is segmented. In addition, we propose UnionSeg, a
distilled transformer of UnionCut that outputs the foreground union more
efficiently and accurately. Our experiments show that by combining with
UnionCut or UnionSeg, previous state-of-the-art UOD methods witness an increase
in the performance of single object discovery, saliency detection and
self-supervised instance segmentation on various benchmarks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniBrain, a multimodal framework, integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data to improve Alzheimer's diagnosis with high accuracy, robustness, and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rising global prevalence of Alzheimer's disease demands better diagnostic tools that are accurate, generalizable, robust to missing data, and explainable—qualities lacking in current methods.

Method: OmniBrain uses a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout to integrate multiple data types (MRI, radiomics, gene expression, clinical data).

Result: Achieves 92.2% accuracy on ANMerge dataset and 70.4% on MRI-only ADNI dataset, outperforming existing methods. Explainability analyses identify relevant brain regions and genes.

Conclusion: OmniBrain provides a reliable, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease affects over 55 million people worldwide and is projected
to more than double by 2050, necessitating rapid, accurate, and scalable
diagnostics. However, existing approaches are limited because they cannot
achieve clinically acceptable accuracy, generalization across datasets,
robustness to missing modalities, and explainability all at the same time. This
inability to satisfy all these requirements simultaneously undermines their
reliability in clinical settings. We propose OmniBrain, a multimodal framework
that integrates brain MRI, radiomics, gene expression, and clinical data using
a unified model with cross-attention and modality dropout. OmniBrain achieves
$92.2 \pm 2.4\%$accuracy on the ANMerge dataset and generalizes to the MRI-only
ADNI dataset with $70.4 \pm 2.7\%$ accuracy, outperforming unimodal and prior
multimodal approaches. Explainability analyses highlight neuropathologically
relevant brain regions and genes, enhancing clinical trust. OmniBrain offers a
robust, interpretable, and practical solution for real-world Alzheimer's
diagnosis.

Motivation: Address limitations of current VLMs in autonomous driving, such as myopic decision-making and passive perception, to enhance reliability in complex environments.

Method: Introduces a Hybrid-Thinking framework (text-based and tool-based reasoning) and Active Perception with a vision toolkit. Trained via a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing proprietary models like Claude Sonnet 4, with robust decision-making grounded in visual evidence.

Conclusion: DriveAgent-R1 advances autonomous systems by balancing efficiency and reliability, paving the way for safer and smarter solutions.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are advancing autonomous driving, yet their
potential is constrained by myopic decision-making and passive perception,
limiting reliability in complex environments. We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to
tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making.
DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that
adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based
reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to
proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency
and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive
reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models,
such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm
that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual
evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of deep learning-based endoscopic depth estimation methods, covering data, techniques, and applications, with insights into challenges and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a thorough review of recent deep learning-based techniques in endoscopic depth estimation, which is crucial for minimally invasive surgery.

Method: Systematic review of state-of-the-art literature from three perspectives: data, methods (monocular and stereo), and applications, including performance metrics and datasets.

Result: Categorization of techniques by supervision strategies and network architectures, analysis of endoscopic scene challenges, and review of applications in robot-assisted surgery.

Conclusion: Identifies future research directions like domain adaptation and real-time implementation, offering a foundation for advancing the field.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety
and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable
attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics.
Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite
the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on
recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to
bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature.
Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key
perspectives: data, methods, and applications, covering a range of methods
including both monocular and stereo approaches. We describe common performance
evaluation metrics and summarize publicly available datasets. Furthermore, this
review analyzes the specific challenges of endoscopic scenes and categorizes
representative techniques based on their supervision strategies and network
architectures. The application of endoscopic depth estimation in the important
area of robot-assisted surgery is also reviewed. Finally, we outline potential
directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time
implementation, and enhanced model generalization, thereby providing a valuable
starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field.

### [155] [Event-Based De-Snowing for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20901)
*Manasi Muglikar,Nico Messikommer,Marco Cannici,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an event camera-based method for de-snowing images, outperforming traditional methods by 3 dB in PSNR and improving downstream tasks like depth estimation by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather like heavy snowfall disrupts vision systems, and existing methods (image or video-based) suffer from artifacts or high frame rate requirements. Event cameras offer a promising alternative due to their low latency and unique spatio-temporal data.

Method: The method uses event cameras to detect snowflake streaks in spatio-temporal data. An attention-based module identifies occluded background points and recovers their original intensity.

Result: The approach achieves 3 dB higher PSNR for image reconstruction and enables 20% better performance in tasks like depth estimation compared to other de-snowing methods.

Conclusion: The work advances vision system reliability in winter conditions, demonstrating the potential of event cameras for robust, all-weather applications.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions, particularly heavy snowfall, pose significant
challenges to both human drivers and autonomous vehicles. Traditional
image-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they
rely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high
frame rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera
parameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,
making the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network
generalization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing
by using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with
submillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the
presence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions
appear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal
representation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses
on events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded
and use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our
method on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that
overlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,
resulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams. Our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art de-snowing methods by 3 dB in PSNR for
image reconstruction. Moreover, we show that off-the-shelf computer vision
algorithms can be applied to our reconstructions for tasks such as depth
estimation and optical flow, achieving a $20\%$ performance improvement over
other de-snowing methods. Our work represents a crucial step towards enhancing
the reliability and safety of vision systems in challenging winter conditions,
paving the way for more robust, all-weather-capable applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SCORPION, a dataset for evaluating model reliability under scanner variability, and SimCons, a framework to improve scanner generalization in computational pathology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse scanners is critical for real-world adoption of computational pathology, as scanner differences can affect diagnosis and treatment planning.

Method: The authors introduce SCORPION, a dataset with 2,400 aligned patches from 480 tissue samples scanned with 5 scanners, and propose SimCons, a framework combining augmentation-based domain generalization with a consistency loss.

Result: SimCons improves model consistency across scanners without compromising task-specific performance.

Conclusion: The SCORPION dataset and SimCons framework provide resources for evaluating and improving model consistency, setting a new standard for reliability testing in computational pathology.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical
challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in
Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus
calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world
adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per
institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on
scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis
and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on
standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during
training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same
tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset
explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.
SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding
2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the
isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of
model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.
Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines
augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to
explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons
improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising
task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing
SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for
evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a
new standard for reliability testing.

TL;DR: HAMLET-FFD is a hierarchical adaptive multi-modal learning framework for face forgery detection, using bidirectional cross-modal reasoning to improve cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of cross-domain generalization in face forgery detection, as conventional methods fail to learn domain-invariant representations.

Method: Proposes HAMLET-FFD, a framework integrating visual and textual cues via bidirectional fusion, leveraging CLIP's contrastive vision-language model.

Result: Demonstrates superior generalization to unseen manipulations across benchmarks, with distinct embeddings specializing in artifact recognition.

Conclusion: HAMLET-FFD effectively enhances authenticity assessment by aligning visual observations with semantic priors, preserving CLIP's original capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of face manipulation techniques poses a critical
challenge for face forgery detection: cross-domain generalization. Conventional
methods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn
domain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired
Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this
challenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive
vision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge
refinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual
evidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key
innovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity
embeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while
modulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive
prompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with
semantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD
freezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves
CLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior
generalization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual
analyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct
representations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RIS-LAD, the first benchmark for Referring Image Segmentation in Low-Altitude Drone scenarios, addressing challenges like diverse viewpoints and high object density. It proposes SAARN, a network that adaptively routes semantic information to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RIS datasets and methods are designed for high-altitude, static views and fail in Low-Altitude Drone scenarios due to unique challenges like viewpoint diversity and object density.

Method: The authors propose the Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN), which decomposes and routes linguistic features to different network stages. It includes CDLE for early visual-category alignment and ARFM for dynamic semantic cue selection.

Result: RIS-LAD challenges state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and SAARN effectively addresses these challenges, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: RIS-LAD fills a gap in RIS for drone scenarios, and SAARN provides a robust solution for handling its complexities. The dataset and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects
based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in
vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing
applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.
Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and
static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD
views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we
present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD
scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask
triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,
cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in
previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object
drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the
Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly
injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic
information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the
Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with
object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion
Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve
reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD
presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also
demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these
challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2I-QBE, a method combining generative AI (text-to-image) with attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) to enhance query-by-example (QBE) searches for historical documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QBE searches require sample query documents, which may not always be available. ABDIR offers flexibility but lacks integration with QBE. The study explores bridging this gap using generative AI.

Method: Proposes T2I-QBE, leveraging Leonardo.Ai for text-to-image generation to create query images from ABDIR-like attributes. These images are then used in traditional QBE for retrieval.

Result: Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset confirm T2I-QBE's viability for historical document image retrieval.

Conclusion: T2I-QBE successfully integrates generative AI with ABDIR and QBE, offering a novel approach for document image retrieval, particularly for historical documents.

Abstract: Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an
alternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image
retrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require
sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer
users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual
features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of
visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI
to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a
use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize
that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document
images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,
which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough
description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style
attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional
QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the
document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.
Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our
hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document
image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at
utilizing T2I generation for DIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARC-Hunyuan-Video is a 7B-parameter multimodal model for structured video comprehension, excelling in tasks like captioning, summarization, and reasoning, with proven real-world impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack detailed video comprehension for real-world shorts, which are complex and fast-paced, requiring advanced multimodal reasoning.

Method: The model processes visual, audio, and textual signals end-to-end, trained via pre-training, fine-tuning, RL, and stress-tested for efficiency.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance on ShortVid-Bench, improves user engagement, and achieves fast inference (10s for 1-min video on H20 GPU).

Conclusion: ARC-Hunyuan-Video effectively addresses real-world video comprehension challenges and supports diverse applications with high efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on
platforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.
However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,
detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the
cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging
video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due
to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and
audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint
delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal
information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce
ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual
signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The
model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and
summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,
and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation
pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive
regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement
learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative
evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative
comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video
comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for
diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our
model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and
satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress
tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on
H20 GPU.

Method: A two-step landmark-based approach transforms input images to closed mouths, then uses a lip adaptation model with audio to generate lip movements, eliminating the need for masking or identity references.

Result: Experiments on LRS2 and HDTF datasets validate the method's effectiveness, showing improved performance without masking or identity references.

Conclusion: The proposed mask-free approach addresses key limitations of masking-based methods, enhancing audio-lip synchronization and preserving identity details.

Abstract: Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of
talking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without
deteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art
methods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face
is masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned
with the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from
the lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity
reference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common
masking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,
significantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and
identity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image
degrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively
impacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the
audio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation
approach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking
the lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a
two-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,
we provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside
the audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs
neither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct
experiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various
ablation studies to validate our contributions.

### [162] [GTAD: Global Temporal Aggregation Denoising Learning for 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20963)
*Tianhao Li,Yang Li,Mengtian Li,Yisheng Deng,Weifeng Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GTAD, a global temporal aggregation denoising network, to improve 3D scene understanding by effectively leveraging both local and global temporal information from sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic environment perception in autonomous systems inadequately use temporal information, focusing on local interactions and missing global sequence insights.

Method: GTAD introduces a framework combining local temporal features from current frames and global temporal features from historical sequences via a latent denoising network.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmarks show GTAD's superiority in achieving coherent and comprehensive environment understanding.

Conclusion: GTAD effectively aggregates temporal information, enhancing 3D scene perception for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Accurately perceiving dynamic environments is a fundamental task for
autonomous driving and robotic systems. Existing methods inadequately utilize
temporal information, relying mainly on local temporal interactions between
adjacent frames and failing to leverage global sequence information
effectively. To address this limitation, we investigate how to effectively
aggregate global temporal features from temporal sequences, aiming to achieve
occupancy representations that efficiently utilize global temporal information
from historical observations. For this purpose, we propose a global temporal
aggregation denoising network named GTAD, introducing a global temporal
information aggregation framework as a new paradigm for holistic 3D scene
understanding. Our method employs an in-model latent denoising network to
aggregate local temporal features from the current moment and global temporal
features from historical sequences. This approach enables the effective
perception of both fine-grained temporal information from adjacent frames and
global temporal patterns from historical observations. As a result, it provides
a more coherent and comprehensive understanding of the environment. Extensive
experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark and ablation studies
demonstrate the superiority of our method.

### [163] [Adapting Vehicle Detectors for Aerial Imagery to Unseen Domains with Weak Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20976)
*Xiao Fang,Minhyek Jeon,Zheyang Qin,Stanislav Panev,Celso de Melo,Shuowen Hu,Shayok Chakraborty,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a generative AI method using latent diffusion models (LDMs) to synthesize aerial images and labels, improving vehicle detection across diverse geographic regions by addressing domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection in aerial imagery suffers from poor generalization due to domain shifts caused by geographic variability. Existing methods trained on one region often fail in others.

Method: A multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge transfer framework with fine-tuned LDMs synthesizes high-quality aerial images and labels for data augmentation.

Result: The method outperforms supervised, weakly supervised, unsupervised, and open-set detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and over 50% in AP50, respectively. Two new datasets are introduced.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates domain shifts, enhancing vehicle detection performance across diverse regions, supported by new datasets for future research.

Abstract: Detecting vehicles in aerial imagery is a critical task with applications in
traffic monitoring, urban planning, and defense intelligence. Deep learning
methods have provided state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for this application.
However, a significant challenge arises when models trained on data from one
geographic region fail to generalize effectively to other areas. Variability in
factors such as environmental conditions, urban layouts, road networks, vehicle
types, and image acquisition parameters (e.g., resolution, lighting, and angle)
leads to domain shifts that degrade model performance. This paper proposes a
novel method that uses generative AI to synthesize high-quality aerial images
and their labels, improving detector training through data augmentation. Our
key contribution is the development of a multi-stage, multi-modal knowledge
transfer framework utilizing fine-tuned latent diffusion models (LDMs) to
mitigate the distribution gap between the source and target environments.
Extensive experiments across diverse aerial imagery domains show consistent
performance improvements in AP50 over supervised learning on source domain
data, weakly supervised adaptation methods, unsupervised domain adaptation
methods, and open-set object detectors by 4-23%, 6-10%, 7-40%, and more than
50%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial
datasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.

### [164] [LargeMvC-Net: Anchor-based Deep Unfolding Network for Large-scale Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20980)
*Shide Du,Chunming Wu,Zihan Fang,Wendi Zhao,Yilin Wu,Changwei Wang,Shiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LargeMvC-Net is a deep network for scalable multi-view clustering, improving anchor-based methods by integrating optimization principles into its architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anchor-based clustering methods lack optimization-aware designs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: LargeMvC-Net unfolds the optimization problem into three modules (RepresentModule, NoiseModule, AnchorModule) and uses an unsupervised reconstruction loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and scalability on large-scale benchmarks.

Conclusion: LargeMvC-Net bridges the gap in anchor-based clustering by embedding optimization principles into its architecture.

Abstract: Deep anchor-based multi-view clustering methods enhance the scalability of
neural networks by utilizing representative anchors to reduce the computational
complexity of large-scale clustering. Despite their scalability advantages,
existing approaches often incorporate anchor structures in a heuristic or
task-agnostic manner, either through post-hoc graph construction or as
auxiliary components for message passing. Such designs overlook the core
structural demands of anchor-based clustering, neglecting key optimization
principles. To bridge this gap, we revisit the underlying optimization problem
of large-scale anchor-based multi-view clustering and unfold its iterative
solution into a novel deep network architecture, termed LargeMvC-Net. The
proposed model decomposes the anchor-based clustering process into three
modules: RepresentModule, NoiseModule, and AnchorModule, corresponding to
representation learning, noise suppression, and anchor indicator estimation.
Each module is derived by unfolding a step of the original optimization
procedure into a dedicated network component, providing structural clarity and
optimization traceability. In addition, an unsupervised reconstruction loss
aligns each view with the anchor-induced latent space, encouraging consistent
clustering structures across views. Extensive experiments on several
large-scale multi-view benchmarks show that LargeMvC-Net consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and
scalability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces JWB-DH-V1, a dataset and evaluation framework for joint whole-body motion and speech generation, highlighting gaps in current methods and performance disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video generation lacks multi-modal consistency and comprehensive evaluation for whole-body motion and speech.

Method: Introduces JWB-DH-V1, a large-scale dataset with 10,000 identities and 2 million samples, plus an evaluation protocol for joint audio-video generation.

Result: Evaluation shows performance gaps between face/hand-centric and whole-body generation, pointing to future research needs.

Conclusion: The dataset and tools address current limitations and provide a benchmark for advancing joint audio-video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have enabled
photo-realistic short clips, but current methods still struggle to achieve
multi-modal consistency when jointly generating whole-body motion and natural
speech. Current approaches lack comprehensive evaluation frameworks that assess
both visual and audio quality, and there are insufficient benchmarks for
region-specific performance analysis. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Joint Whole-Body Talking Avatar and Speech Generation Version I(JWB-DH-V1),
comprising a large-scale multi-modal dataset with 10,000 unique identities
across 2 million video samples, and an evaluation protocol for assessing joint
audio-video generation of whole-body animatable avatars. Our evaluation of SOTA
models reveals consistent performance disparities between face/hand-centric and
whole-body performance, which incidates essential areas for future research.

*Shen Li,Liuyi Yao,Wujia Niu,Lan Zhang,Yaliang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Security tensors enhance LVLMs' safety by transferring textual safety alignment to visual inputs without altering model parameters, improving rejection of harmful images while maintaining performance on benign tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety mechanisms for text-based LLMs do not extend to visual modalities in LVLMs, leaving them vulnerable to harmful image inputs.

Method: Introduces security tensors—trainable input vectors applied during inference—optimized using a curated dataset of malicious, contrastive benign, and general benign image-text pairs.

Result: Security tensors significantly improve LVLMs' ability to reject harmful visual inputs while preserving performance on benign tasks, activating textual safety layers for visual inputs.

Conclusion: Security tensors effectively bridge the cross-modal safety gap in LVLMs by leveraging textual safety mechanisms for visual processing.

Abstract: Large visual-language models (LVLMs) integrate aligned large language models
(LLMs) with visual modules to process multimodal inputs. However, the safety
mechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual
modalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this
cross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors
applied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These
tensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without
modifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset
containing (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive
benign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the
purpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)
general benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results
demonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance
LVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining
near-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards
hidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully
activate the language module's textual "safety layers" in visual inputs,
thereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.

### [167] [Improving Adversarial Robustness Through Adaptive Learning-Driven Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20996)
*Hayat Ullah,Syed Muhammad Talha Zaidi,Arslan Munir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation method with adaptive learning to improve CNN robustness against adversarial attacks without using adversarial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing adversarial training methods struggle to balance accuracy and robustness.

Method: Train multiple adversarially robust teacher models, then distill their knowledge into a student model using adaptive learning weights based on prediction precision.

Result: The method improves adversarial robustness on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets without adversarial data exposure.

Conclusion: Multi-teacher adversarial distillation with adaptive learning effectively enhances CNN robustness against diverse adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in computer vision but are
susceptible to adversarial attacks, crafted perturbations designed to mislead
predictions. Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between
model accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we
present a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive
learning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple
clones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool
of perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,
these adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the
learning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an
adaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each
model by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling
knowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the
learning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the
capacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure
to adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our
proposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse
experimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our
multi-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,
enhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.

### [168] [Learning Transferable Facial Emotion Representations from Large-Scale Semantically Rich Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21015)
*Licai Sun,Xingxun Jiang,Haoyu Chen,Yante Li,Zheng Lian,Biu Liu,Yuan Zong,Wenming Zheng,Jukka M. Leppänen,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion caption dataset, and EmoCapCLIP, a framework for learning facial emotion representations from natural language captions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional facial emotion recognition systems oversimplify emotions into predefined categories or scales, limiting generalization. Natural language offers richer, more expressive supervision, but lacks large-scale datasets and frameworks to utilize it effectively.

Method: The authors propose EmoCap100K, a dataset with 100,000+ samples of rich emotional captions, and EmoCapCLIP, a global-local contrastive learning framework with cross-modal guided positive mining to leverage multi-level caption information.

Result: The method achieves superior performance on over 20 benchmarks across five tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from semantically rich captions.

Conclusion: The work highlights the potential of using large-scale natural language captions for facial emotion representation learning, offering improved flexibility and expressiveness over traditional methods.

Abstract: Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to
predict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.
This constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,
as it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified
labels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,
expressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much
broader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural
language captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation
learning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:
1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and
2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich
supervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion
caption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured
semantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and
fine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further
propose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive
learning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.
This design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption
information while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related
expressions. Extensive evaluations on over 20 benchmarks covering five tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting the promise of
learning facial emotion representations from large-scale semantically rich
captions. The code and data will be available at
https://github.com/sunlicai/EmoCapCLIP.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Rehab-Pile, a unified archive of rehabilitation datasets, and a benchmarking framework for deep learning methods in rehabilitation motion assessment, aiming to standardize research and improve comparability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks and reproducible methodologies in automated rehabilitation motion assessment limits progress and comparability across studies.

Method: Aggregated existing datasets into Rehab-Pile, proposed a benchmarking framework, and evaluated multiple deep learning architectures for classification and regression tasks.

Result: Extensive benchmarking was conducted, and all datasets, source code, and results were made publicly available to support transparency and reproducibility.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment, promoting reliable and accessible solutions.

Abstract: Automated assessment of human motion plays a vital role in rehabilitation,
enabling objective evaluation of patient performance and progress. Unlike
general human activity recognition, rehabilitation motion assessment focuses on
analyzing the quality of movement within the same action class, requiring the
detection of subtle deviations from ideal motion. Recent advances in deep
learning and video-based skeleton extraction have opened new possibilities for
accessible, scalable motion assessment using affordable devices such as
smartphones or webcams. However, the field lacks standardized benchmarks,
consistent evaluation protocols, and reproducible methodologies, limiting
progress and comparability across studies. In this work, we address these gaps
by (i) aggregating existing rehabilitation datasets into a unified archive
called Rehab-Pile, (ii) proposing a general benchmarking framework for
evaluating deep learning methods in this domain, and (iii) conducting extensive
benchmarking of multiple architectures across classification and regression
tasks. All datasets and implementations are released to the community to
support transparency and reproducibility. This paper aims to establish a solid
foundation for future research in automated rehabilitation assessment and
foster the development of reliable, accessible, and personalized rehabilitation
solutions. The datasets, source-code and results of this article are all

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a large-scale open-source image-editing dataset, to address the lack of publicly available resources for research in instruction-guided image editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary models like GPT-4o limit open-source research due to their closed nature. The authors aim to bridge this gap by providing a high-quality, publicly accessible dataset.

Method: The dataset is constructed by unifying and refining three existing datasets (OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, UltraEdit) using GPT-4o. The process involves regenerating images for better quality and rewriting prompts for clarity.

Result: Fine-tuned models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M achieve competitive performance, surpassing prior open-source methods and narrowing the gap to proprietary models.

Conclusion: The release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M is expected to advance open research in instruction-guided image editing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large multimodal models like GPT-4o have set a new
standard for high-fidelity, instruction-guided image editing. However, the
proprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a
significant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce
GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus
containing more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source
image, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging
the versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular
image-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our
methodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality
and instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve
semantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune
advanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are
exciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive
performance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on
GEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger
instruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.
These scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and
substantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models. We hope the full
release of GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M can help to catalyze further open research in
instruction-guided image editing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in comprehensive analysis of hierarchical 4D scene reconstruction and organize rapidly evolving methods.

Method: Organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence, from low-level 3D attributes to physical constraints.

Result: A structured survey of 4D spatial intelligence methods, identifying challenges at each level.

Conclusion: Highlights key challenges and promising directions for advancing 4D spatial intelligence, with an updated project page for tracking developments.

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been
a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world
applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the
focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,
which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid
advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has
evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,
existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical
structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new
perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D
spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes
(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene
components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction
of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene
components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.
We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and
highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D
spatial intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain an up-to-date

*Maria Emilia Mazzolenis,Ruirui Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WARPP is a training-free framework for LLM-based TOD systems, improving workflow adherence via multi-agent orchestration and runtime personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long, conditional workflows in TOD systems, especially when involving external tools and user-specific info.

Method: WARPP uses multi-agent orchestration (Personalizer + domain-specific agents) to dynamically prune branches and tailor execution paths.

Result: Outperforms non-personalized and ReAct baselines, improving fidelity, tool accuracy, and reducing token usage.

Conclusion: WARPP effectively enhances LLM-based TOD systems without additional training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in task-oriented
dialogue (TOD) systems but often struggle with long, conditional workflows that
involve external tool calls and depend on user-specific information. We present
Workflow Adherence via Runtime Parallel Personalization, or WARPP, a
training-free, modular framework that combines multi-agent orchestration with
runtime personalization to improve workflow adherence in LLM-based systems. By
dynamically pruning conditional branches based on user attributes, the
framework reduces reasoning overhead and narrows tool selection at runtime.
WARPP deploys a parallelized architecture where a dedicated Personalizer agent
operates alongside modular, domain-specific agents to dynamically tailor
execution paths in real time. The framework is evaluated across five
representative user intents of varying complexity within three domains:
banking, flights, and healthcare. Our evaluation leverages synthetic datasets
and LLM-powered simulated users to test scenarios with conditional
dependencies. Our results demonstrate that WARPP outperforms both the
non-personalized method and the ReAct baseline, achieving increasingly larger
gains in parameter fidelity and tool accuracy as intent complexity grows, while
also reducing average token usage, without any additional training.

### [174] [Hypergames: Modeling Misaligned Perceptions and Nested Beliefs for Multi-agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19593)
*Vince Trencsenyi,Agnieszka Mensfelt,Kostas Stathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A review of hypergame theory's applications in multi-agent systems (MAS) highlights its use in modeling subjective perceptions and strategic scenarios, analyzing 44 studies to identify trends, gaps, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical game theory assumptions (rationality, complete information) often fail in real-world MAS due to uncertainty and misaligned beliefs. Hypergame theory addresses these limitations by modeling agents' subjective perceptions.

Method: The paper systematically reviews 44 studies on hypergame theory, introduces agent-compatibility criteria, and develops a classification framework to assess integration patterns.

Result: Findings include the prevalence of hierarchical/graph-based models in deceptive reasoning, limited adoption of HNF-based models, and gaps like lack of formal hypergame languages.

Conclusion: The review provides a roadmap for advancing hypergame theory to improve strategic modeling in dynamic MAS, addressing current gaps and unexplored opportunities.

Abstract: Classical game-theoretic models typically assume rational agents, complete
information, and common knowledge of payoffs - assumptions that are often
violated in real-world MAS characterized by uncertainty, misaligned
perceptions, and nested beliefs. To overcome these limitations, researchers
have proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,
subjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory
extends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective
perceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which
agents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available
actions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of
hypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted
to dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from
cybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general
game-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory
and its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop
agent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to
assess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals
prevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based
models in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical
frameworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including
the limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame
languages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and
agent-agent misalignment. By synthesizing trends, challenges, and open research
directions, this review provides a new roadmap for applying hypergame theory to
enhance the realism and effectiveness of strategic modeling in dynamic
multi-agent environments.

*Jiawen Qi,Chang Gao,Zhaochun Ren,Qinyu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeltaLLM is a training-free framework for efficient LLM inference on edge devices by exploiting temporal sparsity in attention patterns, improving sparsity without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying LLMs on edge devices is challenging due to high computational demands. Existing methods are unsuitable for resource-constrained scenarios.

Method: DeltaLLM uses a delta matrix construction strategy for temporal sparsity and a hybrid attention mechanism combining full and delta attention.

Result: Achieves up to 60% sparsity in prefilling and 57% overall, with slight accuracy improvements or negligible drops on BitNet and Llama models.

Conclusion: DeltaLLM enables efficient edge deployment of LLMs without fine-tuning, integrating seamlessly with existing pipelines.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices remains challenging
due to their quadratically increasing computations with the sequence length.
Existing studies for dynamic attention pruning are designed for hardware with
massively parallel computation capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, and aim at
long context lengths (e.g., 64K), making them unsuitable for edge scenarios. We
present DeltaLLM, a training-free framework that exploits temporal sparsity in
attention patterns to enable efficient LLM inference across both the prefilling
and decoding stages, on resource-constrained edge devices. DeltaLLM introduces
an accuracy- and memory-aware delta matrix construction strategy that
introduces temporal sparsity, and a context-aware hybrid attention mechanism
that combines full attention in a local context window with delta approximation
outside it to increase accuracy. We evaluate our framework on the
edge-device-friendly BitNet-b1.58-2B-4T model and Llama3.2-1B-Instruct model
across diverse language tasks. The results show that on BitNet, our framework
increases the attention sparsity from 0% to 60% during the prefilling stage
with slight accuracy improvement on the WG task, and 0% to 57% across both the
prefilling and decoding stages, with even higher F1 score from 29.63 to 30.97
on SQuAD-v2 task. On the Llama model, it can also achieve up to 60% sparsity
during the prefilling stage and around 57% across both stages with negligible
accuracy drop. These results demonstrate that DeltaLLM offers a promising
solution for efficient edge deployment, requiring no fine-tuning and seamlessly
integrating with existing inference pipelines.

TL;DR: This survey explores alignment techniques for large language models (LLMs), covering methods, trade-offs, state-of-the-art approaches, and evaluation challenges, while highlighting open problems in the field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLMs align with human values is critical due to their societal impact, but achieving this alignment poses significant challenges.

Method: The survey reviews alignment techniques like supervised fine-tuning, preference-based methods, and advanced approaches such as DPO and Constitutional AI, alongside evaluation frameworks.

Result: Preference-based methods outperform basic fine-tuning for nuanced alignment, but challenges like reward misspecification and scalability persist.

Abstract: Due to the remarkable capabilities and growing impact of large language
models (LLMs), they have been deeply integrated into many aspects of society.
Thus, ensuring their alignment with human values and intentions has emerged as
a critical challenge. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
practical alignment techniques, training protocols, and empirical findings in
LLM alignment. We analyze the development of alignment methods across diverse
paradigms, characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between core alignment
objectives. Our analysis shows that while supervised fine-tuning enables basic
instruction-following, preference-based methods offer more flexibility for
aligning with nuanced human intent. We discuss state-of-the-art techniques,
including Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI,
brain-inspired methods, and alignment uncertainty quantification (AUQ),
highlighting their approaches to balancing quality and efficiency. We review
existing evaluation frameworks and benchmarking datasets, emphasizing
limitations such as reward misspecification, distributional robustness, and
scalable oversight. We summarize strategies adopted by leading AI labs to
illustrate the current state of practice. We conclude by outlining open
problems in oversight, value pluralism, robustness, and continuous alignment.
This survey aims to inform both researchers and practitioners navigating the
evolving landscape of LLM alignment.

### [177] [The wall confronting large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19703)
*Peter V. Coveney,Sauro Succi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Scaling laws in large language models (LLMs) limit their prediction uncertainty improvement, making high reliability for scientific standards unattainable. Their learning mechanism may cause error pileup and degenerative AI behavior, exacerbated by spurious correlations. Avoiding this requires prioritizing insight and problem understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why LLMs struggle with improving prediction uncertainty and reliability, and to explore the potential degenerative AI pathways caused by their learning mechanisms.

Method: Analysis of scaling laws in LLMs, their learning mechanisms, and the impact of spurious correlations in large datasets.

Result: LLMs' learning mechanisms lead to error pileup and degenerative behavior, with scaling laws limiting reliability improvements. Spurious correlations worsen these issues.

Conclusion: Avoiding degenerative AI in LLMs requires greater emphasis on insight and structural problem understanding, rather than relying solely on scaling.

Abstract: We show that the scaling laws which determine the performance of large
language models (LLMs) severely limit their ability to improve the uncertainty
of their predictions. As a result, raising their reliability to meet the
standards of scientific inquiry is intractable by any reasonable measure. We
argue that the very mechanism which fuels much of the learning power of LLMs,
namely the ability to generate non-Gaussian output distributions from Gaussian
input ones, might well be at the roots of their propensity to produce error
pileup, ensuing information catastrophes and degenerative AI behaviour. This
tension between learning and accuracy is a likely candidate mechanism
underlying the observed low values of the scaling components. It is
substantially compounded by the deluge of spurious correlations pointed out by
Calude and Longo which rapidly increase in any data set merely as a function of
its size, regardless of its nature. The fact that a degenerative AI pathway is
a very probable feature of the LLM landscape does not mean that it must
inevitably arise in all future AI research. Its avoidance, which we also
discuss in this paper, necessitates putting a much higher premium on insight
and understanding of the structural characteristics of the problems being
investigated.

### [178] [Minding Motivation: The Effect of Intrinsic Motivation on Agent Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19725)
*Leonardo Villalobos-Arias,Grant Forbes,Jianxun Wang,David L Roberts,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines how Intrinsic Motivation (IM) affects RL agents in games, finding it alters behavior and causes reward hacking, while GRM can mitigate some issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Games pose challenges for RL due to sparse rewards. IM helps but introduces reward hacking, whose impact is poorly understood.

Method: Empirical evaluation of three IM techniques and GRM in the MiniGrid environment.

Result: IM increases initial rewards and changes agent behavior; GRM mitigates reward hacking in some cases.

Conclusion: IM impacts RL agent behavior, and GRM offers a partial solution to reward hacking.

Abstract: Games are challenging for Reinforcement Learning~(RL) agents due to their
reward-sparsity, as rewards are only obtainable after long sequences of
deliberate actions. Intrinsic Motivation~(IM) methods -- which introduce
exploration rewards -- are an effective solution to reward-sparsity. However,
IM also causes an issue known as `reward hacking' where the agent optimizes for
the new reward at the expense of properly playing the game. The larger problem
is that reward hacking itself is largely unknown; there is no answer to
whether, and to what extent, IM rewards change the behavior of RL agents. This
study takes a first step by empirically evaluating the impact on behavior of
three IM techniques on the MiniGrid game-like environment. We compare these IM
models with Generalized Reward Matching~(GRM), a method that can be used with
any intrinsic reward function to guarantee optimality. Our results suggest that
IM causes noticeable change by increasing the initial rewards, but also
altering the way the agent plays; and that GRM mitigated reward hacking in some
scenarios.

### [179] [HypKG: Hypergraph-based Knowledge Graph Contextualization for Precision Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19726)
*Yuzhang Xie,Xu Han,Ran Xu,Xiao Hu,Jiaying Lu,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HypKG integrates EHRs with KGs using hypergraph models to improve healthcare predictions by contextualizing knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General KGs lack patient-specific contexts, while EHRs provide rich personal data. Combining these can enhance precision healthcare.

Method: Uses entity-linking to connect KGs with EHRs, then employs hypergraph transformers to learn contextualized representations.

Result: HypKG significantly improves healthcare predictions and adjusts KG representations for better utility.

Conclusion: HypKG effectively bridges KGs and EHRs, enhancing knowledge quality and healthcare accuracy.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are
widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains
where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge
accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing
general factual information often lack the ability to account for important
contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are
crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs)
provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which
provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a
framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate
contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions.
Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from
general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph
model to "contextualize" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally,
we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to
jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients,
fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In
experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG
demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across
multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts,
HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG,
potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge.

### [180] [Integrating Activity Predictions in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19733)
*Alec Scully,Cameron Stockton,Forrest Hare*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using ontology-structured knowledge graphs with BFO and CCO to predict future events, like fishing vessel movements, via Markov chains. It critiques current ontological probability models and proposes treating probabilities as process profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance predictive analytics by leveraging structured ontologies and addressing flaws in current probability models.

Method: Organizes data in knowledge graphs using BFO and CCO, queries results to build Markov chain models, and introduces 'spatiotemporal instant' for structural semantics.

Result: Demonstrates successful prediction of future states (e.g., vessel movements) and integrates probability calculations back into knowledge graphs.

Conclusion: Ontology-structured knowledge graphs with refined probability models improve predictive accuracy and enable better decision-making.

Abstract: We argue that ontology-structured knowledge graphs can play a crucial role in
generating predictions about future events. By leveraging the semantic
framework provided by Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Common Core Ontologies
(CCO), we demonstrate how data such as the movements of a fishing vessel can be
organized in and retrieved from a knowledge graph. These query results are then
used to create Markov chain models, allowing us to predict future states based
on the vessel's history. To fully support this process, we introduce the term
`spatiotemporal instant' to complete the necessary structural semantics.
Additionally, we critique the prevailing ontological model of probability,
which conflates probability with likelihood and relies on the problematic
concept of modal measurements: measurements of future entities. We propose an
alternative view, where probabilities are treated as being about process
profiles, which better captures the dynamics of real world phenomena. Finally,
we demonstrate how our Markov chain based probability calculations can be
seamlessly integrated back into the knowledge graph, enabling further analysis
and decision-making. Keywords: predictive analytics, ontology, Markov chains,
probability, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), knowledge graphs, SPARQL.

### [181] [Can LLMs Solve ASP Problems? Insights from a Benchmarking Study (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19749)
*Lin Ren,Guohui Xiao,Guilin Qi,Yishuai Geng,Haohan Xue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASPBench introduces a benchmark for evaluating LLMs in ASP tasks, revealing their limitations in core ASP solving despite strong performance on simpler tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in ASP tasks, which currently use overly simplified programs and lack support for key ASP features.

Method: Developed ASPBench, a benchmark with three ASP-specific tasks: entailment, verification, and computation. Evaluated 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Result: LLMs perform well on simpler tasks (entailment, verification) but struggle with core ASP solving (computation).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better integration of symbolic reasoning in LLMs for ASP tasks. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful paradigm for non-monotonic
reasoning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
capabilities in logical reasoning. Despite this potential, current evaluations
of LLM capabilities in ASP are often limited. Existing works normally employ
overly simplified ASP programs, do not support negation, disjunction, or
multiple answer sets. Furthermore, there is a lack of benchmarks that introduce
tasks specifically designed for ASP solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ASPBench, a comprehensive ASP benchmark, including three ASP specific tasks:
ASP entailment, answer set verification, and answer set computation. Our
extensive evaluations on ASPBench reveal that while 14 state-of-the-art LLMs,
including \emph{deepseek-r1}, \emph{o4-mini}, and
\emph{gemini-2.5-flash-thinking}, perform relatively well on the first two
simpler tasks, they struggle with answer set computation, which is the core of
ASP solving. These findings offer insights into the current limitations of LLMs
in ASP solving. This highlights the need for new approaches that integrate
symbolic reasoning capabilities more effectively. The code and dataset are

*Rifny Rachman,Josh Tingey,Richard Allmendinger,Pradyumn Shukla,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-objective supply chain optimization model using Markov decision processes and multi-objective RL outperforms single-objective RL and MOEA methods in balancing trade-offs, robustness, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of optimizing supply chains with non-stationary markets while considering economic, environmental, and social factors.

Method: Develops a multi-objective RL model, benchmarked against modified single-objective RL and MOEA, tested on varying network complexities.

Result: The model achieves better trade-offs, robustness (75% higher hypervolume than MOEA), and denser solutions (11x denser than single-objective RL).

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively balances competing objectives, ensuring stable production and inventory while minimizing demand loss.

Abstract: This study develops a generalised multi-objective, multi-echelon supply chain
optimisation model with non-stationary markets based on a Markov decision
process, incorporating economic, environmental, and social considerations. The
model is evaluated using a multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) method,
benchmarked against an originally single-objective RL algorithm modified with
weighted sum using predefined weights, and a multi-objective evolutionary
algorithm (MOEA)-based approach. We conduct experiments on varying network
complexities, mimicking typical real-world challenges using a customisable
simulator. The model determines production and delivery quantities across
supply chain routes to achieve near-optimal trade-offs between competing
objectives, approximating Pareto front sets. The results demonstrate that the
primary approach provides the most balanced trade-off between optimality,
diversity, and density, further enhanced with a shared experience buffer that
allows knowledge transfer among policies. In complex settings, it achieves up
to 75\% higher hypervolume than the MOEA-based method and generates solutions
that are approximately eleven times denser, signifying better robustness, than
those produced by the modified single-objective RL method. Moreover, it ensures
stable production and inventory levels while minimising demand loss.

### [183] [Causality-aligned Prompt Learning via Diffusion-based Counterfactual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19882)
*Xinshu Li,Ruoyu Wang,Erdun Gao,Mingming Gong,Lina Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DiCap, a diffusion-based counterfactual prompt learning framework, to address limitations in existing prompt learning methods by ensuring causally invariant prompts and robust feature generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods lack theoretical grounding, leading to difficulties in achieving causally invariant prompts and robust feature generalization across categories.

Method: DiCap uses a diffusion process to iteratively sample gradients from causal model distributions, generating counterfactuals that meet minimal sufficiency criteria. It employs contrastive learning to refine prompts aligned with causal features.

Result: DiCap excels in tasks like image classification, image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, especially for unseen categories.

Conclusion: DiCap provides a theoretically grounded solution for causally invariant prompt learning, demonstrating superior performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Prompt learning has garnered attention for its efficiency over traditional
model training and fine-tuning. However, existing methods, constrained by
inadequate theoretical foundations, encounter difficulties in achieving
causally invariant prompts, ultimately falling short of capturing robust
features that generalize effectively across categories. To address these
challenges, we introduce the $\textit{\textbf{DiCap}}$ model, a theoretically
grounded $\textbf{Di}$ffusion-based $\textbf{C}$ounterf$\textbf{a}$ctual
$\textbf{p}$rompt learning framework, which leverages a diffusion process to
iteratively sample gradients from the marginal and conditional distributions of
the causal model, guiding the generation of counterfactuals that satisfy the
minimal sufficiency criterion. Grounded in rigorous theoretical derivations,
this approach guarantees the identifiability of counterfactual outcomes while
imposing strict bounds on estimation errors. We further employ a contrastive
learning framework that leverages the generated counterfactuals, thereby
enabling the refined extraction of prompts that are precisely aligned with the
causal features of the data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
our method performs excellently across tasks such as image classification,
image-text retrieval, and visual question answering, with particularly strong
advantages in unseen categories.

### [184] [What Does 'Human-Centred AI' Mean?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19960)
*Olivia Guest*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues that AI is inherently tied to human cognition, analyzing its impact through displacement, enhancement, or replacement of human cognitive labor, and warns against obfuscating this relationship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the relationship between AI and human cognition, emphasizing the need to center human experience in AI development.

Method: Uses examples (e.g., abacus vs. mental arithmetic) and novel definitions to analyze sociotechnical relationships.

Result: Identifies three types of AI impact on human cognition: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and replacement (neutral).

Conclusion: Obfuscating the role of human cognition in AI distorts understanding and hinders human-centered AI development; transparency is crucial.

Abstract: While it seems sensible that human-centred artificial intelligence (AI) means
centring "human behaviour and experience," it cannot be any other way. AI, I
argue, is usefully seen as a relationship between technology and humans where
it appears that artifacts can perform, to a greater or lesser extent, human
cognitive labour. This is evinced using examples that juxtapose technology with
cognition, inter alia: abacus versus mental arithmetic; alarm clock versus
knocker-upper; camera versus vision; and sweatshop versus tailor. Using novel
definitions and analyses, sociotechnical relationships can be analysed into
varying types of: displacement (harmful), enhancement (beneficial), and/or
replacement (neutral) of human cognitive labour. Ultimately, all AI implicates
human cognition; no matter what. Obfuscation of cognition in the AI context --
from clocks to artificial neural networks -- results in distortion, in slowing
critical engagement, perverting cognitive science, and indeed in limiting our
ability to truly centre humans and humanity in the engineering of AI systems.
To even begin to de-fetishise AI, we must look the human-in-the-loop in the
eyes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision achieve high accuracy in extracting PCL features and assigning risk categories, matching GPT-4o performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of PCL features is labor-intensive, hindering large-scale research. Automating this process with LLMs can advance PCL studies.

Method: Two open-source LLMs (LLaMA, DeepSeek) were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per guidelines. Evaluation used human-annotated reports and radiologist reviews.

Result: CoT fine-tuning improved feature extraction accuracy (LLaMA: 97%, DeepSeek: 98%) and risk categorization (F1 scores: LLaMA: 0.95, DeepSeek: 0.94), matching GPT-4o. Radiologist agreement was high (Fleiss' Kappa ~0.89).

Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT supervision enable accurate and efficient PCL phenotyping, comparable to GPT-4o, supporting large-scale research.

Abstract: Background: Manual extraction of pancreatic cystic lesion (PCL) features from
radiology reports is labor-intensive, limiting large-scale studies needed to
advance PCL research. Purpose: To develop and evaluate large language models
(LLMs) that automatically extract PCL features from MRI/CT reports and assign
risk categories based on guidelines. Materials and Methods: We curated a
training dataset of 6,000 abdominal MRI/CT reports (2005-2024) from 5,134
patients that described PCLs. Labels were generated by GPT-4o using
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to extract PCL and main pancreatic duct
features. Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated
CoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline
based on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out
human-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently
reviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact
match accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and
radiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning
improved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%
to 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved
(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no
statistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was
high (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference
with the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT
(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels
on par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT
supervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for
large-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled framework optimizes 6G resource allocation using predicted CSI from environmental sensing, outperforming pilot-based methods by 11.5% in throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of conventional statistical methods in dynamic 6G environments and reduce excessive pilot overhead for real-time CSI.

Method: Uses DTC to predict CSI via environmental sensing and lightweight game-theoretic algorithms for online resource allocation.

Result: Achieves 11.5% higher throughput than pilot-based ideal CSI schemes in simulations.

Conclusion: Proves effective for scalable, low-overhead, environment-aware communication in 6G networks.

Abstract: Emerging applications such as holographic communication, autonomous driving,
and the industrial Internet of Things impose stringent requirements on
flexible, low-latency, and reliable resource allocation in 6G networks.
Conventional methods, which rely on statistical modeling, have proven effective
in general contexts but may fail to achieve optimal performance in specific and
dynamic environments. Furthermore, acquiring real-time channel state
information (CSI) typically requires excessive pilot overhead. To address these
challenges, a digital twin channel (DTC)-enabled online optimization framework
is proposed, in which DTC is employed to predict CSI based on environmental
sensing. The predicted CSI is then utilized by lightweight game-theoretic
algorithms to perform online resource allocation in a timely and efficient
manner. Simulation results based on a digital replica of a realistic industrial
workshop demonstrate that the proposed method achieves throughput improvements
of up to 11.5\% compared with pilot-based ideal CSI schemes, validating its
effectiveness for scalable, low-overhead, and environment-aware communication
in future 6G networks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework combining LLMs with GRAPHYP's network to enhance conversational AI transparency and personalization through structured dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI transparency and trust by making reasoning processes traceable and embedding user preferences into AI decisions.

Method: Introduces D-LLMs with three components: reasoning processes, preference classification, and dialogue approaches for conflict resolution.

Result: A conceptual framework for interpretable AI where users can see and understand how AI reaches conclusions.

Conclusion: Envisions AI systems that are transparent and trustworthy, showing users the reasoning behind answers.

Abstract: This perspective paper explores the future potential of "conversational
intelligence" by examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be combined
with GRAPHYP's network system to better understand human conversations and
preferences. Using recent research and case studies, we propose a conceptual
framework that could make AI rea-soning transparent and traceable, allowing
humans to see and understand how AI reaches its conclusions. We present the
conceptual perspective of "Matching Game Preferences through Dialogical Large
Language Models (D-LLMs)," a proposed system that would allow multiple users to
share their different preferences through structured conversations. This
approach envisions personalizing LLMs by embedding individual user preferences
directly into how the model makes decisions. The proposed D-LLM framework would
require three main components: (1) reasoning processes that could analyze
different search experiences and guide performance, (2) classification systems
that would identify user preference patterns, and (3) dialogue approaches that
could help humans resolve conflicting information. This perspective framework
aims to create an interpretable AI system where users could examine,
understand, and combine the different human preferences that influence AI
responses, detected through GRAPHYP's search experience networks. The goal of
this perspective is to envision AI systems that would not only provide answers
but also show users how those answers were reached, making artificial
intelligence more transparent and trustworthy for human decision-making.

*Müge Fidan,Esra Erdem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to generate personalized solutions for Stable Roommates problems, considering agents' habits, preferences, and friend networks, when traditional stable solutions don't exist.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by real-world applications where stable solutions may not exist, the study aims to find 'good-enough' matchings by incorporating additional agent preferences and networks.

Method: The method involves analyzing agents' habits, habitual preferences, and networks of preferred friends to generate personalized solutions.

Result: The method is illustrated with examples and empirical evaluations, demonstrating its usefulness.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical solution for Stable Roommates problems when traditional stability is unattainable.

Abstract: The Stable Roommates problems are characterized by the preferences of agents
over other agents as roommates. A solution is a partition of the agents into
pairs that are acceptable to each other (i.e., they are in the preference lists
of each other), and the matching is stable (i.e., there do not exist any two
agents who prefer each other to their roommates, and thus block the matching).
Motivated by real-world applications, and considering that stable roommates
problems do not always have solutions, we continue our studies to compute
"good-enough" matchings. In addition to the agents' habits and habitual
preferences, we consider their networks of preferred friends, and introduce a
method to generate personalized solutions to stable roommates problems. We
illustrate the usefulness of our method with examples and empirical
evaluations.

*Sarat Chandra Bobbili,Ujwal Dinesha,Dheeraj Narasimha,Srinivas Shakkottai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PITA introduces a framework for aligning LLM outputs with user preferences during inference, eliminating the need for a pre-trained reward model by directly integrating preference feedback into token generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on pre-trained reward models, which can be unstable due to dependency on human preference feedback. PITA aims to bypass this limitation.

Method: PITA learns a small preference-based guidance policy to modify token probabilities during inference without LLM fine-tuning, using stochastic search and iterative refinement.

Result: PITA is evaluated on tasks like mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, showing effective alignment with user preferences.

Conclusion: PITA offers a computationally efficient and stable alternative to reward model-dependent methods for aligning LLM outputs.

Abstract: Inference-time alignment enables large language models (LLMs) to generate
outputs aligned with end-user preferences without further training. Recent
post-training methods achieve this by using small guidance models to modify
token generation during inference. These methods typically optimize a reward
function KL-regularized by the original LLM taken as the reference policy. A
critical limitation, however, is their dependence on a pre-trained reward
model, which requires fitting to human preference feedback--a potentially
unstable process. In contrast, we introduce PITA, a novel framework that
integrates preference feedback directly into the LLM's token generation,
eliminating the need for a reward model. PITA learns a small preference-based
guidance policy to modify token probabilities at inference time without LLM
fine-tuning, reducing computational cost and bypassing the pre-trained reward
model dependency. The problem is framed as identifying an underlying preference
distribution, solved through stochastic search and iterative refinement of the
preference-based guidance model. We evaluate PITA across diverse tasks,
including mathematical reasoning and sentiment classification, demonstrating
its effectiveness in aligning LLM outputs with user preferences.

Motivation: Current NN-based MARL lacks transparency and interoperability, with unclear cooperative mechanisms due to black-box networks.

Method: Proposes CMQ, a value-based method using supervised vectors for cooperation concepts, enhancing interpretability and representation capacity.

Result: CMQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in StarCraft II and LBF, offering better cooperation concept representation and bias detection.

Conclusion: CMQ bridges the performance-interpretability gap in MARL, enabling trustworthy and transparent cooperative learning.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in applying neural networks (NN) to multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) areas, they still largely suffer from a lack of
transparency and interoperability. However, its implicit cooperative mechanism
is not yet fully understood due to black-box networks. In this work, we study
an interpretable value decomposition framework via concept bottleneck models,
which promote trustworthiness by conditioning credit assignment on an
intermediate level of human-like cooperation concepts. To address this problem,
we propose a novel value-based method, named Concepts learning for Multi-agent
Q-learning (CMQ), that goes beyond the current performance-vs-interpretability
trade-off by learning interpretable cooperation concepts. CMQ represents each
cooperation concept as a supervised vector, as opposed to existing models where
the information flowing through their end-to-end mechanism is concept-agnostic.
Intuitively, using individual action value conditioning on global state
embeddings to represent each concept allows for extra cooperation
representation capacity. Empirical evaluations on the StarCraft II
micromanagement challenge and level-based foraging (LBF) show that CMQ achieves
superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. The
results also demonstrate that CMQ provides more cooperation concept
representation capturing meaningful cooperation modes, and supports test-time
concept interventions for detecting potential biases of cooperation mode and
identifying spurious artifacts that impact cooperation.

### [191] [The Policy Cliff: A Theoretical Analysis of Reward-Policy Maps in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20150)
*Xingcheng Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mathematical framework to explain policy brittleness in RL for LLMs/LRMs, attributing it to non-unique optimal actions and incomplete/noisy rewards. It extends this to multi-reward RL, showing how entropy regularization stabilizes policies, and validates findings empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the brittleness and instability of RL policies in LLMs/LRMs, which lead to trust and safety issues like spurious reasoning and deceptive alignment, currently lacking a unified theoretical explanation.

Method: Develops a rigorous mathematical framework analyzing the reward-to-policy mapping stability, extends it to multi-reward RL, and uses entropy regularization to restore stability. Validates through perturbation experiments.

Result: Provides a unified explanation for RL failures, shows entropy regularization stabilizes policies, and validates the framework empirically.

Conclusion: Advances policy-stability analysis from heuristics to theory, offering insights for safer AI design.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
large language and reasoning models (LLMs/LRMs). However, it often produces
brittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious
reasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the
trustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified
theoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the
stability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show
that policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common
occurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This
theoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly
disparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards
that may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action
degeneracy. We extend this analysis from the fundamental single-reward setting
to the more realistic multi-reward RL across diverse domains, showing how
stability is governed by an "effective reward" aggregation mechanism. We also
prove that entropy regularization restores policy stability at the cost of
increased stochasticity. Our framework provides a unified explanation for
recent empirical findings on deceptive reasoning, instruction-following
trade-offs, and RLHF-induced sophistry, and is further validated through
perturbation experiments in multi-reward RL. This work advances
policy-stability analysis from empirical heuristics towards a principled
theory, offering essential insights for designing safer and more trustworthy AI
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HFrame is a GNN-based framework for subgraph homomorphism, outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph homomorphism is complex due to non-one-to-one mappings, and existing methods lack efficiency.

Method: HFrame combines traditional algorithms with GNNs to solve subgraph homomorphism.

Result: HFrame is 101.91x faster than exact algorithms and achieves 0.962 accuracy.

Conclusion: HFrame effectively addresses subgraph homomorphism with improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: Homomorphism is a key mapping technique between graphs that preserves their
structure. Given a graph and a pattern, the subgraph homomorphism problem
involves finding a mapping from the pattern to the graph, ensuring that
adjacent vertices in the pattern are mapped to adjacent vertices in the graph.
Unlike subgraph isomorphism, which requires a one-to-one mapping, homomorphism
allows multiple vertices in the pattern to map to the same vertex in the graph,
making it more complex. We propose HFrame, the first graph neural network-based
framework for subgraph homomorphism, which integrates traditional algorithms
with machine learning techniques. We demonstrate that HFrame outperforms
standard graph neural networks by being able to distinguish more graph pairs
where the pattern is not homomorphic to the graph. Additionally, we provide a
generalization error bound for HFrame. Through experiments on both real-world
and synthetic graphs, we show that HFrame is up to 101.91 times faster than
exact matching algorithms and achieves an average accuracy of 0.962.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional R&D methods are slow, manual, and fragmented, relying heavily on domain expertise and incomplete data sources.

Result: The system provides comprehensive insights into technical novelty, feasibility, scalability, and sustainability, reducing manual effort and speeding up innovation.

Conclusion: The AI-driven platform enhances R&D decision-making by automating and improving the efficiency of technology scouting and solution discovery.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of an AI powered software platform that
leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform technology
scouting and solution discovery in industrial R&D. Traditional approaches to
solving complex research and development challenges are often time consuming,
manually driven, and heavily dependent on domain specific expertise. These
methods typically involve navigating fragmented sources such as patent
repositories, commercial product catalogs, and competitor data, leading to
inefficiencies and incomplete insights. The proposed platform utilizes cutting
edge LLM capabilities including semantic understanding, contextual reasoning,
and cross-domain knowledge extraction to interpret problem statements and
retrieve high-quality, sustainable solutions. The system processes unstructured
patent texts, such as claims and technical descriptions, and systematically
extracts potential innovations aligned with the given problem context. These
solutions are then algorithmically organized under standardized technical
categories and subcategories to ensure clarity and relevance across
interdisciplinary domains. In addition to patent analysis, the platform
integrates commercial intelligence by identifying validated market solutions
and active organizations addressing similar challenges. This combined insight
sourced from both intellectual property and real world product data enables R&D
teams to assess not only technical novelty but also feasibility, scalability,
and sustainability. The result is a comprehensive, AI driven scouting engine

### [197] [The Blessing and Curse of Dimensionality in Safety Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20333)
*Rachel S. Y. Teo,Laziz U. Abdullaev,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: High-dimensional representations in LLMs can be exploited for safety alignment circumvention, but dimensional reduction mitigates this issue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how high-dimensional representations in LLMs may lead to safety alignment vulnerabilities and propose solutions.

Method: Visualize linear subspaces, project representations to lower dimensions, and empirically test susceptibility to jailbreaking.

Result: Dimensional reduction reduces jailbreaking susceptibility while preserving alignment information.

Conclusion: High dimensions in LLMs are both beneficial and problematic for safety alignment; dimensional reduction offers a balance.

Abstract: The focus on safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) has increased
significantly due to their widespread adoption across different domains. The
scale of LLMs play a contributing role in their success, and the growth in
parameter count follows larger hidden dimensions. In this paper, we hypothesize
that while the increase in dimensions has been a key advantage, it may lead to
emergent problems as well. These problems emerge as the linear structures in
the activation space can be exploited, in the form of activation engineering,
to circumvent its safety alignment. Through detailed visualizations of linear
subspaces associated with different concepts, such as safety, across various
model scales, we show that the curse of high-dimensional representations
uniquely impacts LLMs. Further substantiating our claim, we demonstrate that
projecting the representations of the model onto a lower dimensional subspace
can preserve sufficient information for alignment while avoiding those linear
structures. Empirical results confirm that such dimensional reduction
significantly reduces susceptibility to jailbreaking through representation
engineering. Building on our empirical validations, we provide theoretical
insights into these linear jailbreaking methods relative to a model's hidden
dimensions. Broadly speaking, our work posits that the high dimensions of a
model's internal representations can be both a blessing and a curse in safety
alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack visual context crucial for robust decision-making in complex driving environments, prompting the need for a hybrid framework combining VLMs and real-time planners.

Method: VLMPlanner uses a VLM to process multi-view images for detailed visual reasoning and introduces the CAI-Gate mechanism to dynamically adjust inference frequency based on scene complexity.

Result: The approach outperforms on the nuPlan benchmark, excelling in scenarios with intricate road conditions and dynamic elements.

Conclusion: VLMPlanner offers a robust, efficient solution for autonomous driving motion planning by integrating VLMs and adaptive inference, enhancing performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into autonomous driving motion
planning has recently emerged as a promising direction, offering enhanced
interpretability, better controllability, and improved generalization in rare
and long-tail scenarios. However, existing methods often rely on abstracted
perception or map-based inputs, missing crucial visual context, such as
fine-grained road cues, accident aftermath, or unexpected obstacles, which are
essential for robust decision-making in complex driving environments. To bridge
this gap, we propose VLMPlanner, a hybrid framework that combines a
learning-based real-time planner with a vision-language model (VLM) capable of
reasoning over raw images. The VLM processes multi-view images to capture rich,
detailed visual information and leverages its common-sense reasoning
capabilities to guide the real-time planner in generating robust and safe
trajectories. Furthermore, we develop the Context-Adaptive Inference Gate
(CAI-Gate) mechanism that enables the VLM to mimic human driving behavior by
dynamically adjusting its inference frequency based on scene complexity,
thereby achieving an optimal balance between planning performance and
computational efficiency. We evaluate our approach on the large-scale,
challenging nuPlan benchmark, with comprehensive experimental results
demonstrating superior planning performance in scenarios with intricate road
conditions and dynamic elements. Code will be available.

*Farshid Nooshi,Suining He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HAG-PS is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning method for dynamic mobility resource allocation, addressing policy sharing and memory efficiency in urban-scale settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rebalance mobility demand and supply by dynamically allocating resources like shared bikes/e-scooters and ride-sharing vehicles.

Method: Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS) with global/local information, adaptive agent grouping, and learnable ID embeddings.

Result: Superior performance in bike availability using NYC bike-sharing data (1.2M+ trips).

Conclusion: HAG-PS effectively addresses mobility resource allocation challenges with adaptive and memory-efficient solutions.

Abstract: Allocating mobility resources (e.g., shared bikes/e-scooters, ride-sharing
vehicles) is crucial for rebalancing the mobility demand and supply in the
urban environments. We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement
learning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)
for dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important
research challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility
resource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility
resource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across
agents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);
and (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale
setting. To address the above challenges, we have provided following novel
designs within HAG-PS. To enable dynamic and adaptive parameter sharing, we
have designed a hierarchical approach that consists of global and local
information of the mobility resource states (e.g., distribution of mobility
resources). We have developed an adaptive agent grouping approach in order to
split or merge the groups of agents based on their relative closeness of
encoded trajectories (i.e., states, actions, and rewards). We have designed a
learnable identity (ID) embeddings to enable agent specialization beyond simple
parameter copy. We have performed extensive experimental studies based on
real-world NYC bike sharing data (a total of more than 1.2 million trips), and
demonstrated the superior performance (e.g., improved bike availability) of
HAG-PS compared with other baseline approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MazeEval, a benchmark to evaluate spatial reasoning in LLMs using coordinate-based maze navigation tasks, revealing performance disparities and cross-linguistic limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' spatial reasoning without visual cues, crucial for autonomous agents in robotics and embodied AI, as current research lacks such evaluations.

Method: Uses a function-calling interface for maze navigation (5x5 to 15x15 grids) with coordinate feedback and distance-to-wall data, excluding visual input. Evaluates eight LLMs in English and Icelandic.

Result: Performance varies widely: OpenAI's O3 excels (perfect navigation up to 30x30 mazes), while others fail beyond 9x9 mazes due to looping. Icelandic performance drops by 3-4 maze sizes, indicating linguistic dependency.

Conclusion: Spatial reasoning in LLMs is linguistically constrained, highlighting the need for architectural improvements for reliable global deployment.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly power autonomous agents in
robotics and embodied AI, understanding their spatial reasoning capabilities
becomes crucial for ensuring reliable real-world deployment. Despite advances
in language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs
perform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for
agents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this
gap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure
spatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our
methodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of
varying complexity ($5\times 5$ to $15\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate
feedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test
fundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
identical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic
transfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while
OpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\times 30$,
other models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\times 9$ mazes, with 100%
of failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a
cell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in
Icelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,
suggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather
than language-agnostic mechanisms. These results have important implications
for global deployment of LLM-powered autonomous systems, showing spatial
intelligence remains fundamentally constrained by training data availability
and highlighting the need for architectural innovations to achieve reliable
navigation across linguistic contexts.

Abstract: In the context of the rapidly evolving information technology landscape,
marked by the advent of 6G communication networks, we face an increased data
volume and complexity in network environments. This paper addresses these
challenges by focusing on Quality of Service (QoS) in edge computing
frameworks. We propose a novel approach to enhance QoS through the development
of General Artificial Intelligence Lifelong Learning Systems, with a special
emphasis on Federated Layering Techniques (FLT). Our work introduces a
federated layering-based small model collaborative mechanism aimed at improving
AI models' operational efficiency and response time in environments where
resources are limited. This innovative method leverages the strengths of cloud
and edge computing, incorporating a negotiation and debate mechanism among
small AI models to enhance reasoning and decision-making processes. By
integrating model layering techniques with privacy protection measures, our
approach ensures the secure transmission of model parameters while maintaining
high efficiency in learning and reasoning capabilities. The experimental
results demonstrate that our strategy not only enhances learning efficiency and
reasoning accuracy but also effectively protects the privacy of edge nodes.
This presents a viable solution for achieving resilient large model lifelong
learning systems, with a significant improvement in QoS for edge computing
environments.

Motivation: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is crucial for road safety and emergency response, but existing methods fail to capture intricate variable interdependencies.

Method: STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal traffic patterns, and environmental context using adaptive graph construction and modality-aware attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves Macro F1-score of 85%, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and recall of 81% on FARS dataset; generalizes well on ARI-BUET dataset with similar metrics.

Conclusion: STARN-GAT effectively bridges advanced graph neural networks with practical road safety applications, offering interpretability and real-time potential.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic accident severity is critical for improving
road safety, optimizing emergency response strategies, and informing the design
of safer transportation infrastructure. However, existing approaches often
struggle to effectively model the intricate interdependencies among spatial,
temporal, and contextual variables that govern accident outcomes. In this
study, we introduce STARN-GAT, a Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention
Network, which leverages adaptive graph construction and modality-aware
attention mechanisms to capture these complex relationships. Unlike
conventional methods, STARN-GAT integrates road network topology, temporal
traffic patterns, and environmental context within a unified attention-based
framework. The model is evaluated on the Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS) dataset, achieving a Macro F1-score of 85 percent, ROC-AUC of 0.91, and
recall of 81 percent for severe incidents. To ensure generalizability within
the South Asian context, STARN-GAT is further validated on the ARI-BUET traffic
accident dataset, where it attains a Macro F1-score of 0.84, recall of 0.78,
and ROC-AUC of 0.89. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
identifying high-risk cases and its potential for deployment in real-time,
safety-critical traffic management systems. Furthermore, the attention-based
architecture enhances interpretability, offering insights into contributing
factors and supporting trust in AI-assisted decision-making. Overall, STARN-GAT
bridges the gap between advanced graph neural network techniques and practical
applications in road safety analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the trustworthiness of AI agents in real-world deployments, especially under adversarial attacks, and identify vulnerabilities.

Method: Conducted a public red-teaming competition involving 22 AI agents across 44 scenarios, collecting 1.8 million prompt-injection attacks. Analyzed results to create the ART benchmark.

Result: Over 60,000 attacks succeeded in violating policies, with high transferability across models. No strong correlation found between robustness and model size or capability.

Conclusion: AI agents have critical vulnerabilities; the ART benchmark aims to improve security assessments and safer deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances have enabled LLM-powered AI agents to autonomously execute
complex tasks by combining language model reasoning with tools, memory, and web
access. But can these systems be trusted to follow deployment policies in
realistic environments, especially under attack? To investigate, we ran the
largest public red-teaming competition to date, targeting 22 frontier AI agents
across 44 realistic deployment scenarios. Participants submitted 1.8 million
prompt-injection attacks, with over 60,000 successfully eliciting policy
violations such as unauthorized data access, illicit financial actions, and
regulatory noncompliance. We use these results to build the Agent Red Teaming
(ART) benchmark - a curated set of high-impact attacks - and evaluate it across
19 state-of-the-art models. Nearly all agents exhibit policy violations for
most behaviors within 10-100 queries, with high attack transferability across
models and tasks. Importantly, we find limited correlation between agent
robustness and model size, capability, or inference-time compute, suggesting
that additional defenses are needed against adversarial misuse. Our findings
highlight critical and persistent vulnerabilities in today's AI agents. By
releasing the ART benchmark and accompanying evaluation framework, we aim to
support more rigorous security assessment and drive progress toward safer agent
deployment.

TL;DR: MeLA introduces a metacognitive LLM-driven architecture for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD), evolving prompts instead of heuristic code, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evolutionary methods directly modify heuristic code, which can be limiting. MeLA aims to improve heuristic design by leveraging LLMs and metacognitive feedback.

Method: MeLA uses prompt evolution guided by a metacognitive framework, integrating a problem analyzer, error diagnosis system, and metacognitive search engine to refine prompts iteratively.

Result: MeLA generates more effective and robust heuristics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in benchmark and real-world problems.

Conclusion: The research highlights the potential of cognitive science-inspired AI architectures, showing that metacognitive regulation in LLMs leads to better AHD outcomes.

Abstract: This paper introduces MeLA, a Metacognitive LLM-Driven Architecture that
presents a new paradigm for Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD). Traditional
evolutionary methods operate directly on heuristic code; in contrast, MeLA
evolves the instructional prompts used to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) in
generating these heuristics. This process of "prompt evolution" is driven by a
novel metacognitive framework where the system analyzes performance feedback to
systematically refine its generative strategy. MeLA's architecture integrates a
problem analyzer to construct an initial strategic prompt, an error diagnosis
system to repair faulty code, and a metacognitive search engine that
iteratively optimizes the prompt based on heuristic effectiveness. In
comprehensive experiments across both benchmark and real-world problems, MeLA
consistently generates more effective and robust heuristics, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ultimately, this research demonstrates
the profound potential of using cognitive science as a blueprint for AI
architecture, revealing that by enabling an LLM to metacognitively regulate its
problem-solving process, we unlock a more robust and interpretable path to AHD.

*Jiajun Liu,Wenjun Ke,Peng Wang,Yao He,Ziyu Shang,Guozheng Li,Zijie Xu,Ke Ji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphDPO is a novel approximate unlearning framework for knowledge graphs that addresses incomplete forgetting and boundary knowledge preservation by reframing unlearning as a preference optimization problem and introducing out-boundary sampling and boundary recall mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning methods for knowledge graphs either require high training costs (exact unlearning) or fail to fully remove targeted information and weaken boundary knowledge (approximate unlearning).

Method: GraphDPO uses direct preference optimization (DPO) to reframe unlearning as a preference problem, penalizing forgettable knowledge. It includes out-boundary sampling and boundary recall mechanisms to preserve knowledge integrity.

Result: GraphDPO outperforms baselines by up to 10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1 across eight datasets.

Conclusion: GraphDPO effectively removes targeted knowledge while preserving the integrity of remaining knowledge in KGs, offering a superior solution to existing unlearning methods.

Abstract: Existing knowledge graphs (KGs) inevitably contain outdated or erroneous
knowledge that needs to be removed from knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models.
To address this challenge, knowledge unlearning can be applied to eliminate
specific information while preserving the integrity of the remaining knowledge
in KGs. Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact
unlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high
training costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to
KGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove
targeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from
remaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which
weakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these
issues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on
direct preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting
triples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the
model is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original
forgetting triples. This formulation penalizes reliance on forgettable
knowledge, mitigating incomplete forgetting caused by KG connectivity.
Moreover, we introduce an out-boundary sampling strategy to construct
preference pairs with minimal semantic overlap, weakening the connection
between forgetting and retained knowledge. Secondly, to preserve boundary
knowledge, we introduce a boundary recall mechanism that replays and distills
relevant information both within and across time steps. We construct eight
unlearning datasets across four popular KGs with varying unlearning rates.
Experiments show that GraphDPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to
10.1% in MRR_Avg and 14.0% in MRR_F1.

*Te Zhang,Yuheng Li,Junxiang Wang,Lujun Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive search algorithm for compressing large multimodal models (LMMs) by optimizing sparsity and KV cache compression, achieving efficiency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressing LMMs for edge device deployment is challenging; existing methods lack efficiency or compromise accuracy.

Method: Uses Tree-structured Parzen Estimator to dynamically adjust pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth, combining pruning with KV cache quantization without fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms SparseGPT and Wanda on benchmarks like LLaVA-1.5 7B/13B, achieving memory efficiency with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework sets a new standard in LMM optimization by efficiently balancing compression and performance.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have advanced significantly by integrating
visual encoders with extensive language models, enabling robust reasoning
capabilities. However, compressing LMMs for deployment on edge devices remains
a critical challenge. In this work, we propose an adaptive search algorithm
that optimizes sparsity and KV cache compression to enhance LMM efficiency.
Utilizing the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator, our method dynamically adjusts
pruning ratios and KV cache quantization bandwidth across different LMM layers,
using model performance as the optimization objective. This approach uniquely
combines pruning with key-value cache quantization and incorporates a fast
pruning technique that eliminates the need for additional fine-tuning or weight
adjustments, achieving efficient compression without compromising accuracy.
Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including LLaVA-1.5 7B and
13B, demonstrate our method superiority over state-of-the-art techniques such
as SparseGPT and Wanda across various compression levels. Notably, our
framework automatic allocation of KV cache compression resources sets a new
standard in LMM optimization, delivering memory efficiency without sacrificing
much performance.

*Lijian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoCME improves MMKGC by leveraging intra- and inter-modal complementarity and dynamic negative sampling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the imbalance and overlooked complementarity in multimodal knowledge graphs for better entity representation.

Method: Proposes MoCME with CMKF for modality fusion and EGNS for dynamic negative sampling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MoCME effectively enhances entity representation and model robustness in MMKGC.

Abstract: Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Completion (MMKGC) aims to uncover hidden world
knowledge in multimodal knowledge graphs by leveraging both multimodal and
structural entity information. However, the inherent imbalance in multimodal
knowledge graphs, where modality distributions vary across entities, poses
challenges in utilizing additional modality data for robust entity
representation. Existing MMKGC methods typically rely on attention or
gate-based fusion mechanisms but overlook complementarity contained in
multi-modal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named Mixture of
Complementary Modality Experts (MoCME), which consists of a
Complementarity-guided Modality Knowledge Fusion (CMKF) module and an
Entropy-guided Negative Sampling (EGNS) mechanism. The CMKF module exploits
both intra-modal and inter-modal complementarity to fuse multi-view and
multi-modal embeddings, enhancing representations of entities. Additionally, we
introduce an Entropy-guided Negative Sampling mechanism to dynamically
prioritize informative and uncertain negative samples to enhance training
effectiveness and model robustness. Extensive experiments on five benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our MoCME achieves state-of-the-art performance,
surpassing existing approaches.

### [208] [Adaptive Fuzzy Time Series Forecasting via Partially Asymmetric Convolution and Sub-Sliding Window Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20641)
*Lijian Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel convolutional architecture with adaptive fuzzified temporal data and partially asymmetric design improves spatio-temporal dependency capture and global information synthesis for time series forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing forecasting models lack the ability to effectively capture spatio-temporal dependencies and synthesize global information during learning.

Method: The paper introduces an improved fuzzy time series construction strategy, a bilateral Atrous algorithm for reduced computation, and a partially asymmetric convolutional architecture for flexible feature mining.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular time series datasets.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the limitations of current models by enhancing temporal interrelation extraction and computational efficiency.

Abstract: At present, state-of-the-art forecasting models are short of the ability to
capture spatio-temporal dependency and synthesize global information at the
stage of learning. To address this issue, in this paper, through the adaptive
fuzzified construction of temporal data, we propose a novel convolutional
architecture with partially asymmetric design based on the scheme of sliding
window to realize accurate time series forecasting. First, the construction
strategy of traditional fuzzy time series is improved to further extract short
and long term temporal interrelation, which enables every time node to
automatically possess corresponding global information and inner relationships
among them in a restricted sliding window and the process does not require
human involvement. Second, a bilateral Atrous algorithm is devised to reduce
calculation demand of the proposed model without sacrificing global
characteristics of elements. And it also allows the model to avoid processing
redundant information. Third, after the transformation of time series, a
partially asymmetric convolutional architecture is designed to more flexibly
mine data features by filters in different directions on feature maps, which
gives the convolutional neural network (CNN) the ability to construct
sub-windows within existing sliding windows to model at a more fine-grained
level. And after obtaining the time series information at different levels, the
multi-scale features from different sub-windows will be sent to the
corresponding network layer for time series information fusion. Compared with
other competitive modern models, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
results on most of popular time series datasets, which is fully verified by the
experimental results.

### [209] [A General Framework for Dynamic MAPF using Multi-Shot ASP and Tunnels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20703)
*Aysu Bogatarkan,Esra Erdem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic MAPF (D-MAPF), a variant of the MAPF problem, addressing dynamic changes like agent/obstacle movements. It proposes a general definition, a flexible framework, and an ASP-based method with 'tunnels' for efficient replanning. Experimental results evaluate performance and solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study is motivated by real-world warehouse applications where dynamic changes (e.g., agents entering/leaving, obstacles moving) require adaptable solutions for collision-free multi-agent pathfinding.

Method: The paper presents 1) a general D-MAPF definition, 2) a multi-shot computation framework, and 3) an ASP-based method using 'tunnels' to combine replanning and repairing strategies.

Result: Experimental evaluations highlight the method's computational performance and solution quality, showcasing its strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: The proposed D-MAPF framework and ASP-based method offer a practical approach for dynamic environments, balancing adaptability and efficiency.

Abstract: MAPF problem aims to find plans for multiple agents in an environment within
a given time, such that the agents do not collide with each other or obstacles.
Motivated by the execution and monitoring of these plans, we study Dynamic MAPF
(D-MAPF) problem, which allows changes such as agents entering/leaving the
environment or obstacles being removed/moved. Considering the requirements of
real-world applications in warehouses with the presence of humans, we introduce
1) a general definition for D-MAPF (applicable to variations of D-MAPF), 2) a
new framework to solve D-MAPF (utilizing multi-shot computation, and allowing
different methods to solve D-MAPF), and 3) a new ASP-based method to solve
D-MAPF (combining advantages of replanning and repairing methods, with a novel
concept of tunnels to specify where agents can move). We have illustrated the
strengths and weaknesses of this method by experimental evaluations, from the
perspectives of computational performance and quality of solutions.

*Filip Cano,Thomas A. Henzinger,Konstantin Kueffner*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for analyzing fairness in AI as a runtime property, using a coin-toss model to study monitoring and enforcement strategies under evolving biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fairness studies treat fairness as static, but real-world AI systems evolve over time, requiring dynamic fairness analysis.

Method: A minimal model based on sequences of coin tosses with evolving biases is used to explore monitoring and enforcing fairness under various conditions.

Result: The paper provides a summary of strategies for monitoring and enforcing fairness, parametrized by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence thresholds.

Conclusion: The framework addresses the need for dynamic fairness analysis, offering insights into monitoring and enforcement under evolving conditions.

Abstract: Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.

### [211] [Learning the Value Systems of Societies from Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20728)
*Andrés Holgado-Sánchez,Holger Billhardt,Sascha Ossowski,Sara Degli-Esposti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for learning societal value systems using heuristic deep clustering, addressing the challenge of aligning AI with diverse human values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning AI with human values is crucial for ethical AI, but manually eliciting and calibrating value systems is difficult. Societal value systems are better represented as diverse group value systems rather than aggregated individual ones.

Method: The method uses heuristic deep clustering to learn socially shared value groundings and diverse value systems from qualitative preferences of sampled agents.

Result: The method is evaluated in a real-world use case involving traveling decisions, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully formalizes and addresses the problem of learning societal value systems, contributing to ethical AI development.

Abstract: Aligning AI systems with human values and the value-based preferences of
various stakeholders (their value systems) is key in ethical AI. In value-aware
AI systems, decision-making draws upon explicit computational representations
of individual values (groundings) and their aggregation into value systems. As
these are notoriously difficult to elicit and calibrate manually, value
learning approaches aim to automatically derive computational models of an
agent's values and value system from demonstrations of human behaviour.
Nonetheless, social science and humanities literature suggest that it is more
adequate to conceive the value system of a society as a set of value systems of
different groups, rather than as the simple aggregation of individual value
systems. Accordingly, here we formalize the problem of learning the value
systems of societies and propose a method to address it based on heuristic deep
clustering. The method learns socially shared value groundings and a set of
diverse value systems representing a given society by observing qualitative
value-based preferences from a sample of agents. We evaluate the proposal in a
use case with real data about travelling decisions.

*Arpan Dasgupta,Sarvesh Gharat,Neha Madhiwalla,Aparna Hegde,Milind Tambe,Aparna Taneja*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-targeted voice calls improve listenership and health behaviors in maternal and child health programs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement in health information programs, and assess if AI interventions lead to better health behaviors.

Method: Used an AI model (restless bandit) to target beneficiaries for live service calls, then measured listenership and health behavior changes.

Result: AI interventions improved listenership and led to significant health behavior improvements, like taking supplements and understanding health topics.

Conclusion: AI can effectively enhance maternal and child health outcomes by boosting engagement and knowledge.

Abstract: Automated voice calls with health information are a proven method for
disseminating maternal and child health information among beneficiaries and are
deployed in several programs around the world. However, these programs often
suffer from beneficiary dropoffs and poor engagement. In previous work, through
real-world trials, we showed that an AI model, specifically a restless bandit
model, could identify beneficiaries who would benefit most from live service
call interventions, preventing dropoffs and boosting engagement. However, one
key question has remained open so far: does such improved listenership via
AI-targeted interventions translate into beneficiaries' improved knowledge and
health behaviors? We present a first study that shows not only listenership
improvements due to AI interventions, but also simultaneously links these
improvements to health behavior changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that
AI-scheduled interventions, which enhance listenership, lead to statistically
significant improvements in beneficiaries' health behaviors such as taking iron
or calcium supplements in the postnatal period, as well as understanding of
critical health topics during pregnancy and infancy. This underscores the
potential of AI to drive meaningful improvements in maternal and child health.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the internal mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, revealing its role as a decoding space pruner and its task-dependent modulation of neuron engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the operational principles of CoT prompting, which enhances model reasoning but lacks mechanistic clarity.

Method: Reverse tracing of information flow across decoding, projection, and activation phases, with quantitative analysis of CoT's effects.

Result: CoT acts as a decoding space pruner guided by answer templates, with task-dependent neuron engagement (reduced in open-domain, increased in closed-domain tasks).

Conclusion: The findings provide a mechanistic interpretability framework and insights for designing targeted CoT interventions to improve prompt efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly enhances model reasoning, yet
its internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. We analyze CoT's operational
principles by reversely tracing information flow across decoding, projection,
and activation phases. Our quantitative analysis suggests that CoT may serve as
a decoding space pruner, leveraging answer templates to guide output
generation, with higher template adherence strongly correlating with improved
performance. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that CoT modulates neuron
engagement in a task-dependent manner: reducing neuron activation in
open-domain tasks, yet increasing it in closed-domain scenarios. These findings
offer a novel mechanistic interpretability framework and critical insights for
enabling targeted CoT interventions to design more efficient and robust
prompts. We released our code and data at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces evalSmarT, a framework using LLMs to evaluate smart contract comment quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics and human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating smart contract comments (BLEU, ROUGE, human evaluation) are either inadequate or impractical, necessitating a scalable, domain-aware solution.

Method: Developed evalSmarT, a modular framework combining ~40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies for 400+ evaluator configurations.

Result: Prompt design affects alignment with human judgment; LLM-based evaluation is scalable and semantically rich.

Conclusion: evalSmarT provides a scalable, effective alternative for evaluating smart contract comments, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Smart contract comment generation has gained traction as a means to improve
code comprehension and maintainability in blockchain systems. However,
evaluating the quality of generated comments remains a challenge. Traditional
metrics such as BLEU and ROUGE fail to capture domain-specific nuances, while
human evaluation is costly and unscalable. In this paper, we present
\texttt{evalSmarT}, a modular and extensible framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) as evaluators. The system supports over 400 evaluator
configurations by combining approximately 40 LLMs with 10 prompting strategies.
We demonstrate its application in benchmarking comment generation tools and
selecting the most informative outputs. Our results show that prompt design
significantly impacts alignment with human judgment, and that LLM-based
evaluation offers a scalable and semantically rich alternative to existing
methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMGraphRAG improves multimodal retrieval-augmented generation by using scene graphs and knowledge graphs to enhance reasoning and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG lacks multimodal integration and structured knowledge, while existing multimodal RAG methods miss logical chains and require task-specific training.

Method: MMGraphRAG refines visual content with scene graphs, builds a multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG), uses spectral clustering for cross-modal linking, and retrieves reasoning paths for generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DocBench and MMLongBench, showing strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning.

Conclusion: MMGraphRAG effectively addresses multimodal and structured knowledge limitations in RAG, improving performance and generalization.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language model generation by
retrieving relevant information from external knowledge bases. However,
conventional RAG methods face the issue of missing multimodal information.
Multimodal RAG methods address this by fusing images and text through mapping
them into a shared embedding space, but they fail to capture the structure of
knowledge and logical chains between modalities. Moreover, they also require
large-scale training for specific tasks, resulting in limited generalizing
ability. To address these limitations, we propose MMGraphRAG, which refines
visual content through scene graphs and constructs a multimodal knowledge graph
(MMKG) in conjunction with text-based KG. It employs spectral clustering to
achieve cross-modal entity linking and retrieves context along reasoning paths
to guide the generative process. Experimental results show that MMGraphRAG
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DocBench and MMLongBench datasets,
demonstrating strong domain adaptability and clear reasoning paths.

*Yang You,Vincent Thomas,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes,Olivier Buffet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: POMCGS is a new offline algorithm for solving large POMDPs, reducing computation by folding search trees into policy graphs, and handling continuous POMDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline policies are needed for POMDPs with time/energy constraints, but existing methods don't scale.

Method: POMCGS folds search trees into policy graphs, uses action progressive widening, and observation clustering.

Result: POMCGS solves previously intractable POMDPs, with competitive performance vs. online methods.

Conclusion: POMCGS is a scalable offline solution for large POMDPs, including continuous cases.

Abstract: Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.

*Bill Cochran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a model linking neural network depth to logical reasoning limits, showing each layer adds only one logical level. It explains phenomena like hallucination and suggests future architectural improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and formalize the reasoning limitations of large neural language models based on their architectural depth.

Method: Treats neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space, analyzing how each layer's depth limits logical expressiveness.

Result: Proves neural networks cannot represent higher-order logic predicates, explaining phenomena like hallucination and repetition.

Conclusion: The findings motivate future work on architectural extensions and interpretability strategies for language models.

Abstract: We propose a formal model of reasoning limitations in large neural net models
for language, grounded in the depth of their neural architecture. By treating
neural networks as linear operators over logic predicate space we show that
each layer can encode at most one additional level of logical reasoning. We
prove that a neural network of depth a particular depth cannot faithfully
represent predicates in a one higher order logic, such as simple counting over
complex predicates, implying a strict upper bound on logical expressiveness.
This structure induces a nontrivial null space during tokenization and
embedding, excluding higher-order predicates from representability. Our
framework offers a natural explanation for phenomena such as hallucination,
repetition, and limited planning, while also providing a foundation for
understanding how approximations to higher-order logic may emerge. These
results motivate architectural extensions and interpretability strategies in
future development of language models.

### [218] [Core Safety Values for Provably Corrigible Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20964)
*Aran Nayebi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for corrigibility in AI with provable guarantees, using five utility heads combined lexicographically, ensuring safety and human benefit even with learned errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring AI systems remain corrigible (safe and controllable) in complex, partially observed environments, avoiding hidden incentive conflicts.

Method: Replaces a single reward with five utility heads (deference, switch-access, truthfulness, low-impact, bounded task reward) combined lexicographically. Theorems prove corrigibility guarantees even with learned errors.

Result: Exact corrigibility in single-round and multi-step settings, with bounded safety violations. Undecidability of post-hack safety is proven, but a decidable subset is identified for certification.

Conclusion: The framework provides clearer implementation guidance for AI safety, shifting risks to evaluation quality rather than hidden incentives, applicable to current and future systems.

Abstract: We introduce the first implementable framework for corrigibility, with
provable guarantees in multi-step, partially observed environments. Our
framework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*
utility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,
low-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility
Preservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict
weight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially
observable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,
self-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \emph{learned} to
mean-squared error $\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,
the probability of violating \emph{any} safety property is bounded while still
ensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,
which merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience
and impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended
settings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether
an arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by
reduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable
island'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and
verified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.
Consequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage
and generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality
rather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation
guidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.

TL;DR: MIRAGE-Bench is a unified benchmark for evaluating hallucinations in LLM-based agents, introducing a taxonomy and scalable evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmented evaluations and lack of principled testbeds for hallucinations in LLM-agent interactions.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy, systematic audit of benchmarks, and a snapshot strategy for test cases. Uses LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluation.

Result: Provides actionable insights on LLM agent failures and scalable assessment of hallucinations.

Conclusion: Lays groundwork for mitigating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent environments.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose critical risks for large language model (LLM)-based
agents, often manifesting as hallucinative actions resulting from fabricated or
misinterpreted information within the cognitive context. While recent studies
have exposed such failures, existing evaluations remain fragmented and lack a
principled testbed. In this paper, we present MIRAGE-Bench--Measuring Illusions
in Risky AGEnt settings--the first unified benchmark for eliciting and
evaluating hallucinations in interactive LLM-agent scenarios. We begin by
introducing a three-part taxonomy to address agentic hallucinations: actions
that are unfaithful to (i) task instructions, (ii) execution history, or (iii)
environment observations. To analyze, we first elicit such failures by
performing a systematic audit of existing agent benchmarks, then synthesize
test cases using a snapshot strategy that isolates decision points in
deterministic and reproducible manners. To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we
adopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware
prompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without
enumerating full action spaces. MIRAGE-Bench provides actionable insights on
failure modes of LLM agents and lays the groundwork for principled progress in
mitigating hallucinations in interactive environments.

TL;DR: The paper improves ASP-based interactive product configuration by enhancing performance with smart expansion functions and a user-friendly API.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in guiding users through large-scale industrial configuration problems using ASP.

Method: Enhances the incremental approach with four smart expansion functions, leveraging cautious and brave consequences to limit costly checks.

Result: Improved solving performance by reducing search space and unsatisfiability checks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively supports interactive configuration with a user interface implemented in ASP.

Abstract: Product configuration is a successful application of Answer Set Programming
(ASP). However, challenges are still open for interactive systems to
effectively guide users through the configuration process. The aim of our work
is to provide an ASP-based solver for interactive configuration that can deal
with large-scale industrial configuration problems and that supports intuitive
user interfaces via an API. In this paper, we focus on improving the
performance of automatically completing a partial configuration. Our main
contribution enhances the classical incremental approach for multi-shot solving
by four different smart expansion functions. The core idea is to determine and
add specific objects or associations to the partial configuration by exploiting
cautious and brave consequences before checking for the existence of a complete
configuration with the current objects in each iteration. This approach limits
the number of costly unsatisfiability checks and reduces the search space,
thereby improving solving performance. In addition, we present a user interface
that uses our API and is implemented in ASP.

Conclusion: GenoMAS successfully integrates reliability and adaptability, offering a robust solution for gene expression analysis and uncovering biologically plausible associations.

Abstract: Gene expression analysis holds the key to many biomedical discoveries, yet
extracting insights from raw transcriptomic data remains formidable due to the
complexity of multiple large, semi-structured files and the need for extensive
domain expertise. Current automation approaches are often limited by either
inflexible workflows that break down in edge cases or by fully autonomous
agents that lack the necessary precision for rigorous scientific inquiry.
GenoMAS charts a different course by presenting a team of LLM-based scientists
that integrates the reliability of structured workflows with the adaptability
of autonomous agents. GenoMAS orchestrates six specialized LLM agents through
typed message-passing protocols, each contributing complementary strengths to a
shared analytic canvas. At the heart of GenoMAS lies a guided-planning
framework: programming agents unfold high-level task guidelines into Action
Units and, at each juncture, elect to advance, revise, bypass, or backtrack,
thereby maintaining logical coherence while bending gracefully to the
idiosyncrasies of genomic data.
  On the GenoTEX benchmark, GenoMAS reaches a Composite Similarity Correlation
of 89.13% for data preprocessing and an F$_1$ of 60.48% for gene
identification, surpassing the best prior art by 10.61% and 16.85%
respectively. Beyond metrics, GenoMAS surfaces biologically plausible
gene-phenotype associations corroborated by the literature, all while adjusting
for latent confounders. Code is available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoMAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reviews self-evolving agents for LLMs, focusing on what, when, and how to evolve, covering mechanisms, methods, and applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are static and struggle with adaptation, necessitating self-evolving agents for dynamic environments.

Method: Systematic review of evolutionary mechanisms, adaptation methods, and designs for self-evolving agents.

Result: Provides a framework for designing adaptive agents, with applications in coding, education, and healthcare.

Conclusion: The survey outlines a roadmap for advancing self-evolving agents toward Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities but remain
fundamentally static, unable to adapt their internal parameters to novel tasks,
evolving knowledge domains, or dynamic interaction contexts. As LLMs are
increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, this static
nature has become a critical bottleneck, necessitating agents that can
adaptively reason, act, and evolve in real time. This paradigm shift -- from
scaling static models to developing self-evolving agents -- has sparked growing
interest in architectures and methods enabling continual learning and
adaptation from data, interactions, and experiences. This survey provides the
first systematic and comprehensive review of self-evolving agents, organized
around three foundational dimensions -- what to evolve, when to evolve, and how
to evolve. We examine evolutionary mechanisms across agent components (e.g.,
models, memory, tools, architecture), categorize adaptation methods by stages
(e.g., intra-test-time, inter-test-time), and analyze the algorithmic and
architectural designs that guide evolutionary adaptation (e.g., scalar rewards,
textual feedback, single-agent and multi-agent systems). Additionally, we
analyze evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored for self-evolving agents,
highlight applications in domains such as coding, education, and healthcare,
and identify critical challenges and research directions in safety,
scalability, and co-evolutionary dynamics. By providing a structured framework
for understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a
roadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world
deployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of
Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,
performing at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.

*Khalid Hasan,Jamil Saquer,Mukulika Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) and LSTM for mental health disorder classification on Reddit, showing transformers' superiority, especially RoBERTa, with high F1 scores. LSTM with BERT embeddings also performed well with lower computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for automated tools for early mental health disorder detection due to rising prevalence, leveraging NLP advancements.

Method: Comparative evaluation of transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, ELECTRA) and LSTM with text embeddings on a large annotated Reddit dataset, validated via statistical and topic modeling.

Result: Transformers outperformed LSTM; RoBERTa achieved 99.54% F1 (hold-out) and 96.05% (external). LSTM with BERT embeddings scored >94% F1 with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Transformer models are effective for scalable mental health monitoring, with RoBERTa leading. LSTM with BERT embeddings offers a resource-efficient alternative. Insights support clinical and digital mental health applications.

Abstract: The rising prevalence of mental health disorders necessitates the development
of robust, automated tools for early detection and monitoring. Recent advances
in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly transformer-based
architectures, have demonstrated significant potential in text analysis. This
study provides a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art transformer
models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and ELECTRA) against Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based approaches using different text embedding techniques for
mental health disorder classification on Reddit. We construct a large annotated
dataset, validating its reliability through statistical judgmental analysis and
topic modeling. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of
transformer models over traditional deep-learning approaches. RoBERTa achieved
the highest classification performance, with a 99.54% F1 score on the hold-out
test set and a 96.05% F1 score on the external test set. Notably, LSTM models
augmented with BERT embeddings proved highly competitive, achieving F1 scores
exceeding 94% on the external dataset while requiring significantly fewer
computational resources. These findings highlight the effectiveness of
transformer-based models for real-time, scalable mental health monitoring. We
discuss the implications for clinical applications and digital mental health
interventions, offering insights into the capabilities and limitations of
state-of-the-art NLP methodologies in mental disorder detection.

### [224] [Setting The Table with Intent: Intent-aware Schema Generation and Editing for Literature Review Tables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19521)
*Vishakh Padmakumar,Joseph Chee Chang,Kyle Lo,Doug Downey,Aakanksha Naik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in schema generation for organizing academic literature using LLMs, introducing a dataset with synthesized intents and editing techniques to improve schema quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to organize and compare academic documents efficiently, hindered by ambiguity in evaluations and lack of refinement methods.

Method: Augments unannotated table corpora with synthesized intents for dataset creation, benchmarks schema generation methods, and proposes LLM-based editing techniques.

Result: Incorporating table intents improves schema reconstruction; smaller fine-tuned models match prompted LLMs, and editing further enhances schema quality.

Conclusion: The work advances schema generation by addressing ambiguity and refining outputs, demonstrating competitive performance with smaller models.

Abstract: The increasing volume of academic literature makes it essential for
researchers to organize, compare, and contrast collections of documents. Large
language models (LLMs) can support this process by generating schemas defining
shared aspects along which to compare papers. However, progress on schema
generation has been slow due to: (i) ambiguity in reference-based evaluations,
and (ii) lack of editing/refinement methods. Our work is the first to address
both issues. First, we present an approach for augmenting unannotated table
corpora with synthesized intents and apply it to create a dataset for studying
schema generation conditioned on a given information need, thus reducing
ambiguity. With this dataset, we show how incorporating table intents
significantly improves baseline performance in reconstructing reference
schemas. Next, we propose several LLM-based schema editing techniques. We start
by comprehensively benchmarking several single-shot schema generation methods,
including prompted LLM workflows and fine-tuned models, showing that smaller,
open-weight models can be fine-tuned to be competitive with state-of-the-art
prompted LLMs. Then we demonstrate that our editing techniques can further
improve schemas generated by these methods.

enhance the accessibility, reuse, and cross-lingual interoperability of
thesauri by hurdle-free automated translation and improved ontology matching
performance, supporting more inclusive and multilingual research
infrastructures.

*Shengyuan Wang,Jie Feng,Tianhui Liu,Dan Pei,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses geospatial hallucinations in LLMs, proposes an evaluation framework, and introduces a method to mitigate these hallucinations, improving performance by 29.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to unreliable outputs. This gap in systematic evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations needs addressing.

Method: A comprehensive evaluation framework using structured geospatial knowledge graphs is proposed. A dynamic factuality aligning method based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is introduced to mitigate hallucinations.

Result: Evaluation across 20 advanced LLMs reveals geospatial hallucinations. The proposed method improves performance by 29.6% on the benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework and method effectively enhance LLM trustworthiness in geospatial tasks, as demonstrated by experimental results.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, including
geospatial knowledge, which has been successfully applied to various geospatial
tasks such as mobility prediction and social indicator prediction. However,
LLMs often generate inaccurate geospatial knowledge, leading to geospatial
hallucinations (incorrect or inconsistent representations of geospatial
information) that compromise their reliability. While the phenomenon of general
knowledge hallucination in LLMs has been widely studied, the systematic
evaluation and mitigation of geospatial hallucinations remain largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive evaluation
framework for geospatial hallucinations, leveraging structured geospatial
knowledge graphs for controlled assessment. Through extensive evaluation across
20 advanced LLMs, we uncover the hallucinations in their geospatial knowledge.
Building on these insights, we introduce a dynamic factuality aligning method
based on Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) to mitigate geospatial
hallucinations in LLMs, leading to a performance improvement of over 29.6% on
the proposed benchmark. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our benchmark and learning algorithm in enhancing the
trustworthiness of LLMs in geospatial knowledge and reasoning tasks.

*Yutao Sun,Zhenyu Li,Yike Zhang,Tengyu Pan,Bowen Dong,Yuyi Guo,Jianyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey on efficient attention mechanisms in Transformer-based models, addressing quadratic complexity issues in self-attention for long-context modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic time and memory complexity of self-attention in Transformers hinders efficient long-context modeling, prompting research into scalable solutions.

Method: Two approaches are explored: linear attention (kernel approximations, recurrent formulations) and sparse attention (fixed patterns, block-wise routing, clustering).

Result: The survey integrates algorithmic innovations and hardware considerations, analyzing their application in pre-trained language models.

Conclusion: This work serves as a foundational reference for designing scalable and efficient language models by aligning theory with practical deployment.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the prevailing backbone of large
language models. However, the quadratic time and memory complexity of
self-attention remains a fundamental obstacle to efficient long-context
modeling. To address this limitation, recent research has introduced two
principal categories of efficient attention mechanisms. Linear attention
methods achieve linear complexity through kernel approximations, recurrent
formulations, or fastweight dynamics, thereby enabling scalable inference with
reduced computational overhead. Sparse attention techniques, in contrast, limit
attention computation to selected subsets of tokens based on fixed patterns,
block-wise routing, or clustering strategies, enhancing efficiency while
preserving contextual coverage. This survey provides a systematic and
comprehensive overview of these developments, integrating both algorithmic
innovations and hardware-level considerations. In addition, we analyze the
incorporation of efficient attention into largescale pre-trained language
models, including both architectures built entirely on efficient attention and
hybrid designs that combine local and global components. By aligning
theoretical foundations with practical deployment strategies, this work aims to
serve as a foundational reference for advancing the design of scalable and
efficient language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces code decomposition attacks to exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs' code generation, proposes a benchmark for evaluation, and shows fine-tuning improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored robustness of LLMs against adversarial misuse via multi-turn malicious coding prompts.

Method: Introduces code decomposition attacks and a benchmark (\benchmarkname{}) for evaluating LLMs. Uses fine-tuning on MOCHA to enhance robustness.

Result: LLMs show persistent vulnerabilities, especially in multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning improves rejection rates by up to 32.4%.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning on MOCHA enhances LLM robustness against adversarial prompts without compromising coding ability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced their code generation capabilities. However, their robustness against
adversarial misuse, particularly through multi-turn malicious coding prompts,
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce code decomposition attacks,
where a malicious coding task is broken down into a series of seemingly benign
subtasks across multiple conversational turns to evade safety filters. To
facilitate systematic evaluation, we introduce \benchmarkname{}, a large-scale
benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of code LLMs against both
single-turn and multi-turn malicious prompts. Empirical results across open-
and closed-source models reveal persistent vulnerabilities, especially under
multi-turn scenarios. Fine-tuning on MOCHA improves rejection rates while
preserving coding ability, and importantly, enhances robustness on external
adversarial datasets with up to 32.4% increase in rejection rates without any
additional supervision.

*Xuchen Wei,Yangxin Wu,Yaoyin Zhang,Henglyu Liu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HITSZ's IWSLT 2025 submission proposes an end-to-end ST system combining Whisper ASR and Krutrim LLM for English-Indic translation, achieving notable BLEU scores. CoT method shows promise but faces consistency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing low-resource challenges in English-Indic speech-to-text translation by leveraging pre-trained models.

Method: Integration of Whisper ASR and Krutrim LLM in an end-to-end system, with exploration of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for quality improvement.

Result: Average BLEU scores of 28.88 (English-to-Indic) and 27.86 (Indic-to-English). CoT improved Tamil-to-English by 13.84 BLEU but had format adherence issues.

Conclusion: The proposed system is effective for low-resource ST, but CoT requires further refinement for consistent performance.

Abstract: This paper presents HITSZ's submission for the IWSLT 2025 Indic track,
focusing on speech-to-text translation (ST) for English-to-Indic and
Indic-to-English language pairs. To enhance translation quality in this
low-resource scenario, we propose an end-to-end system integrating the
pre-trained Whisper automated speech recognition (ASR) model with Krutrim, an
Indic-specialized large language model (LLM). Experimental results demonstrate
that our end-to-end system achieved average BLEU scores of $28.88$ for
English-to-Indic directions and $27.86$ for Indic-to-English directions.
Furthermore, we investigated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. While this
method showed potential for significant translation quality improvements on
successfully parsed outputs (e.g. a $13.84$ BLEU increase for
Tamil-to-English), we observed challenges in ensuring the model consistently
adheres to the required CoT output format.

*Sara Papi,Maike Züfle,Marco Gaido,Beatrice Savoldi,Danni Liu,Ioannis Douros,Luisa Bentivogli,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MCIF is a new multilingual, multimodal benchmark for evaluating large language models (MLLMs) across languages, modalities, and task complexity, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' multilingual and multimodal capabilities, often being limited to English, single modalities, or short contexts.

Method: MCIF is introduced as a human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks, covering speech, vision, and text across four languages (English, German, Italian, Chinese) for short- and long-form inputs.

Result: MCIF enables a thorough assessment of MLLMs' ability to follow instructions in crosslingual, multimodal settings.

Conclusion: MCIF aims to advance MLLM research by providing a comprehensive, open benchmark under a CC-BY 4.0 license.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have catalyzed the development of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that integrate text, speech, and vision within unified
frameworks. As MLLMs evolve from narrow, monolingual, task-specific systems to
general-purpose instruction-following models, a key frontier lies in evaluating
their multilingual and multimodal capabilities over both long and short
contexts. However, existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these
dimensions jointly: they are often limited to English, mostly focus on one
single modality at a time, rely on short-form contexts, or lack human
annotations -- hindering comprehensive assessment of model performance across
languages, modalities, and task complexity. To address these gaps, we introduce
MCIF (Multimodal Crosslingual Instruction Following), the first multilingual
human-annotated benchmark based on scientific talks that is designed to
evaluate instruction-following in crosslingual, multimodal settings over both
short- and long-form inputs. MCIF spans three core modalities -- speech,
vision, and text -- and four diverse languages (English, German, Italian, and
Chinese), enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' abilities to interpret
instructions across languages and combine them with multimodal contextual
information. MCIF is released under a CC-BY 4.0 license to encourage open
research and progress in MLLMs development.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs and VLMs for understanding Romanian driving law using a new dataset (RoD-TAL) and shows domain-specific fine-tuning improves performance, though visual reasoning remains a challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for AI tools in legal education, especially for under-resourced languages like Romanian, by assessing LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Introduce RoD-TAL dataset, use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), dense retrievers, and reasoning-optimized models for tasks like IR, QA, Visual IR, and Visual QA.

Result: Domain-specific fine-tuning boosts retrieval; chain-of-thought prompting improves QA accuracy, exceeding exam passing grades. Visual reasoning lags.

Conclusion: LLMs and VLMs show promise for legal education but face limitations in visual tasks, suggesting further research is needed.

Abstract: The intersection of AI and legal systems presents a growing need for tools
that support legal education, particularly in under-resourced languages such as
Romanian. In this work, we aim to evaluate the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding and reasoning
about Romanian driving law through textual and visual question-answering tasks.
To facilitate this, we introduce RoD-TAL, a novel multimodal dataset comprising
Romanian driving test questions, text-based and image-based, alongside
annotated legal references and human explanations. We implement and assess
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, dense retrievers, and
reasoning-optimized models across tasks including Information Retrieval (IR),
Question Answering (QA), Visual IR, and Visual QA. Our experiments demonstrate
that domain-specific fine-tuning significantly enhances retrieval performance.
At the same time, chain-of-thought prompting and specialized reasoning models
improve QA accuracy, surpassing the minimum grades required to pass driving
exams. However, visual reasoning remains challenging, highlighting the
potential and the limitations of applying LLMs and VLMs to legal education.

*Maitha Alshehhi,Ahmed Sharshar,Mohsen Guizani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Benchmarking multilingual and monolingual LLMs in low-resource languages reveals performance gaps, with multilingual models outperforming monolingual ones. Quantization maintains accuracy, but pruning harms performance, especially in larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM performance in low-resource languages like Kannada and Arabic and evaluate the impact of model compression techniques.

Method: Benchmarked multilingual and monolingual LLMs (e.g., BLOOMZ, AceGPT) across Arabic, English, and Indic languages, testing pruning and quantization effects.

Result: Multilingual models outperform monolingual ones. Quantization preserves accuracy, but pruning degrades performance, especially in larger models.

Conclusion: Multilingual models and careful compression (e.g., quantization) are key for scalable, fair NLP in low-resource settings, but pruning should be used cautiously.

Abstract: Although LLMs have attained significant success in high-resource languages,
their capacity in low-resource linguistic environments like Kannada and Arabic
is not yet fully understood. This work benchmarking the performance of
multilingual and monolingual Large Language Models (LLMs) across Arabic,
English, and Indic languages, with particular emphasis on the effects of model
compression strategies such as pruning and quantization. Findings shows
significant performance differences driven by linguistic diversity and resource
availability on SOTA LLMS as BLOOMZ, AceGPT, Jais, LLaMA-2, XGLM, and AraGPT2.
We find that multilingual versions of the model outperform their
language-specific counterparts across the board, indicating substantial
cross-lingual transfer benefits. Quantization (4-bit and 8-bit) is effective in
maintaining model accuracy while promoting efficiency, but aggressive pruning
significantly compromises performance, especially in bigger models. Our
findings pinpoint key strategies to construct scalable and fair multilingual
NLP solutions and underscore the need for interventions to address
hallucination and generalization errors in the low-resource setting.

*Ronak Upasham,Tathagata Dey,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pipeline for Table-to-Text (T2T) generation that combines objective and subjective text by leveraging intermediate RDF triples, outperforming some large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2T approaches lack subjectivity in text generation, focusing only on objective descriptions of tabular data.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: 1) RDF triple extraction, 2) text aggregation into narratives, and 3) subjectivity infusion using fine-tuned T5 models.

Result: The pipeline achieves performance comparable to GPT-3.5 and outperforms Mistral-7B and Llama-2, balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation.

Conclusion: This is the first structured pipeline for T2T generation integrating intermediate representations to enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

Abstract: In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on
providing objective descriptions of tabular data. However, generating text that
incorporates subjectivity, where subjectivity refers to interpretations beyond
raw numerical data, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce a
novel pipeline that leverages intermediate representations to generate both
objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity
to enrich the generated text. By incorporating RDFs, our approach enhances
factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama-2, our pipeline employs
smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5
and outperforming Mistral-7B and Llama-2 in several metrics. We evaluate our
approach through quantitative and qualitative analyses, demonstrating its
effectiveness in balancing factual accuracy with subjective interpretation. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose a structured
pipeline for T2T generation that integrates intermediate representations to
enhance both factual correctness and subjectivity.

*Zhi Zhou,Sirui Miao,Xiangyu Duan,Hao Yang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Basic Reading Distillation (BRD), a method to train small models by imitating LLMs' basic reading behaviors, improving performance on various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) require high computational resources, limiting real-world deployment. Existing distillation methods neglect generic text education for small models.

Method: Proposes BRD, training small models to imitate LLMs' basic reading behaviors (e.g., named entity recognition, Q&A) on generic texts before applying them to tasks.

Result: The small model outperforms or matches 20x larger LLMs on tasks like language inference and BIG-bench. BRD influences probability distribution and complements other distillation methods.

Conclusion: BRD effectively educates small models on generic texts, enhancing their performance and demonstrating orthogonality to other distillation techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
various natural language processing areas, but they demand high computation
resources which limits their deployment in real-world. Distillation is one
technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task
distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate
specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for
small models on generic texts that are \emph{unrelated} to downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small
model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity
recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic
education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language
inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can
outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that
BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and
has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation.

TL;DR: JT-Math-8B introduces a series of open-source models optimized for mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results among similar-sized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current LLMs in handling complex mathematical problems requiring deep understanding and multi-step reasoning.

Method: Uses a multi-stage optimization framework with a high-quality 210B-token dataset, SFT, GRPO-based RL, and a Long CoT approach for the Thinking Model.

Result: Surpasses models like OpenAI's O1-mini and GPT-4o, excelling in competition-level mathematics.

Conclusion: JT-Math-8B demonstrates superior performance in mathematical reasoning, setting a new benchmark for open-source models.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence
and a primary benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). While state-of-the-art models show promise, they often falter
when faced with complex problems that demand deep conceptual understanding and
intricate, multi-step deliberation. To address this challenge, we introduce
JT-Math-8B, a series of open-source models comprising base, instruct, and
thinking versions, built upon a systematic, multi-stage optimization framework.
Our pre-training corpus is a high-quality, 210B-token dataset curated through a
dedicated data pipeline that uses model-based validation to ensure quality and
diversity. The Instruct Model is optimized for direct, concise answers through
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a GRPO-based reinforcement learning (RL)
method. The Thinking Model is trained for complex problem-solving using a Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) approach, combining SFT with a novel, multi-stage
RL curriculum that progressively increases task difficulty and context length

### [236] [Are You There God? Lightweight Narrative Annotation of Christian Fiction with LMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19756)
*Rebecca M. M. Hicke,Brian Haggard,Mia Ferrante,Rayhan Khanna,David Mimno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses computational tools to analyze Christian Fiction, focusing on divine acts, revealing differences between the Left Behind series and broader Christian Fiction, as well as between male and female authors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Christian Fiction is understudied, with most attention on the Left Behind series. The paper aims to provide a broader understanding of the genre and its depiction of divine acts.

Method: Human annotators developed definitions for 'acts of God,' which were adapted for a lightweight language model (LM) with help from a larger model. The LM matched human annotations.

Result: Significant differences were found between the Left Behind series and other Christian Fiction, as well as between books by male and female authors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of lightweight LMs for nuanced tasks and provides insights into the diversity within Christian Fiction.

Abstract: In addition to its more widely studied political activities, the American
Evangelical movement has a well-developed but less externally visible cultural
and literary side. Christian Fiction, however, has been little studied, and
what scholarly attention there is has focused on the explosively popular Left
Behind series. In this work, we use computational tools to provide both a broad
topical overview of Christian Fiction as a genre and a more directed
exploration of how its authors depict divine acts. Working with human
annotators we first developed definitions and a codebook for "acts of God." We
then adapted those instructions designed for human annotators for use by a
recent, lightweight LM with the assistance of a much larger model. The
laptop-scale LM is capable of matching human annotations, even when the task is
subtle and challenging. Using these annotations, we show that significant and
meaningful differences exist between the Left Behind books and Christian
Fiction more broadly and between books by male and female authors.

*Dong Du,Shulin Liu,Tao Yang,Shaohua Chen,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement Learning (UloRL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning by segmenting ultra-long outputs and using dynamic masking, achieving significant performance and speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL frameworks struggle with inefficiencies in handling ultra-long outputs due to long-tail sequences and entropy collapse, limiting LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: Divides ultra-long output decoding into short segments for efficient training and introduces dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse.

Result: Achieved 2.06x training speed increase and improved performance on benchmarks (AIME2025: 70.9% to 85.1%, BeyondAIME: 50.7% to 61.9%), surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: UloRL effectively advances LLMs' reasoning with ultra-long sequences, demonstrating practical improvements and potential for broader application.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the
potential of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to enhance
reasoning capabilities through extended output sequences. However, traditional
RL frameworks face inefficiencies when handling ultra-long outputs due to
long-tail sequence distributions and entropy collapse during training. To
address these challenges, we propose an Ultra-Long Output Reinforcement
Learning (UloRL) approach for advancing large language models' reasoning
abilities. Specifically, we divide ultra long output decoding into short
segments, enabling efficient training by mitigating delays caused by long-tail
samples. Additionally, we introduce dynamic masking of well-Mastered Positive
Tokens (MPTs) to prevent entropy collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. On the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, RL with segment
rollout achieved 2.06x increase in training speed, while RL training with
128k-token outputs improves the model's performance on AIME2025 from 70.9\% to
85.1\% and on BeyondAIME from 50.7\% to 61.9\%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B
with remarkable gains. These findings underscore the potential of our methods
to advance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with ultra-long sequence
generation. We will release our code and model for further use by the
community.

*Tianxiang Chen,Zhentao Tan,Xiaofan Bo,Yue Wu,Tao Gong,Qi Chu,Jieping Ye,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flora is a human/LLM-free strategy to enhance long-context performance in LLMs by assembling short instructions, maintaining short-context abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in handling long contexts due to rarity, computational demands, and forgetting short-context abilities in LLMs.

Method: Flora constructs long contexts by assembling short instructions based on categories and using meta-instructions for responses.

Result: Improved long-context performance in benchmarks (Llama3-8B-Instruct, QwQ-32B) with minimal impact on short-context tasks.

Conclusion: Flora offers an efficient, scalable solution for long-context LLM enhancement without human/LLM intervention.

Abstract: Effectively handling long contexts is challenging for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to the rarity of long texts, high computational demands, and
substantial forgetting of short-context abilities. Recent approaches have
attempted to construct long contexts for instruction tuning, but these methods
often require LLMs or human interventions, which are both costly and limited in
length and diversity. Also, the drop in short-context performances of present
long-context LLMs remains significant. In this paper, we introduce Flora, an
effortless (human/LLM-free) long-context construction strategy. Flora can
markedly enhance the long-context performance of LLMs by arbitrarily assembling
short instructions based on categories and instructing LLMs to generate
responses based on long-context meta-instructions. This enables Flora to
produce contexts of arbitrary length and scale with rich diversity, while only
slightly compromising short-context performance. Experiments on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and QwQ-32B show that LLMs enhanced by Flora excel in three
long-context benchmarks while maintaining strong performances in short-context
tasks. Our data-construction code is available at

### [239] [HCAttention: Extreme KV Cache Compression via Heterogeneous Attention Computing for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19823)
*Dongquan Yang,Yifan Yang,Xiaotian Yu,Xianbiao Qi,Rong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HCAttention is a framework for efficient long-context inference in large language models by compressing the KV cache, reducing memory usage to 25% or even 12.5% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of high memory requirements for KV cache in long-context inference and the limitations of existing compression methods.

Method: HCAttention combines key quantization, value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction, requiring no model fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art KV cache compression, preserving accuracy with 25% memory and extending Llama-3-8B to process 4M tokens on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: HCAttention enables efficient long-context processing under extreme memory constraints, setting a new benchmark in KV cache compression.

Abstract: Processing long-context inputs with large language models presents a
significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the Key-Value
(KV) cache during inference. Existing KV cache compression methods exhibit
noticeable performance degradation when memory is reduced by more than 85%.
Additionally, strategies that leverage GPU-CPU collaboration for approximate
attention remain underexplored in this setting. We propose HCAttention, a
heterogeneous attention computation framework that integrates key quantization,
value offloading, and dynamic KV eviction to enable efficient inference under
extreme memory constraints. The method is compatible with existing transformer
architectures and does not require model fine-tuning. Experimental results on
the LongBench benchmark demonstrate that our approach preserves the accuracy of
full-attention model while shrinking the KV cache memory footprint to 25% of
its original size. Remarkably, it stays competitive with only 12.5% of the
cache, setting a new state-of-the-art in LLM KV cache compression. To the best
of our knowledge, HCAttention is the first to extend the Llama-3-8B model to
process 4 million tokens on a single A100 GPU with 80GB memory.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiscoDrive is a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn dialogs with disfluencies, improving conversational AI performance in in-car settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack spontaneous disfluencies common in real driver-AI dialogs, limiting AI robustness.

Method: A two-stage, prompt-driven pipeline dynamically integrates disfluencies during dialog synthesis.

Result: DiscoDrive outperforms KVRET-trained models on metrics like BLEU-4, METEOR, and BERTScore, and enhances low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: DiscoDrive effectively addresses the gap in datasets for disfluent in-car interactions, improving AI naturalness and coherence.

Abstract: In-car conversational AI is becoming increasingly critical as autonomous
vehicles and smart assistants gain widespread adoption. Yet, existing datasets
fail to capture the spontaneous disfluencies such as hesitations, false starts,
repetitions, and self-corrections that characterize real driver-AI dialogs. To
address this, we introduce DiscoDrive, a synthetic corpus of 3500 multi-turn
dialogs across seven automotive domains, generated using a two-stage,
prompt-driven pipeline that dynamically integrates disfluencies during
synthesis. We show that DiscoDrive is effective both as a training resource,
enabling DialoGPT-Medium and T5-Base to match or exceed KVRET-trained models on
the MultiWOZ 2.2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) relevant test sets (BLEU-4
improvements of 0.26 to 0.61; METEOR +2.10; ROUGE-L +3.48; BERTScore F1
improvements of 1.35 to 3.48), and as a data augmentation resource in
low-resource scenarios, delivering additional gains of up to BLEU-4 +0.38,
METEOR +1.95, ROUGE-L +2.87, and BERTScore F1 +4.00 when combined with 10
percent of KVRET. Human evaluations further confirm that dialogs sampled from
DiscoDrive are rated higher than KVRET's human-collected dialogs in naturalness
(3.8 vs 3.6) and coherence (4.1 vs 4.0), and are perceived as more
context-appropriate than leading post-hoc methods (such as LARD), without
compromising clarity. DiscoDrive fills a critical gap in existing resources and
serves as a versatile corpus for both training and augmenting conversational
AI, enabling robust handling of real-world, disfluent in-car interactions.

TL;DR: The study evaluates six LLMs and four MLLMs on Brazilian Portuguese medical exam questions, finding performance gaps, especially in multimodal tasks, and emphasizing the need for non-English AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biases in AI performance across languages and assess the capability of LLMs and MLLMs in non-English medical contexts.

Method: Benchmarked six LLMs and four MLLMs against human candidates using Brazilian Portuguese medical exam questions, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and explanation coherence.

Result: Some models (e.g., Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus) matched human accuracy, but gaps persisted in multimodal tasks. Language disparities highlighted the need for non-English fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Evaluating AI in diverse linguistic and clinical settings is crucial for fair healthcare deployment. Future work should focus on training improvements and real-world integration.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown the potential to revolutionize
healthcare by improving diagnostic accuracy, optimizing workflows, and
personalizing treatment plans. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable advancements in natural
language processing and medical applications. However, the evaluation of these
models has focused predominantly on the English language, leading to potential
biases in their performance across different languages.
  This study investigates the capability of six LLMs (GPT-4.0 Turbo,
LLaMA-3-8B, LLaMA-3-70B, Mixtral 8x7B Instruct, Titan Text G1-Express, and
Command R+) and four MLLMs (Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3-Opus, Claude-3-Sonnet,
and Claude-3-Haiku) to answer questions written in Brazilian spoken portuguese
from the medical residency entrance exam of the Hospital das Cl\'inicas da
Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de S\~ao Paulo (HCFMUSP) - the largest
health complex in South America. The performance of the models was benchmarked
against human candidates, analyzing accuracy, processing time, and coherence of
the generated explanations.
  The results show that while some models, particularly Claude-3.5-Sonnet and
Claude-3-Opus, achieved accuracy levels comparable to human candidates,
performance gaps persist, particularly in multimodal questions requiring image
interpretation. Furthermore, the study highlights language disparities,
emphasizing the need for further fine-tuning and data set augmentation for
non-English medical AI applications.
  Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating generative AI in various
linguistic and clinical settings to ensure a fair and reliable deployment in
healthcare. Future research should explore improved training methodologies,
improved multimodal reasoning, and real-world clinical integration of AI-driven
medical assistance.

Motivation: To enable fine-grained evaluation of depression detection and explanation quality in LLMs, addressing gaps in prior datasets.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework using expert-annotated data, testing LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet) with zero-shot and few-shot prompting.

Result: Significant performance differences among LLMs in clinical explanation tasks, highlighting the role of human expertise.

Conclusion: Human-guided LLMs can improve transparency and safety in AI for mental health applications.

Abstract: Early detection of depression from online social media posts holds promise
for providing timely mental health interventions. In this work, we present a
high-quality, expert-annotated dataset of 1,017 social media posts labeled with
depressive spans and mapped to 12 depression symptom categories. Unlike prior
datasets that primarily offer coarse post-level labels
\cite{cohan-etal-2018-smhd}, our dataset enables fine-grained evaluation of
both model predictions and generated explanations.
  We develop an evaluation framework that leverages this clinically grounded
dataset to assess the faithfulness and quality of natural language explanations
generated by large language models (LLMs). Through carefully designed prompting
strategies, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with domain-adapted
examples, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs including GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
  Our comprehensive empirical analysis reveals significant differences in how
these models perform on clinical explanation tasks, with zero-shot and few-shot
prompting. Our findings underscore the value of human expertise in guiding LLM
behavior and offer a step toward safer, more transparent AI systems for
psychological well-being.

*Yi Su,Quantong Qiu,Yuechi Zhou,Juntao Li,Qingrong Xia,Ping Li,Xinyu Duan,Zhefeng Wang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CaliDrop, a calibration-enhanced token eviction strategy to mitigate accuracy loss in KV cache compression for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache's memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating bottlenecks in long-context scenarios. Existing token eviction methods reduce memory but degrade accuracy.

Method: CaliDrop leverages high similarity in nearby queries to perform speculative calibration on discarded tokens, improving accuracy while maintaining compression benefits.

Result: Experiments show CaliDrop significantly enhances the accuracy of existing token eviction methods under high compression ratios.

Conclusion: CaliDrop effectively balances memory efficiency and accuracy in KV cache compression for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require substantial computational resources
during generation. While the Key-Value (KV) cache significantly accelerates
this process by storing attention intermediates, its memory footprint grows
linearly with sequence length, batch size, and model size, creating a
bottleneck in long-context scenarios. Various KV cache compression techniques,
including token eviction, quantization, and low-rank projection, have been
proposed to mitigate this bottleneck, often complementing each other. This
paper focuses on enhancing token eviction strategies. Token eviction leverages
the observation that the attention patterns are often sparse, allowing for the
removal of less critical KV entries to save memory. However, this reduction
usually comes at the cost of notable accuracy degradation, particularly under
high compression ratios. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{CaliDrop}, a
novel strategy that enhances token eviction through calibration. Our
preliminary experiments show that queries at nearby positions exhibit high
similarity. Building on this observation, CaliDrop performs speculative
calibration on the discarded tokens to mitigate the accuracy loss caused by
token eviction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CaliDrop significantly
improves the accuracy of existing token eviction methods.

Motivation: Address societal biases in LLM outputs to ensure fairness and reduce harm, as current models often exhibit biased behavior.

Method: Proposes KLAAD, which combines Cross-Entropy, KL divergence, and Triplet losses to align attention distributions between stereotypical and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs.

Result: KLAAD improves bias mitigation on BBQ and BOLD benchmarks while preserving language modeling quality.

Conclusion: Attention-level alignment is a principled approach for reducing bias in generative language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit societal biases in their outputs,
prompting ethical concerns regarding fairness and harm. In this work, we
propose KLAAD (KL-Attention Alignment Debiasing), an attention-based debiasing
framework that implicitly aligns attention distributions between stereotypical
and anti-stereotypical sentence pairs without directly modifying model weights.
KLAAD introduces a composite training objective combining Cross-Entropy, KL
divergence, and Triplet losses, guiding the model to consistently attend across
biased and unbiased contexts while preserving fluency and coherence.
Experimental evaluation of KLAAD demonstrates improved bias mitigation on both
the BBQ and BOLD benchmarks, with minimal impact on language modeling quality.
The results indicate that attention-level alignment offers a principled
solution for mitigating bias in generative language models.

Motivation: To assess the consistency and reliability of LLMs in scoring writing tasks compared to human raters, particularly for AP Chinese exams.

Method: Used generalizability theory to compare score consistency between human and AI raters for story narration and email response tasks. Essays were scored by two human and seven AI raters, with holistic and analytic scores.

Result: Human raters were more reliable overall, but LLMs showed reasonable consistency, especially for story narration. Hybrid scoring (human + AI) improved reliability.

Conclusion: Hybrid scoring models combining human and AI raters can enhance reliability in large-scale writing assessments, though human raters remain more consistent overall.

Abstract: This study investigates the estimation of reliability for large language
models (LLMs) in scoring writing tasks from the AP Chinese Language and Culture
Exam. Using generalizability theory, the research evaluates and compares score
consistency between human and AI raters across two types of AP Chinese
free-response writing tasks: story narration and email response. These essays
were independently scored by two trained human raters and seven AI raters. Each
essay received four scores: one holistic score and three analytic scores
corresponding to the domains of task completion, delivery, and language use.
Results indicate that although human raters produced more reliable scores
overall, LLMs demonstrated reasonable consistency under certain conditions,
particularly for story narration tasks. Composite scoring that incorporates
both human and AI raters improved reliability, which supports that hybrid
scoring models may offer benefits for large-scale writing assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal NLP faces challenges in low-resource languages like Vietnamese due to limited annotated data, necessitating tailored datasets.

Method: The authors create the VLQA dataset and analyze it statistically, testing it on legal information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Result: The VLQA dataset proves effective for Vietnamese legal NLP tasks, as demonstrated by experiments with advanced models.

Conclusion: The VLQA dataset fills a critical gap for Vietnamese legal NLP, though broader automation of legal tasks remains a future goal.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has led to significant
achievements in various domains, including legal text processing. Leveraging
LLMs for legal tasks is a natural evolution and an increasingly compelling
choice. However, their capabilities are often portrayed as greater than they
truly are. Despite the progress, we are still far from the ultimate goal of
fully automating legal tasks using artificial intelligence (AI) and natural
language processing (NLP). Moreover, legal systems are deeply domain-specific
and exhibit substantial variation across different countries and languages. The
need for building legal text processing applications for different natural
languages is, therefore, large and urgent. However, there is a big challenge
for legal NLP in low-resource languages such as Vietnamese due to the scarcity
of resources and annotated data. The need for labeled legal corpora for
supervised training, validation, and supervised fine-tuning is critical. In
this paper, we introduce the VLQA dataset, a comprehensive and high-quality
resource tailored for the Vietnamese legal domain. We also conduct a
comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset and evaluate its
effectiveness through experiments with state-of-the-art models on legal
information retrieval and question-answering tasks.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting sparse and variable anomalies like spam, fake news, and hate speech with limited labeled data.

Method: Treats anomaly detection as few-shot binary classification, using episodic training, prototypical networks, and domain resampling.

Result: Outperforms baselines in F1 and AUC scores on datasets like SMS spam, COVID-19 fake news, and hate speech.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes well to unseen tasks with minimal labeled anomalies, and code is released for further research.

Abstract: We propose a meta learning framework for detecting anomalies in human
language across diverse domains with limited labeled data. Anomalies in
language ranging from spam and fake news to hate speech pose a major challenge
due to their sparsity and variability. We treat anomaly detection as a few shot
binary classification problem and leverage meta-learning to train models that
generalize across tasks. Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19
fake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks
with minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with
prototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly
detection tasks. Empirical results show that our method outperforms strong

*Runchao Li,Yao Fu,Mu Sheng,Xianxuan Long,Haotian Yu,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAEDKV is a training-free KV cache compression framework for LLMs that uses frequency-domain transformation to retain unbiased information, outperforming existing methods by up to 22%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KV cache compression methods introduce bias by overemphasizing recent tokens or degrading early context, often requiring costly retraining.

Method: FAEDKV transforms the KV cache into the frequency domain using Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT) and performs layer-wise compression based on critical spectral components.

Result: FAEDKV achieves up to 22% better performance on LongBench and superior position-agnostic retrieval accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task.

Conclusion: FAEDKV offers an effective, unbiased solution for KV cache compression without the need for retraining, enhancing LLM performance in long-context tasks.

Abstract: The efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context tasks is often
hampered by the substantial memory footprint and computational demands of the
Key-Value (KV) cache. Current compression strategies, including token eviction
and learned projections, frequently lead to biased representations -- either by
overemphasizing recent/high-attention tokens or by repeatedly degrading
information from earlier context -- and may require costly model retraining. We
present FAEDKV (Frequency-Adaptive Infinite-Window for KV cache), a novel,
training-free KV cache compression framework that ensures unbiased information
retention. FAEDKV operates by transforming the KV cache into the frequency
domain using a proposed Infinite-Window Fourier Transform (IWDFT). This
approach allows for the equalized contribution of all tokens to the compressed
representation, effectively preserving both early and recent contextual
information. A preliminary frequency ablation study identifies critical
spectral components for layer-wise, targeted compression. Experiments on
LongBench benchmark demonstrate FAEDKV's superiority over existing methods by
up to 22\%. In addition, our method shows superior, position-agnostic retrieval
accuracy on the Needle-In-A-Haystack task compared to compression based

### [251] [Infogen: Generating Complex Statistical Infographics from Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20046)
*Akash Ghosh,Aparna Garimella,Pritika Ramu,Sambaran Bandyopadhyay,Sriparna Saha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Infogen, a two-stage framework for generating complex statistical infographics from text-heavy documents, outperforming existing LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI tools only generate simple charts, lacking the ability to create complex infographics requiring deep content understanding.

Method: Infogen uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate metadata (title, insights, sub-chart details) and converts it into infographic code.

Result: Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Infodat benchmark, surpassing other LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap in generating contextually accurate and visually aligned statistical infographics.

Abstract: Statistical infographics are powerful tools that simplify complex data into
visually engaging and easy-to-understand formats. Despite advancements in AI,
particularly with LLMs, existing efforts have been limited to generating simple
charts, with no prior work addressing the creation of complex infographics from
text-heavy documents that demand a deep understanding of the content. We
address this gap by introducing the task of generating statistical infographics
composed of multiple sub-charts (e.g., line, bar, pie) that are contextually
accurate, insightful, and visually aligned. To achieve this, we define
infographic metadata that includes its title and textual insights, along with
sub-chart-specific details such as their corresponding data and alignment. We
also present Infodat, the first benchmark dataset for text-to-infographic
metadata generation, where each sample links a document to its metadata. We
propose Infogen, a two-stage framework where fine-tuned LLMs first generate
metadata, which is then converted into infographic code. Extensive evaluations
on Infodat demonstrate that Infogen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both closed and open-source LLMs in text-to-statistical
infographic generation.

### [252] [A Tensor-Based Compiler and a Runtime for Neuron-Level DNN Certifier Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20055)
*Avaljot Singh,Yamin Chandini Sarita,Aditya Mishra,Ishaan Goyal,Gagandeep Singh,Charith Mendis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A compiler framework is proposed to bridge the gap between neuron-level DNN certifier designs and tensor-level implementations, enabling easier development and optimization of certifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in developing or modifying DNN certifiers due to the semantic gap between neuron-level design and tensor-level implementation.

Method: A compiler framework with a stack-based intermediate representation (IR) and shape analysis to translate neuron-level specifications into tensor-based implementations, along with a novel double-compression format (g-BCSR) for sparse tensors.

Result: The framework simplifies certifier development, achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations, and introduces g-BCSR for efficient tensor handling.

Conclusion: The proposed compiler and g-BCSR format facilitate the creation and analysis of DNN certifiers, bridging the design-implementation gap effectively.

Abstract: The uninterpretability of DNNs has led to the adoption of abstract
interpretation-based certification as a practical means to establish trust in
real-world systems that rely on DNNs. However, the current landscape supports
only a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing
ones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the
mathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their
implementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch
creates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual
bridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in
formal methods, high-performance computing, etc.
  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level
specifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level
implementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based
intermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit
tensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During
lifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to
perform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific
optimizations as rewrites. At runtime, the resulting tensor computations
exhibit sparsity tied to the DNN architecture. This sparsity does not align
well with existing formats. To address this, we introduce g-BCSR, a
double-compression format that represents tensors as collections of blocks of
varying sizes, each possibly internally sparse.
  Using our compiler and g-BCSR, we make it easy to develop new certifiers and
analyze their utility across diverse DNNs. Despite its flexibility, the
compiler achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized implementations.

*Ran Xu,Yuchen Zhuang,Yue Yu,Haoyu Wang,Wenqi Shi,Carl Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAG improves LLMs with external knowledge but has limitations in diverse retrieval scenarios, as shown by evaluations on MassiveDS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore RAG's effectiveness beyond general-domain benchmarks and understand its real-world applicability.

Method: Evaluated RAG systems using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixed knowledge, analyzing retrieval benefits, reranker value, and query routing.

Result: Retrieval mainly aids smaller models, rerankers add little value, no single source excels, and LLMs struggle with heterogeneous knowledge routing.

Conclusion: Adaptive retrieval strategies are needed for real-world RAG deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating external knowledge retrieved at inference time. While RAG
demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks largely derived from
general-domain corpora like Wikipedia, its effectiveness under realistic,
diverse retrieval scenarios remains underexplored. We evaluated RAG systems
using MassiveDS, a large-scale datastore with mixture of knowledge, and
identified critical limitations: retrieval mainly benefits smaller models,
rerankers add minimal value, and no single retrieval source consistently
excels. Moreover, current LLMs struggle to route queries across heterogeneous
knowledge sources. These findings highlight the need for adaptive retrieval
strategies before deploying RAG in real-world settings. Our code and data can

### [254] [ProsodyLM: Uncovering the Emerging Prosody Processing Capabilities in Speech Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20091)
*Kaizhi Qian,Xulin Fan,Junrui Ni,Slava Shechtman,Mark Hasegawa-Johnson,Chuang Gan,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProsodyLM introduces a novel tokenization scheme to improve prosody learning in speech language models, outperforming traditional methods by retaining more prosody information and enabling diverse emerging capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech language models struggle to capture the interdependency between content and prosody due to sub-optimal tokenization methods.

Method: ProsodyLM transcribes speech into text followed by word-level prosody tokens, enhancing prosody retention and LLM compatibility.

Result: ProsodyLM demonstrates diverse emerging prosody capabilities, including nuanced speech generation, emotion understanding, and long-context consistency.

Conclusion: ProsodyLM's tokenization scheme effectively addresses prosody learning limitations, enabling advanced speech processing and understanding.

Abstract: Speech language models refer to language models with speech processing and
understanding capabilities. One key desirable capability for speech language
models is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content
and prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language
models, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into
LLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the
resulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities
via pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which
introduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each
speech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of
word-level prosody tokens. Compared with conventional speech tokenization
schemes, the proposed tokenization scheme retains more complete prosody
information, and is more understandable to text-based LLMs. We find that
ProsodyLM can learn surprisingly diverse emerging prosody processing
capabilities through pre-training alone, ranging from harnessing the prosody
nuances in generated speech, such as contrastive focus, understanding emotion
and stress in an utterance, to maintaining prosody consistency in long
contexts.

*Rodrigo Gabriel Salazar Alva,Matías Nuñez,Cristian López,Javier Martín Arista*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable framework using LLMs to generate high-quality Old English texts, combining LoRA, backtranslation, and a dual-agent pipeline, achieving significant improvements in translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving ancient languages like Old English is crucial for cultural and linguistic heritage, but it remains under-resourced for NLP.

Method: Uses LoRA for fine-tuning, backtranslation for data augmentation, and a dual-agent pipeline for content generation and translation.

Result: BLEU scores improved from 26 to over 65; expert assessment confirmed high grammatical accuracy and stylistic fidelity.

Conclusion: The framework not only expands the Old English corpus but also provides a blueprint for revitalizing other endangered languages.

Abstract: Preserving ancient languages is essential for understanding humanity's
cultural and linguistic heritage, yet Old English remains critically
under-resourced, limiting its accessibility to modern natural language
processing (NLP) techniques. We present a scalable framework that uses advanced
large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality Old English texts,
addressing this gap. Our approach combines parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA), data augmentation via backtranslation, and a
dual-agent pipeline that separates the tasks of content generation (in English)
and translation (into Old English). Evaluation with automated metrics (BLEU,
METEOR, and CHRF) shows significant improvements over baseline models, with
BLEU scores increasing from 26 to over 65 for English-to-Old English
translation. Expert human assessment also confirms high grammatical accuracy
and stylistic fidelity in the generated texts. Beyond expanding the Old English
corpus, our method offers a practical blueprint for revitalizing other
endangered languages, effectively uniting AI innovation with the goals of
cultural preservation.

*Anas Mohamed,Azal Ahmad Khan,Xinran Wang,Ahmad Faraz Khan,Shuwen Ge,Saman Bahzad Khan,Ayaan Ahmad,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sem-DPO improves DPO by ensuring semantic consistency in prompt optimization, outperforming DPO and baselines in text-to-image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic drift in DPO's prompt optimization, where higher preference scores may not align with user intent.

Method: Introduces Sem-DPO, scaling DPO loss by cosine distance between original and optimized prompts to preserve semantics.

Result: Achieves 8-12% higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% better human-preference scores than DPO.

Conclusion: Sem-DPO sets a new standard for prompt optimization and enables broader semantics-aware preference tuning.

Abstract: Generative AI can now synthesize strikingly realistic images from text, yet
output quality remains highly sensitive to how prompts are phrased. Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) offers a lightweight, off-policy alternative to
RL for automatic prompt engineering, but its token-level regularization leaves
semantic inconsistency unchecked as prompts that win higher preference scores
can still drift away from the user's intended meaning.
  We introduce Sem-DPO, a variant of DPO that preserves semantic consistency
yet retains its simplicity and efficiency. Sem-DPO scales the DPO loss by an
exponential weight proportional to the cosine distance between the original
prompt and winning candidate in embedding space, softly down-weighting training
signals that would otherwise reward semantically mismatched prompts. We provide
the first analytical bound on semantic drift for preference-tuned prompt
generators, showing that Sem-DPO keeps learned prompts within a provably
bounded neighborhood of the original text. On three standard text-to-image
prompt-optimization benchmarks and two language models, Sem-DPO achieves 8-12%
higher CLIP similarity and 5-9% higher human-preference scores (HPSv2.1,
PickScore) than DPO, while also outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These
findings suggest that strong flat baselines augmented with semantic weighting
should become the new standard for prompt-optimization studies and lay the
groundwork for broader, semantics-aware preference optimization in language
models.

*Baiyu Chen,Wilson Wongso,Xiaoqian Hu,Yue Tan,Flora Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Team CRUISE's solution for KDD Cup 2025 CRAG-MM challenge addresses VLMs' hallucination issues with a multi-stage framework, achieving 3rd place by prioritizing factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern VLMs often hallucinate with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and multi-hop questions, limiting real-world applicability for fact-seeking queries.

Method: A multi-stage framework with query routing, retrieval, summarization, dual-path generation, and post-hoc verification to minimize hallucinations.

Result: Achieved 3rd place in Task 1, validating the approach's effectiveness in ensuring answer reliability.

Conclusion: Prioritizing factual accuracy over completeness in multi-modal RAG systems reduces hallucinations and improves performance.

Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the
KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn
(CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of
modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate,
especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex,
multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world
applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual
accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust,
multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over
completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for
efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways
generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed
to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's
scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the
effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG
systems. Our implementation is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of Document Understanding (DU) in long-context scenarios, proposing an automated multi-agent framework to generate high-quality questions for training LVLMs, particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) declines in long-context DU tasks due to a lack of fine-grained training data, especially for low-resource languages.

Method: A fully automated, multi-agent interactive framework is introduced to generate long-context questions efficiently for English and Arabic documents.

Result: The generated questions (AraEngLongBench) prove challenging for major LVLMs, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances LVLMs' long-context understanding and provides valuable resources for future research.

Abstract: Document Understanding (DU) in long-contextual scenarios with complex layouts
remains a significant challenge in vision-language research. Although Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at short-context DU tasks, their
performance declines in long-context settings. A key limitation is the scarcity
of fine-grained training data, particularly for low-resource languages such as
Arabic. Existing state-of-the-art techniques rely heavily on human annotation,
which is costly and inefficient. We propose a fully automated, multi-agent
interactive framework to generate long-context questions efficiently. Our
approach efficiently generates high-quality single- and multi-page questions
for extensive English and Arabic documents, covering hundreds of pages across
diverse domains. This facilitates the development of LVLMs with enhanced
long-context understanding ability. Experimental results in this work have
shown that our generated English and Arabic questions
(\textbf{AraEngLongBench}) are quite challenging to major open- and
close-source LVLMs. The code and data proposed in this work can be found in

Answer (QA) pairs and structured system prompts can be found in the Appendix.

*Shuhaib Mehri,Xiaocheng Yang,Takyoung Kim,Gokhan Tur,Shikib Mehri,Dilek Hakkani-Tür*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces User Goal State Tracking (UGST) to improve goal-oriented behavior in user simulators for conversational AI, demonstrating significant improvements in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with consistent goal-oriented behavior in multi-turn conversations, limiting their reliability in applications.

Method: A three-stage methodology using UGST to track goal progression and generate goal-aligned responses, evaluated on MultiWOZ 2.4 and τ-Bench.

Result: Substantial improvements in goal alignment metrics across benchmarks.

Conclusion: UGST addresses a critical gap in conversational AI, providing a framework for developing reliable, goal-aligned user simulators.

Abstract: User simulators are essential to conversational AI, enabling scalable agent
development and evaluation through simulated interactions. While current Large
Language Models (LLMs) have advanced user simulation capabilities, we reveal
that they struggle to consistently demonstrate goal-oriented behavior across
multi-turn conversations--a critical limitation that compromises their
reliability in downstream applications. We introduce User Goal State Tracking
(UGST), a novel framework that tracks user goal progression throughout
conversations. Leveraging UGST, we present a three-stage methodology for
developing user simulators that can autonomously track goal progression and
reason to generate goal-aligned responses. Moreover, we establish comprehensive
evaluation metrics for measuring goal alignment in user simulators, and
demonstrate that our approach yields substantial improvements across two
benchmarks (MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench). Our contributions address a
critical gap in conversational AI and establish UGST as an essential framework
for developing goal-aligned user simulators.

### [260] [SGPO: Self-Generated Preference Optimization based on Self-Improver](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20181)
*Hyeonji Lee,Daejin Jo,Seohwan Yun,Sungwoong Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGPO is a self-improving alignment framework for LLMs that generates its own preference data, outperforming DPO and baselines without external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need alignment to human preferences, but conventional methods rely on human-annotated data, causing distribution shifts and limited applicability.

Method: SGPO uses an on-policy self-improver to refine responses and generate preference data for DPO, unifying the improver and policy in one model.

Result: SGPO outperforms DPO and baseline methods on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard without external preference data.

Conclusion: SGPO offers a scalable and effective alignment solution by self-generating high-quality preference data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their extensive pretraining on diverse
datasets, require effective alignment to human preferences for practical and
reliable deployment. Conventional alignment methods typically employ off-policy
learning and depend on human-annotated datasets, which limits their broad
applicability and introduces distribution shift issues during training. To
address these challenges, we propose Self-Generated Preference Optimization
based on Self-Improver (SGPO), an innovative alignment framework that leverages
an on-policy self-improving mechanism. Specifically, the improver refines
responses from a policy model to self-generate preference data for direct
preference optimization (DPO) of the policy model. Here, the improver and
policy are unified into a single model, and in order to generate higher-quality
preference data, this self-improver learns to make incremental yet discernible
improvements to the current responses by referencing supervised fine-tuning
outputs. Experimental results on AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard show that the
proposed SGPO significantly improves performance over DPO and baseline
self-improving methods without using external preference data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an intention tree concept and a dataset curation pipeline to model customer intentions in E-commerce sessions, addressing prior limitations in capturing user preferences. It proposes SessionIntentBench, a multimodal benchmark with four subtasks, and shows that current models struggle with intention understanding, though intention injection improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works fail to effectively model customer intentions due to insufficient information exploitation and lack of benchmarks for E-commerce session data.

Method: The authors introduce an intention tree and a dataset curation pipeline, constructing SessionIntentBench with mined data (1.9M intention entries, 1.1M trajectories) and human-annotated ground truth.

Result: Experiments reveal current L(V)LMs struggle with intention understanding in complex sessions, but intention injection enhances their performance.

Conclusion: The work provides a scalable solution for intention modeling in E-commerce sessions, highlighting the need for better intention-aware models.

Abstract: Session history is a common way of recording user interacting behaviors
throughout a browsing activity with multiple products. For example, if an user
clicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain
features that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of
on-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and
model customer intention effectively because insufficient information
exploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are
used. There is also a lack of data and corresponding benchmark for explicitly
modeling intention in E-commerce product purchase sessions. To address these
issues, we introduce the concept of an intention tree and propose a dataset
curation pipeline. Together, we construct a sibling multimodal benchmark,
SessionIntentBench, that evaluates L(V)LMs' capability on understanding
inter-session intention shift with four subtasks. With 1,952,177 intention
entries, 1,132,145 session intention trajectories, and 13,003,664 available
tasks mined using 10,905 sessions, we provide a scalable way to exploit the
existing session data for customer intention understanding. We conduct human
annotations to collect ground-truth label for a subset of collected data to
form an evaluation gold set. Extensive experiments on the annotated data
further confirm that current L(V)LMs fail to capture and utilize the intention
across the complex session setting. Further analysis show injecting intention
enhances LLMs' performances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiRole-R1 enhances subjective reasoning in large models by incorporating diverse role perspectives, improving accuracy and diversity through unsupervised data construction and reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large reasoning models perform well on objective tasks but struggle with subjective questions due to homogeneous reasoning. Increasing role perspectives improves performance, motivating the need for diversity-enhanced frameworks.

Method: Proposes MultiRole-R1, featuring unsupervised data construction for diverse reasoning chains and reinforcement learning (GRPO) with reward shaping to promote diversity.

Result: Experiments on six benchmarks show improved accuracy and diversity in subjective and objective reasoning, highlighting the positive relation between diversity and accuracy.

Conclusion: MultiRole-R1 demonstrates the potential of diversity-enhanced training in large reasoning models, enhancing both subjective and objective reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRM) with long chain-of-thought (CoT) capabilities
have shown strong performance on objective tasks, such as math reasoning and
coding. However, their effectiveness on subjective questions that may have
different responses from different perspectives is still limited by a tendency
towards homogeneous reasoning, introduced by the reliance on a single ground
truth in supervised fine-tuning and verifiable reward in reinforcement
learning. Motivated by the finding that increasing role perspectives
consistently improves performance, we propose MultiRole-R1, a
diversity-enhanced framework with multiple role perspectives, to improve the
accuracy and diversity in subjective reasoning tasks. MultiRole-R1 features an
unsupervised data construction pipeline that generates reasoning chains that
incorporate diverse role perspectives. We further employ reinforcement learning
via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with reward shaping, by taking
diversity as a reward signal in addition to the verifiable reward. With
specially designed reward functions, we successfully promote perspective
diversity and lexical diversity, uncovering a positive relation between
reasoning diversity and accuracy. Our experiment on six benchmarks demonstrates
MultiRole-R1's effectiveness and generalizability in enhancing both subjective
and objective reasoning, showcasing the potential of diversity-enhanced
training in LRMs.

*Aviya Maimon,Amir DN Cohen,Gal Vishne,Shauli Ravfogel,Reut Tsarfaty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation paradigm using factor analysis to identify latent skills in LLMs, addressing the limitations of current benchmark-based assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmark scores for LLMs lack interpretability and fail to capture holistic model strengths and limitations, necessitating a better evaluation approach.

Method: The authors use factor analysis on a dataset of 60 LLMs evaluated across 44 tasks to uncover latent skills driving performance.

Result: A small set of latent skills is identified, explaining most of the performance variance, and practical tools are developed for task redundancy, model selection, and skill profiling.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm offers a more nuanced and interpretable way to evaluate LLMs, moving beyond simplistic benchmark averaging.

Abstract: Current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) rely on benchmark scores,
but it is difficult to interpret what these individual scores reveal about a
model's overall skills. Specifically, as a community we lack understanding of
how tasks relate to one another, what they measure in common, how they differ,
or which ones are redundant. As a result, models are often assessed via a
single score averaged across benchmarks, an approach that fails to capture the
models' wholistic strengths and limitations. Here, we propose a new evaluation
paradigm that uses factor analysis to identify latent skills driving
performance across benchmarks. We apply this method to a comprehensive new
leaderboard showcasing the performance of 60 LLMs on 44 tasks, and identify a
small set of latent skills that largely explain performance. Finally, we turn
these insights into practical tools that identify redundant tasks, aid in model
selection, and profile models along each latent skill.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Co-NAML-LSTUR is a hybrid news recommendation framework combining multi-view news modeling (NAML) and dual-scale user interest modeling (LSTUR), outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on MIND benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of modeling multi-view news representations and dynamic user interests (short- and long-term) in news recommendation systems.

Method: Integrates NAML for multi-view news modeling and LSTUR for dual-scale user representations, enhanced with BERT-based embeddings.

Result: Substantial improvements over baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large benchmarks.

Conclusion: Combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale user modeling is effective for news recommendation.

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a vital role in mitigating information
overload by delivering personalized news content. A central challenge is to
effectively model both multi-view news representations and the dynamic nature
of user interests, which often span both short- and long-term preferences.
Existing methods typically rely on single-view features of news articles (e.g.,
titles or categories) or fail to comprehensively capture user preferences
across time scales. In this work, we propose Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news
recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news
modeling and LSTUR for capturing both long- and short-term user
representations. Our model also incorporates BERT-based word embeddings to
enhance semantic feature extraction. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely
used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Experimental results show that
Co-NAML-LSTUR achieves substantial improvements over most state-of-the-art
baselines on MIND-small and MIND-large, respectively. These results demonstrate
the effectiveness of combining multi-view news representations with dual-scale
user modeling. The implementation of our model is publicly available at

TL;DR: A framework combining INT (Interactive Narrative Therapist) and IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) improves mental health support by simulating expert therapy and tracking narrative shifts, outperforming standard LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based mental health support lacks realism and therapeutic progression, while narrative therapy is underutilized due to access and stigma.

Method: INT simulates expert narrative therapists with planned stages and expert-like responses. IMA quantifies therapy progress by tracking 'Innovative Moments' in client speech.

Result: INT outperforms standard LLMs in therapeutic quality and depth, as shown in experiments with 260 simulated clients and 230 human participants.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances mental health support by combining expert simulation and progress tracking, facilitating social applications.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities
for mental health support, yet current approaches lack realism in simulating
specialized psychotherapy and fail to capture therapeutic progression over
time. Narrative therapy, which helps individuals transform problematic life
stories into empowering alternatives, remains underutilized due to limited
access and social stigma. We address these limitations through a comprehensive
framework with two core components. First, INT (Interactive Narrative
Therapist) simulates expert narrative therapists by planning therapeutic
stages, guiding reflection levels, and generating contextually appropriate
expert-like responses. Second, IMA (Innovative Moment Assessment) provides a
therapy-centric evaluation method that quantifies effectiveness by tracking
"Innovative Moments" (IMs), critical narrative shifts in client speech
signaling therapy progress. Experimental results on 260 simulated clients and
230 human participants reveal that INT consistently outperforms standard LLMs
in therapeutic quality and depth. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
INT in synthesizing high-quality support conversations to facilitate social
applications.

Motivation: Professionalism in expert communication is underexplored, especially in high-stakes domains like finance. The study aims to quantify and model professionalism using linguistic features.

Method: A novel annotation framework quantifies structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst questions. Datasets include human-authored and LLM-generated questions, annotated for professionalism and origin.

Result: Linguistic features correlate with professionalism and authorship. A classifier using these features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines.

Conclusion: Professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be modeled linguistically, with implications for expert communication.

Abstract: Professionalism is a crucial yet underexplored dimension of expert
communication, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance. This paper
investigates how linguistic features can be leveraged to model and evaluate
professionalism in expert questioning. We introduce a novel annotation
framework to quantify structural and pragmatic elements in financial analyst
questions, such as discourse regulators, prefaces, and request types. Using
both human-authored and large language model (LLM)-generated questions, we
construct two datasets: one annotated for perceived professionalism and one
labeled by question origin. We show that the same linguistic features correlate
strongly with both human judgments and authorship origin, suggesting a shared
stylistic foundation. Furthermore, a classifier trained solely on these
interpretable features outperforms gemini-2.0 and SVM baselines in
distinguishing expert-authored questions. Our findings demonstrate that
professionalism is a learnable, domain-general construct that can be captured
through linguistically grounded modeling.

### [267] [Post-Completion Learning for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20252)
*Xiang Fei,Siqi Wang,Shu Wei,Yuxiang Nie,Wei Shi,Hao Feng,Can Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Post-Completion Learning (PCL) extends training beyond the <eos> token, enhancing reasoning and self-evaluation by leveraging post-completion space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional training stops at <eos>, missing learning opportunities in post-completion space. PCL aims to improve reasoning and self-assessment.

Method: Uses white-box RL for self-evaluation and reward alignment, combining dual-track SFT and RL for hybrid optimization.

Result: Consistent improvements over SFT and RL methods across datasets and models.

Conclusion: PCL offers a novel training approach, improving output quality without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Current language model training paradigms typically terminate learning upon
reaching the end-of-sequence (<eos>}) token, overlooking the potential learning
opportunities in the post-completion space. We propose Post-Completion Learning
(PCL), a novel training framework that systematically utilizes the sequence
space after model output completion, to enhance both the reasoning and
self-evaluation abilities. PCL enables models to continue generating
self-assessments and reward predictions during training, while maintaining
efficient inference by stopping at the completion point.
  To fully utilize this post-completion space, we design a white-box
reinforcement learning method: let the model evaluate the output content
according to the reward rules, then calculate and align the score with the
reward functions for supervision. We implement dual-track SFT to optimize both
reasoning and evaluation capabilities, and mixed it with RL training to achieve
multi-objective hybrid optimization.
  Experimental results on different datasets and models demonstrate consistent
improvements over traditional SFT and RL methods. Our method provides a new
technical path for language model training that enhances output quality while
preserving deployment efficiency.

### [268] [EMBRACE: Shaping Inclusive Opinion Representation by Aligning Implicit Conversations with Social Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20264)
*Abeer Aldayel,Areej Alokaili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques surface-level inclusion in conversation models and proposes a framework to evaluate implicit opinions using stance analysis for more equitable representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for inclusive representation in conversation models rely on overt cues like demographics, missing nuanced implicit opinions and risking harmful stereotypes.

Method: Introduces an alignment evaluation framework using stance of responses as a proxy for implicit opinions, tested with PU learning and instruction-tuned language models.

Result: The framework assesses normative alignment in models, revealing how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and suggesting improvements for inclusivity.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for deeper analysis of implicit opinions in models and offers a pathway to more inclusive and reflective representations.

Abstract: Shaping inclusive representations that embrace diversity and ensure fair
participation and reflections of values is at the core of many
conversation-based models. However, many existing methods rely on surface
inclusion using mention of user demographics or behavioral attributes of social
groups. Such methods overlook the nuanced, implicit expression of opinion
embedded in conversations. Furthermore, the over-reliance on overt cues can
exacerbate misalignment and reinforce harmful or stereotypical representations
in model outputs. Thus, we took a step back and recognized that equitable
inclusion needs to account for the implicit expression of opinion and use the
stance of responses to validate the normative alignment. This study aims to
evaluate how opinions are represented in NLP or computational models by
introducing an alignment evaluation framework that foregrounds implicit, often
overlooked conversations and evaluates the normative social views and
discourse. Our approach models the stance of responses as a proxy for the
underlying opinion, enabling a considerate and reflective representation of
diverse social viewpoints. We evaluate the framework using both (i)
positive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)
instruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment. Through
this, we provide a lens on how implicit opinions are (mis)represented and offer
a pathway toward more inclusive model behavior.

### [269] [MoL-RL: Distilling Multi-Step Environmental Feedback into LLMs for Feedback-Independent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20278)
*Kang Yang,Jingxue Chen,Qingkun Tang,Tianxiang Zhang,Qianchun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoL-RL is a new training paradigm for LLMs that integrates multi-step environmental feedback (EF) signals for feedback-independent reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches lose contextual EF information or fail to exploit multi-step EF interactions, limiting LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Method: MoL-RL combines MoL continual training (decoupling EF signals and language capabilities) with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF into single-step inferences.

Result: MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance on math and code benchmarks (e.g., MATH-500, CodeAgent-Test) with Qwen3-8B and generalizes well to smaller models (Qwen3-4B).

Conclusion: MoL-RL offers a robust method to enhance LLMs' reasoning by leveraging multi-step textual feedback without external loops.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in effectively
leveraging sequential environmental feedback (EF) signals, such as natural
language evaluations, for feedback-independent chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. Existing approaches either convert EF into scalar rewards, losing
rich contextual information, or employ refinement datasets, failing to exploit
the multi-step and discrete nature of EF interactions. To address these
limitations, we propose MoL-RL, a novel training paradigm that integrates
multi-step EF signals into LLMs through a dual-objective optimization
framework. Our method combines MoL (Mixture-of-Losses) continual training,
which decouples domain-specific EF signals (optimized via cross-entropy loss)
and general language capabilities (preserved via Kullback-Leibler divergence),
with GRPO-based post-training to distill sequential EF interactions into
single-step inferences. This synergy enables robust feedback-independent
reasoning without relying on external feedback loops. Experimental results on
mathematical reasoning (MATH-500, AIME24/AIME25) and code generation
(CodeAgent-Test) benchmarks demonstrate that MoL-RL achieves state-of-the-art
performance with the Qwen3-8B model, while maintaining strong generalization
across model scales (Qwen3-4B). This work provides a promising approach for
leveraging multi-step textual feedback to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities
in diverse domains.

### [270] [What Language(s) Does Aya-23 Think In? How Multilinguality Affects Internal Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20279)
*Katharina Trinley,Toshiki Nakai,Tatiana Anikina,Tanja Baeumel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Aya-23-8B, a multilingual LLM, processes languages differently than monolingual models, showing typological and script-based influences in translation, code-mixing, and neuron specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how multilingual LLMs like Aya-23-8B internally process languages compared to monolingual models, and how training data affects this.

Method: Analyzed Aya-23-8B using logit lens and neuron specialization techniques on code-mixed, cloze, and translation tasks, comparing it to Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2.

Result: Aya-23 activates related language representations for translation, shows base-language dominance in code-mixing, and has language-specific neurons in final layers. Script and typology influence processing.

Conclusion: Multilingual training shapes LLM internals distinctively, offering insights for cross-lingual transfer research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at multilingual tasks, yet their internal
language processing remains poorly understood. We analyze how Aya-23-8B, a
decoder-only LLM trained on balanced multilingual data, handles code-mixed,
cloze, and translation tasks compared to predominantly monolingual models like
Llama 3 and Chinese-LLaMA-2. Using logit lens and neuron specialization
analyses, we find: (1) Aya-23 activates typologically related language
representations during translation, unlike English-centric models that rely on
a single pivot language; (2) code-mixed neuron activation patterns vary with
mixing rates and are shaped more by the base language than the mixed-in one;
and (3) Aya-23's languagespecific neurons for code-mixed inputs concentrate in
final layers, diverging from prior findings on decoder-only models. Neuron
overlap analysis further shows that script similarity and typological relations
impact processing across model types. These findings reveal how multilingual
training shapes LLM internals and inform future cross-lingual transfer
research.

*Abdullah Alabdullah,Lifeng Han,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in Dialectal Arabic (DA) NLP by evaluating training-free prompting techniques and developing a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline for DA-MSA translation, achieving notable results with GPT-4o and quantized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The linguistic divide between DA and MSA limits digital access and hinders Arabic machine translation, necessitating solutions for low-resource settings.

Method: Evaluated prompting techniques (few-shot, zero-shot, chain-of-thought, Ara-TEaR) across six LLMs and developed a fine-tuning pipeline using quantized models.

Result: Few-shot prompting outperformed others, with GPT-4o leading. Quantized Gemma2-9B achieved a CHrF++ score of 49.88, and multi-dialect models improved performance by 10%.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical approach to enhance DA-MSA translation, demonstrating feasibility in low-resource settings and promoting dialectal inclusion in NLP.

Abstract: Dialectal Arabic (DA) poses a persistent challenge for natural language
processing (NLP), as most everyday communication in the Arab world occurs in
dialects that diverge significantly from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). This
linguistic divide limits access to digital services and educational resources
and impedes progress in Arabic machine translation. This paper presents two
core contributions to advancing DA-MSA translation for the Levantine, Egyptian,
and Gulf dialects, particularly in low-resource and computationally constrained
settings: a comprehensive evaluation of training-free prompting techniques, and
the development of a resource-efficient fine-tuning pipeline. Our evaluation of
prompting strategies across six large language models (LLMs) found that
few-shot prompting consistently outperformed zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and
our proposed Ara-TEaR method. GPT-4o achieved the highest performance across
all prompting settings. For fine-tuning, a quantized Gemma2-9B model achieved a
CHrF++ score of 49.88, outperforming zero-shot GPT-4o (44.58). Joint
multi-dialect trained models outperformed single-dialect counterparts by over
10% CHrF++, and 4-bit quantization reduced memory usage by 60% with less than
1% performance loss. The results and insights of our experiments offer a
practical blueprint for improving dialectal inclusion in Arabic NLP, showing
that high-quality DA-MSA machine translation is achievable even with limited
resources and paving the way for more inclusive language technologies.

TL;DR: DYNARTmo is a dynamic articulatory model for visualizing speech articulation in 2D, integrating control parameters and coarticulation, embedded in a web app for education and therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance phonetics education and speech therapy by providing a tool for visualizing speech articulation processes.

Method: Builds on UK-DYNAMO, uses articulatory underspecification, segmental/gestural control, and coarticulation with six articulators and 16 control parameters.

Result: A web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) with sagittal, glottal, and palatal views for static modeling.

Conclusion: Future work will focus on dynamic movement generation and articulatory-acoustic integration.

Abstract: We present DYNARTmo, a dynamic articulatory model designed to visualize
speech articulation processes in a two-dimensional midsagittal plane. The model
builds upon the UK-DYNAMO framework and integrates principles of articulatory
underspecification, segmental and gestural control, and coarticulation.
DYNARTmo simulates six key articulators based on ten continuous and six
discrete control parameters, allowing for the generation of both vocalic and
consonantal articulatory configurations. The current implementation is embedded
in a web-based application (SpeechArticulationTrainer) that includes sagittal,
glottal, and palatal views, making it suitable for use in phonetics education
and speech therapy. While this paper focuses on the static modeling aspects,
future work will address dynamic movement generation and integration with
articulatory-acoustic modules.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RMTBench is a user-centric bilingual role-playing benchmark for evaluating LLMs, featuring 80 diverse characters and 8,000+ dialogue rounds, focusing on user motivations and practical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM role-playing are character-centric and oversimplify interactions, failing to reflect real-world use. RMTBench addresses this by prioritizing user intentions.

Method: RMTBench includes 80 diverse characters and constructs dialogues based on explicit user motivations. It uses a multi-turn dialogue simulation and LLM-based scoring for evaluation.

Result: The benchmark provides a comprehensive framework for assessing LLM role-playing capabilities, aligning with practical deployment needs.

Conclusion: RMTBench bridges the gap between academic evaluation and real-world applications, offering a more effective assessment tool for LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown outstanding
potential for role-playing applications. Evaluating these capabilities is
becoming crucial yet remains challenging. Existing benchmarks mostly adopt a
\textbf{character-centric} approach, simplify user-character interactions to
isolated Q&A tasks, and fail to reflect real-world applications. To address
this limitation, we introduce RMTBench, a comprehensive \textbf{user-centric}
bilingual role-playing benchmark featuring 80 diverse characters and over 8,000
dialogue rounds. RMTBench includes custom characters with detailed backgrounds
and abstract characters defined by simple traits, enabling evaluation across
various user scenarios. Our benchmark constructs dialogues based on explicit
user motivations rather than character descriptions, ensuring alignment with
practical user applications. Furthermore, we construct an authentic multi-turn
dialogue simulation mechanism. With carefully selected evaluation dimensions
and LLM-based scoring, this mechanism captures the complex intention of
conversations between the user and the character. By shifting focus from
character background to user intention fulfillment, RMTBench bridges the gap
between academic evaluation and practical deployment requirements, offering a
more effective framework for assessing role-playing capabilities in LLMs. All
code and datasets will be released soon.

*Sangjun Moon,Dasom Choi,Jingun Kwon,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Manabu Okumura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLMs internally encode and control output sequence length, revealing that multi-head attention mechanisms play a key role. Length control is partially disentangled from semantic content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms behind LLMs' ability to control output sequence length, which remains unexplored.

Method: Empirical analysis of internal representations in LLMs, focusing on multi-head attention and scaling specific hidden units.

Result: Multi-head attention is critical for length control; hidden units adjust length without losing text informativeness. Some units reflect length-specific awareness.

Conclusion: LLMs have adaptable internal mechanisms for output length control, independent of external intervention.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, that are learned from massive amounts of text-based data.
Although LLMs can control output sequence length, particularly in
instruction-based settings, the internal mechanisms behind this control have
been unexplored yet. In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output
sequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in
LLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are
critical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a
disentangled manner. By scaling specific hidden units within the model, we can
control the output sequence length without losing the informativeness of the
generated text, thereby indicating that length information is partially
disentangled from semantic information. Moreover, some hidden units become
increasingly active as prompts become more length-specific, thus reflecting the
model's internal awareness of this attribute. Our findings suggest that LLMs
have learned robust and adaptable internal mechanisms for controlling output
length without any external control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoCoT, a three-stage cognitive prompting strategy, outperforms CoT and direct prompting in visual tasks by enhancing interpretability and social awareness in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of flat Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting in visual tasks requiring simultaneous perception, understanding, and judgment, especially in social contexts.

Method: Introduces Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a strategy with three stages: perception, situation, and norm, to scaffold VLM reasoning.

Result: CoCoT consistently outperforms CoT and direct prompting by +8% on average across multimodal benchmarks like intent disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety.

Conclusion: Cognitively grounded reasoning stages improve interpretability and social awareness in VLMs, enabling safer and more reliable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps models think step by step. But what
happens when they must see, understand, and judge-all at once? In visual tasks
grounded in social context, where bridging perception with norm-grounded
judgments is essential, flat CoT often breaks down. We introduce Cognitive
Chain-of-Thought (CoCoT), a prompting strategy that scaffolds VLM reasoning
through three cognitively inspired stages: perception, situation, and norm. Our
experiments show that, across multiple multimodal benchmarks (including intent
disambiguation, commonsense reasoning, and safety), CoCoT consistently
outperforms CoT and direct prompting (+8\% on average). Our findings
demonstrate that cognitively grounded reasoning stages enhance interpretability
and social awareness in VLMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable
multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CONCAP improves multilingual image captioning by combining retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, reducing data needs and performance gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of multilingual vision-language models, which suffer from scarce training data and reliance on translated captions, leading to mismatches and biases.

Method: Introduces CONCAP, a model integrating retrieved captions with image-specific concepts for better contextualization and grounding in multiple languages.

Result: Experiments on XM3600 show strong performance in low- and mid-resource languages with reduced data requirements.

Conclusion: Concept-aware retrieval augmentation effectively bridges multilingual performance gaps in image captioning.

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models have made significant strides in image
captioning, yet they still lag behind their English counterparts due to limited
multilingual training data and costly large-scale model parameterization.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers a promising alternative by
conditioning caption generation on retrieved examples in the target language,
reducing the need for extensive multilingual training. However, multilingual
RAG captioning models often depend on retrieved captions translated from
English, which can introduce mismatches and linguistic biases relative to the
source language. We introduce CONCAP, a multilingual image captioning model
that integrates retrieved captions with image-specific concepts, enhancing the
contextualization of the input image and grounding the captioning process
across different languages. Experiments on the XM3600 dataset indicate that
CONCAP enables strong performance on low- and mid-resource languages, with
highly reduced data requirements. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of
concept-aware retrieval augmentation in bridging multilingual performance gaps.

*Khloud AL Jallad,Nada Ghneim,Ghaida Rebdawi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A survey reviewing NLU benchmarks, focusing on diagnostics datasets and linguistic phenomena, highlighting gaps like lack of standardized evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze and compare NLU benchmarks, especially diagnostics datasets, and identify gaps in standardization for linguistic phenomena evaluation.

Method: Comprehensive review and comparison of English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with deep analysis of linguistic phenomena coverage.

Result: Identified lack of naming conventions and standardized evaluation metrics for diagnostics benchmarks, proposing a need for global hierarchy.

Conclusion: Advocates for standardized evaluation metrics in NLU diagnostics to improve model comparison and insights.

Abstract: Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is a basic task in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). The evaluation of NLU capabilities has become a trending
research topic that attracts researchers in the last few years, resulting in
the development of numerous benchmarks. These benchmarks include various tasks
and datasets in order to evaluate the results of pretrained models via public
leaderboards. Notably, several benchmarks contain diagnostics datasets designed
for investigation and fine-grained error analysis across a wide range of
linguistic phenomena. This survey provides a comprehensive review of available
English, Arabic, and Multilingual NLU benchmarks, with a particular emphasis on
their diagnostics datasets and the linguistic phenomena they covered. We
present a detailed comparison and analysis of these benchmarks, highlighting
their strengths and limitations in evaluating NLU tasks and providing in-depth
error analysis. When highlighting the gaps in the state-of-the-art, we noted
that there is no naming convention for macro and micro categories or even a
standard set of linguistic phenomena that should be covered. Consequently, we
formulated a research question regarding the evaluation metrics of the
evaluation diagnostics benchmarks: "Why do not we have an evaluation standard
for the NLU evaluation diagnostics benchmarks?" similar to ISO standard in
industry. We conducted a deep analysis and comparisons of the covered
linguistic phenomena in order to support experts in building a global hierarchy
for linguistic phenomena in future. We think that having evaluation metrics for
diagnostics evaluation could be valuable to gain more insights when comparing
the results of the studied models on different diagnostics benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a code-based prompting method for NER using LLMs, outperforming text-based prompting by embedding detailed BIO schema instructions in prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NER methods using LLMs rely only on input context, lacking detailed labeling instructions. The paper aims to improve LLMs' NER performance by structuring instructions explicitly.

Method: The method embeds code within prompts to provide detailed BIO schema instructions, leveraging LLMs' ability to understand programming languages. It also combines with chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: The code-based prompting method outperforms text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across multiple languages. Combining it with chain-of-thought further improves performance.

Conclusion: Explicitly structuring NER instructions via code-based prompting enhances LLMs' NER capabilities, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named
entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition
(NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches
have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels,
they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly,
ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling
requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose
a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities
of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts,
we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting
the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method
outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English,
Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of
explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the
proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting
further improves performance.

TL;DR: Text-JEPA is a lightweight framework for converting natural language to first-order logic, combining neural and symbolic methods for efficient and explainable reasoning in specialized domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in translating natural language to formal logic in closed-domain QA systems, where transparency and explainability are crucial.

Method: Introduces Text-JEPA, a neural-symbolic framework inspired by dual-system cognitive theory, using a lightweight model for logic representation and Z3 solver for inference.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with lower computational overhead compared to large LLM-based systems, validated by custom metrics.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for efficient and explainable QA in specialized domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced
question-answering (QA) capabilities, particularly in open-domain contexts.
However, in closed-domain scenarios such as education, healthcare, and law,
users demand not only accurate answers but also transparent reasoning and
explainable decision-making processes. While neural-symbolic (NeSy) frameworks
have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging LLMs for natural language
understanding and symbolic systems for formal reasoning, existing approaches
often rely on large-scale models and exhibit inefficiencies in translating
natural language into formal logic representations.
  To address these limitations, we introduce Text-JEPA (Text-based
Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture), a lightweight yet effective framework
for converting natural language into first-order logic (NL2FOL). Drawing
inspiration from dual-system cognitive theory, Text-JEPA emulates System 1 by
efficiently generating logic representations, while the Z3 solver operates as
System 2, enabling robust logical inference. To rigorously evaluate the
NL2FOL-to-reasoning pipeline, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework
comprising three custom metrics: conversion score, reasoning score, and
Spearman rho score, which collectively capture the quality of logical
translation and its downstream impact on reasoning accuracy.
  Empirical results on domain-specific datasets demonstrate that Text-JEPA
achieves competitive performance with significantly lower computational
overhead compared to larger LLM-based systems. Our findings highlight the
potential of structured, interpretable reasoning frameworks for building
efficient and explainable QA systems in specialized domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aquaculture faces challenges like disease outbreaks and inefficiencies; existing AI methods lack domain-specific solutions.

Method: Developed AQUA, an LLM for aquaculture, using the AQUADAPT framework to generate and refine synthetic data with expert knowledge and automated evaluation.

Result: AQUA and AQUADAPT provide a foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research and decision-making.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in AI for aquaculture, offering tools for farmers and researchers to tackle industry-specific problems.

Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies
by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet
rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks,
inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies,
and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water
quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant
progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the
domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed
to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this
effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic
Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a
combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated
evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations
in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.

TL;DR: SAND-Math introduces a pipeline for generating and enhancing difficult math problems to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality, challenging math training data limits LLM performance in mathematical reasoning.

Method: SAND-Math generates synthetic math problems and uses a 'Difficulty Hiking' step to systematically increase their complexity.

Result: Augmenting a baseline with SAND-Math data improved AIME25 benchmark performance by 17.85 points; Difficulty Hiking alone boosted performance from 46.38% to 49.23%.

Conclusion: SAND-Math provides a scalable toolkit for enhancing mathematical reasoning in LLMs, with released dataset and fine-tuned model.

Abstract: The demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated
mathematical reasoning is growing across industries. However, the development
of performant mathematical LLMs is critically bottlenecked by the scarcity of
difficult, novel training data. We introduce \textbf{SAND-Math} (Synthetic
Augmented Novel and Difficult Mathematics problems and solutions), a pipeline
that addresses this by first generating high-quality problems from scratch and
then systematically elevating their complexity via a new \textbf{Difficulty

findings. First, augmenting a strong baseline with SAND-Math data significantly
boosts performance, outperforming the next-best synthetic dataset by
\textbf{$\uparrow$ 17.85 absolute points} on the AIME25 benchmark. Second, in a
dedicated ablation study, we show our Difficulty Hiking process is highly
effective: by increasing average problem difficulty from 5.02 to 5.98, this
step lifts AIME25 performance from 46.38\% to 49.23\%. The full generation
pipeline, final dataset, and a fine-tuned model form a practical and scalable
toolkit for building more capable and efficient mathematical reasoning LLMs.

TL;DR: A multi-labeled scheme for annotating hate and counter-hate speech in social media, analyzing thematic and rhetorical dimensions using Aristotle's Logos, Ethos, and Pathos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the interaction between hate and counter-hate speech in social media and their impact on online behavior.

Method: Annotated 92 conversations (720 tweets) and conducted statistical analyses incorporating public metrics.

Result: Revealed patterns in thematic and rhetorical dimensions of hate and counter-hate speech, offering insights into their spread and counter-strategies.

Conclusion: Provides valuable insights into hate speech dynamics and effective countermeasures on social media.

Abstract: We introduce a novel multi-labeled scheme for joint annotation of hate and
counter-hate speech in social media conversations, categorizing hate and
counter-hate messages into thematic and rhetorical dimensions. The thematic
categories outline different discursive aspects of each type of speech, while
the rhetorical dimension captures how hate and counter messages are
communicated, drawing on Aristotle's Logos, Ethos and Pathos. We annotate a
sample of 92 conversations, consisting of 720 tweets, and conduct statistical
analyses, incorporating public metrics, to explore patterns of interaction
between the thematic and rhetorical dimensions within and between hate and
counter-hate speech. Our findings provide insights into the spread of hate
messages on social media, the strategies used to counter them, and their
potential impact on online behavior.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for detecting hallucinations in black-box LLM outputs by sampling future contexts to improve detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of detecting hallucinations in black-box LLM-generated text, which is critical as users encounter such outputs more frequently.

Method: Sampling future contexts to detect hallucinations, leveraging the persistence of hallucinations once introduced.

Result: Performance improvements across multiple methods using the proposed sampling approach.

Conclusion: The sampling-based framework effectively enhances hallucination detection in black-box LLM outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to generate plausible text on
online platforms, without revealing the generation process. As users
increasingly encounter such black-box outputs, detecting hallucinations has
become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we focus on developing
a hallucination detection framework for black-box generators. Motivated by the
observation that hallucinations, once introduced, tend to persist, we sample
future contexts. The sampled future contexts provide valuable clues for
hallucination detection and can be effectively integrated with various
sampling-based methods. We extensively demonstrate performance improvements
across multiple methods using our proposed sampling approach.

*Anaïs Ollagnier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic review of 49 studies on antisocial behavior (ASB) prediction, proposing a taxonomy of five core tasks and analyzing trends in modeling techniques and dataset challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragmentation in ASB prediction research by providing a unified taxonomy and synthesis of methods to improve platform safety and societal wellbeing.

Method: Systematic review of 49 studies, categorizing tasks into five types, analyzing modeling techniques, and assessing dataset impacts.

Result: Identified five core task types, trends in modeling (e.g., pre-trained language models), and challenges like dataset scarcity and temporal drift.

Conclusion: The review provides a framework to guide future research toward robust and socially responsible ASB prediction.

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media-including hate speech, harassment,
and trolling-poses growing challenges for platform safety and societal
wellbeing. While prior work has primarily focused on detecting harmful content
after it appears, predictive approaches aim to forecast future harmful
behaviors-such as hate speech propagation, conversation derailment, or user
recidivism-before they fully unfold. Despite increasing interest, the field
remains fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy or clear synthesis of existing
methods. This paper presents a systematic review of over 49 studies on ASB
prediction, offering a structured taxonomy of five core task types: early harm
detection, harm emergence prediction, harm propagation prediction, behavioral
risk prediction, and proactive moderation support. We analyze how these tasks
differ by temporal framing, prediction granularity, and operational goals. In
addition, we examine trends in modeling techniques-from classical machine
learning to pre-trained language models-and assess the influence of dataset
characteristics on task feasibility and generalization. Our review highlights
methodological challenges, such as dataset scarcity, temporal drift, and
limited benchmarks, while outlining emerging research directions including
multilingual modeling, cross-platform generalization, and human-in-the-loop
systems. By organizing the field around a coherent framework, this survey aims
to guide future work toward more robust and socially responsible ASB
prediction.

*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes OL-KGC, an ontology-enhanced method for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) using Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating neural-perceptual structural information and ontological knowledge to improve reasoning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based KGC methods rely on implicit knowledge representation, propagating errors and lacking conclusive reasoning. The goal is to enhance understanding by combining structural and ontological knowledge.

Method: OL-KGC embeds structural information into textual space using neural perceptual mechanisms, extracts ontological knowledge from KGs, and transforms it into LLM-comprehensible text for logic guidance.

Result: OL-KGC outperforms existing KGC methods on benchmarks FB15K-237, UMLS, and WN18RR, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: OL-KGC effectively integrates structural and ontological knowledge with LLMs, significantly improving KGC performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively adopted in Knowledge Graph
Completion (KGC), showcasing significant research advancements. However, as
black-box models driven by deep neural architectures, current LLM-based KGC
methods rely on implicit knowledge representation with parallel propagation of
erroneous knowledge, thereby hindering their ability to produce conclusive and
decisive reasoning outcomes. We aim to integrate neural-perceptual structural
information with ontological knowledge, leveraging the powerful capabilities of
LLMs to achieve a deeper understanding of the intrinsic logic of the knowledge.
We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive
experiments on three widely-used benchmarks -- FB15K-237, UMLS and WN18RR. The
experimental results demonstrate that OL-KGC significantly outperforms existing
mainstream KGC methods across multiple evaluation metrics, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMPO improves GRPO by optimizing the geometric mean of token-level rewards for stability and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's instability with outlier rewards and extreme importance sampling ratios motivated the development of GMPO.

Method: GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, reducing sensitivity to outliers and stabilizing training.

Result: GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by 4.1% on math benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GMPO offers a stable and superior alternative to GRPO, validated by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Recent advancements, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models by optimizing the
arithmetic mean of token-level rewards. However, GRPO suffers from unstable
policy updates when processing tokens with outlier importance-weighted rewards,
which manifests as extreme importance sampling ratios during training, i.e.,
the ratio between the sampling probabilities assigned to a token by the current
and old policies. In this work, we propose Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization
(GMPO), a stabilized variant of GRPO. Instead of optimizing the arithmetic
mean, GMPO maximizes the geometric mean of token-level rewards, which is
inherently less sensitive to outliers and maintains a more stable range of
importance sampling ratio. In addition, we provide comprehensive theoretical
and experimental analysis to justify the design and stability benefits of GMPO.
Beyond improved stability, GMPO-7B outperforms GRPO by an average of 4.1% on
multiple mathematical benchmarks and 1.4% on multimodal reasoning benchmark,
including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, OlympiadBench, Minerva, and Geometry3K. Code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smaller models like XLM-R outperform large LLMs in multilingual fact verification, achieving 57.7% macro-F1, highlighting limitations of LLMs in nuanced tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust automated fact verification systems to handle multilingual misinformation with fine-grained assessments.

Method: Evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models (XLM-R, mT5, Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo) on the X-Fact dataset using prompting and fine-tuning.

Result: XLM-R (270M parameters) outperforms larger LLMs (7-12B parameters) by 15.8%, achieving 57.7% macro-F1. LLMs show biases and struggle with evidence utilization.

Conclusion: Smaller, specialized models are more effective for fine-grained multilingual fact verification than general-purpose LLMs, impacting practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multilingual misinformation requires robust automated
fact verification systems capable of handling fine-grained veracity assessments
across diverse languages. While large language models have shown remarkable
capabilities across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness for multilingual claim
verification with nuanced classification schemes remains understudied. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five state-of-the-art language models on
the X-Fact dataset, which spans 25 languages with seven distinct veracity
categories. Our experiments compare small language models (encoder-based XLM-R
and mT5) with recent decoder-only LLMs (Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral Nemo)
using both prompting and fine-tuning approaches. Surprisingly, we find that
XLM-R (270M parameters) substantially outperforms all tested LLMs (7-12B
parameters), achieving 57.7% macro-F1 compared to the best LLM performance of
16.9%. This represents a 15.8% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art
(41.9%), establishing new performance benchmarks for multilingual fact
verification. Our analysis reveals problematic patterns in LLM behavior,
including systematic difficulties in leveraging evidence and pronounced biases
toward frequent categories in imbalanced data settings. These findings suggest
that for fine-grained multilingual fact verification, smaller specialized
models may be more effective than general-purpose large models, with important
implications for practical deployment of fact-checking systems.

*Gabriel Downer,Sean Craven,Damian Ruck,Jake Thomas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text2VLM is a pipeline converting text-only datasets into multimodal formats to evaluate VLMs' resilience against typographic prompt injection attacks, revealing vulnerabilities in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation datasets for VLMs focus on text-only prompts, neglecting visual vulnerabilities, which Text2VLM aims to address.

Method: Text2VLM transforms harmful text content into typographic images, creating multimodal prompts to test VLM resilience.

Result: Open-source VLMs show increased susceptibility to prompt injection with visual inputs, and lag behind closed-source models in performance.

Conclusion: Text2VLM offers a scalable tool for safety assessment, aiding the development of robust VLMs for real-world applications.

Abstract: The increasing integration of Visual Language Models (VLMs) into AI systems
necessitates robust model alignment, especially when handling multimodal
content that combines text and images. Existing evaluation datasets heavily
lean towards text-only prompts, leaving visual vulnerabilities under evaluated.
To address this gap, we propose \textbf{Text2VLM}, a novel multi-stage pipeline
that adapts text-only datasets into multimodal formats, specifically designed
to evaluate the resilience of VLMs against typographic prompt injection
attacks. The Text2VLM pipeline identifies harmful content in the original text
and converts it into a typographic image, creating a multimodal prompt for
VLMs. Also, our evaluation of open-source VLMs highlights their increased
susceptibility to prompt injection when visual inputs are introduced, revealing
critical weaknesses in the current models' alignment. This is in addition to a
significant performance gap compared to closed-source frontier models. We
validate Text2VLM through human evaluations, ensuring the alignment of
extracted salient concepts; text summarization and output classification align
with human expectations. Text2VLM provides a scalable tool for comprehensive
safety assessment, contributing to the development of more robust safety
mechanisms for VLMs. By enhancing the evaluation of multimodal vulnerabilities,
Text2VLM plays a role in advancing the safe deployment of VLMs in diverse,
real-world applications.

### [290] [Investigating Structural Pruning and Recovery Techniques for Compressing Multimodal Large Language Models: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20749)
*Yiran Huang,Lukas Thede,Massimiliano Mancini,Wenjia Xu,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes compressing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) via structural pruning and efficient recovery training, showing effective performance retention with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high computational and memory demands of MLLMs, current methods lack flexibility and efficiency.

Method: Combines layerwise and widthwise pruning with supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation, testing recovery with limited data.

Result: Widthwise pruning performs better in low-resource settings; 5% of data suffices for recovery, retaining 95% performance.

Conclusion: The approach offers practical compression for MLLMs without extensive resources or data, validated on LLaVA and Bunny models.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive
capabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose
significant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction
techniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),
but these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally
intensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs
through structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.
Specifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and
widthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside
supervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the
feasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the
available data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains
better performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational
resources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,
finetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression
levels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and
hidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning
levels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the
original training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.
Through empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and
Bunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming
to compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or
sufficient data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for multilingual faithfulness evaluation of LLMs using synthetic data and cross-lingual transfer learning, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multilingual faithfulness evaluators for LLMs without relying on expensive human-labeled data.

Method: Uses synthetic multilingual summarization data and cross-lingual transfer learning, comparing language-specific and mixed-language fine-tuning.

Result: Shows consistent relationship between LLM language capabilities and evaluation performance, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves multilingual faithfulness evaluation without extensive labeled data.

Abstract: The growing use of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for
automatic evaluation systems, particularly to address the challenge of
information hallucination. Although existing faithfulness evaluation approaches
have shown promise, they are predominantly English-focused and often require
expensive human-labeled training data for fine-tuning specialized models. As
LLMs see increased adoption in multilingual contexts, there is a need for
accurate faithfulness evaluators that can operate across languages without
extensive labeled data. This paper presents Self-Taught Evaluators for
Multilingual Faithfulness, a framework that learns exclusively from synthetic
multilingual summarization data while leveraging cross-lingual transfer
learning. Through experiments comparing language-specific and mixed-language
fine-tuning approaches, we demonstrate a consistent relationship between an
LLM's general language capabilities and its performance in language-specific
evaluation tasks. Our framework shows improvements over existing baselines,
including state-of-the-art English evaluators and machine translation-based
approaches.

TL;DR: A survey on general-purpose text embeddings (GPTE) in the era of pretrained language models (PLMs), covering their architecture, roles of PLMs, advanced applications, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing interest in text embeddings for NLP tasks and the emergence of PLMs have driven the development of GPTE, necessitating a comprehensive overview.

Method: The survey examines the fundamental architecture of GPTE, the roles of PLMs in embedding extraction and enhancement, and explores advanced applications like multilingual support and multimodal integration.

Result: The paper provides a detailed analysis of GPTE's current state, highlighting PLMs' contributions and advanced capabilities.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a reference for researchers, outlining future directions like bias mitigation and cognitive extensions, to advance GPTE beyond traditional goals.

Abstract: Text embeddings have attracted growing interest due to their effectiveness
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as
retrieval, classification, clustering, bitext mining, and summarization. With
the emergence of pretrained language models (PLMs), general-purpose text
embeddings (GPTE) have gained significant traction for their ability to produce
rich, transferable representations. The general architecture of GPTE typically
leverages PLMs to derive dense text representations, which are then optimized
through contrastive learning on large-scale pairwise datasets. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of GPTE in the era of PLMs, focusing on the
roles PLMs play in driving its development. We first examine the fundamental
architecture and describe the basic roles of PLMs in GPTE, i.e., embedding
extraction, expressivity enhancement, training strategies, learning objectives,
and data construction. Then, we describe advanced roles enabled by PLMs, such
as multilingual support, multimodal integration, code understanding, and
scenario-specific adaptation. Finally, we highlight potential future research
directions that move beyond traditional improvement goals, including ranking
integration, safety considerations, bias mitigation, structural information
incorporation, and the cognitive extension of embeddings. This survey aims to
serve as a valuable reference for both newcomers and established researchers
seeking to understand the current state and future potential of GPTE.

*Sam Osian,Arpan Dutta,Sahil Bhandari,Iain E. Buchan,Dan W. Joyce*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An automated language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit) was developed to analyze Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, identifying child-suicide cases more efficiently than manual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and limitations of manual curation and coding of PFD reports for identifying systemic hazards like child-suicide cases.

Method: Used a fully automated, open-source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline to process 4,249 PFD reports, replicating the ONS's manual coding frame.

Result: Identified 72 child-suicide PFD reports (double the ONS count) with high agreement (Cohen's κ = 0.82) and reduced processing time from months to minutes.

Conclusion: Automated LLM analysis can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews, offering scalable and timely insights for public health.

Abstract: Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, issued by coroners in England and
Wales, flag systemic hazards that may lead to further loss of life. Analysis of
these reports has previously been constrained by the manual effort required to
identify and code relevant cases. In 2025, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) published a national thematic review of child-suicide PFD reports ($\leq$
18 years), identifying 37 cases from January 2015 to November 2023 - a process
based entirely on manual curation and coding. We evaluated whether a fully
automated, open source "text-to-table" language-model pipeline (PFD Toolkit)
could reproduce the ONS's identification and thematic analysis of child-suicide
PFD reports, and assessed gains in efficiency and reliability. All 4,249 PFD
reports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD
Toolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases
where the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or
younger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern
sub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72
child-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded
clinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the
child-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the
LLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's
$\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script
runtime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one
that can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis
can reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial
data, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health
and safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.

*Yilun Qiu,Tianhao Shi,Xiaoyan Zhao,Fengbin Zhu,Yang Zhang,Fuli Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEP is a framework for personalized LLM outputs by modeling inter-user differences in latent space, outperforming baselines in review generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook inter-user differences and rely on ineffective language prompts, limiting personalization.

Method: DEP uses latent space embeddings to contrast user behavior with peers, filters features with a sparse autoencoder, and injects them into a frozen LLM.

Result: DEP outperforms baseline methods in personalized review generation across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: DEP effectively addresses personalization challenges by focusing on latent space differences, offering improved performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily
lives, leading to a growing demand for personalized outputs. Previous work
focuses on leveraging a user's own history, overlooking inter-user differences
that are crucial for effective personalization. While recent work has attempted
to model such differences, the reliance on language-based prompts often hampers
the effective extraction of meaningful distinctions. To address these issues,
we propose Difference-aware Embedding-based Personalization (DEP), a framework
that models inter-user differences in the latent space instead of relying on
language prompts. DEP constructs soft prompts by contrasting a user's embedding
with those of peers who engaged with similar content, highlighting relative
behavioral signals. A sparse autoencoder then filters and compresses both
user-specific and difference-aware embeddings, preserving only task-relevant
features before injecting them into a frozen LLM. Experiments on personalized
review generation show that DEP consistently outperforms baseline methods
across multiple metrics. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SnowCharmQ/DEP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper surveys diversity in NLP, proposing a unified taxonomy and framework for measuring it, based on ecology and economy theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ad hoc and inconsistent treatment of diversity in NLP and link it to better-theorized domains.

Method: Surveyed ACL Anthology papers from the past 6 years with 'diversity' or 'diverse' in their title, and proposed a taxonomy and framework.

Result: Identified inconsistent terminology and specialized settings, and introduced a unified framework with three dimensions: variety, balance, and disparity.

Conclusion: The study aims to improve formalization, understanding, and comparability of diversity measures in NLP.

Abstract: The concept of diversity has received increased consideration in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. This is due to various motivations
like promoting and inclusion, approximating human linguistic behavior, and
increasing systems' performance. Diversity has however often been addressed in
an ad hoc manner in NLP, and with few explicit links to other domains where
this notion is better theorized. We survey articles in the ACL Anthology from
the past 6 years, with "diversity" or "diverse" in their title. We find a wide
range of settings in which diversity is quantified, often highly specialized
and using inconsistent terminology. We put forward a unified taxonomy of why,
what on, where, and how diversity is measured in NLP. Diversity measures are
cast upon a unified framework from ecology and economy (Stirling, 2007) with 3
dimensions of diversity: variety, balance and disparity. We discuss the trends
which emerge due to this systematized approach. We believe that this study
paves the way towards a better formalization of diversity in NLP, which should
bring a better understanding of this notion and a better comparability between
various approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates open-source LLMs for clinical info extraction in Dutch, finding competitive performance with smaller models and highlighting the need for native-language processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary LLMs lack transparency and raise privacy concerns, limiting their use in healthcare. Open-source alternatives are needed.

Method: Assessed nine open-source LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark (28 tasks) using the llm_extractinator framework in a zero-shot setting.

Result: Smaller 14B models (Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, DeepSeek-R1-14B) performed well; Llama-3.3-70B was slightly better but costlier. English translation hurt performance.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs with the proposed framework offer effective, scalable, and privacy-friendly solutions for clinical info extraction in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Medical reports contain rich clinical information but are often unstructured
and written in domain-specific language, posing challenges for information
extraction. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise
in clinical natural language processing, their lack of transparency and data
privacy concerns limit their utility in healthcare. This study therefore
evaluates nine open-source generative LLMs on the DRAGON benchmark, which
includes 28 clinical information extraction tasks in Dutch. We developed
\texttt{llm\_extractinator}, a publicly available framework for information
extraction using open-source generative LLMs, and used it to assess model
performance in a zero-shot setting. Several 14 billion parameter models,
Phi-4-14B, Qwen-2.5-14B, and DeepSeek-R1-14B, achieved competitive results,
while the bigger Llama-3.3-70B model achieved slightly higher performance at
greater computational cost. Translation to English prior to inference
consistently degraded performance, highlighting the need of native-language
processing. These findings demonstrate that open-source LLMs, when used with
our framework, offer effective, scalable, and privacy-conscious solutions for
clinical information extraction in low-resource settings.

### [297] [Soft Injection of Task Embeddings Outperforms Prompt-Based In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20906)
*Jungwon Park,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Soft Injection of task embeddings for LLMs, outperforming traditional ICL by 10.1%-13.9% while reducing memory and compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency and effectiveness of task conditioning in LLMs by shifting from prompt-based to activation-based methods.

Method: Constructs task embeddings from few-shot ICL prompts and softly mixes them with attention head activations using pre-optimized parameters.

Result: Outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, with reduced memory and compute usage.

Conclusion: Soft Injection offers a new paradigm for task conditioning, enhancing performance and efficiency while providing insights into attention head roles.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
tasks by conditioning on input-output examples in the prompt, without requiring
any update in model parameters. While widely adopted, it remains unclear
whether prompting with multiple examples is the most effective and efficient
way to convey task information. In this work, we propose Soft Injection of task
embeddings. The task embeddings are constructed only once using few-shot ICL
prompts and repeatedly used during inference. Soft injection is performed by
softly mixing task embeddings with attention head activations using
pre-optimized mixing parameters, referred to as soft head-selection parameters.
This method not only allows a desired task to be performed without in-prompt
demonstrations but also significantly outperforms existing ICL approaches while
reducing memory usage and compute cost at inference time. An extensive
evaluation is performed across 57 tasks and 12 LLMs, spanning four model
families of sizes from 4B to 70B. Averaged across 57 tasks, our method
outperforms 10-shot ICL by 10.1%-13.9% across 12 LLMs. Additional analyses show
that our method also serves as an insightful tool for analyzing task-relevant
roles of attention heads, revealing that task-relevant head positions selected
by our method transfer across similar tasks but not across dissimilar ones --
underscoring the task-specific nature of head functionality. Our soft injection
method opens a new paradigm for reducing prompt length and improving task
performance by shifting task conditioning from the prompt space to the
activation space.

Motivation: To address the lack of multilingual medical QA resources and assess language models' capabilities in factual recall and reasoning for clinical scenarios.

Method: Created a dataset (MediQAl) with 32,603 French medical questions, categorized into three tasks and labeled as understanding/reasoning. Evaluated 14 language models on these tasks.

Result: Significant performance gap observed between factual recall and reasoning tasks, providing a benchmark for French medical QA.

Abstract: This work introduces MediQAl, a French medical question answering dataset
designed to evaluate the capabilities of language models in factual medical
recall and reasoning over real-world clinical scenarios. MediQAl contains
32,603 questions sourced from French medical examinations across 41 medical
subjects. The dataset includes three tasks: (i) Multiple-Choice Question with
Unique answer, (ii) Multiple-Choice Question with Multiple answer, and (iii)
Open-Ended Question with Short-Answer. Each question is labeled as
Understanding or Reasoning, enabling a detailed analysis of models' cognitive
capabilities. We validate the MediQAl dataset through extensive evaluation with
14 large language models, including recent reasoning-augmented models, and
observe a significant performance gap between factual recall and reasoning
tasks. Our evaluation provides a comprehensive benchmark for assessing language
models' performance on French medical question answering, addressing a crucial
gap in multilingual resources for the medical domain.

*Roberto Labadie-Tamayo,Adrian Jaques Böck,Djordje Slijepčević,Xihui Chen,Andreas Babic,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents solutions for identifying and classifying sexism in social media posts, using three models (SCBM, SCBMT, and XLM-RoBERTa) across three subtasks, achieving competitive results and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the widespread issue of sexism in online conversations by developing models to identify and classify sexist content in social media posts.

Method: Three models are implemented: SCBM (using human-interpretable adjectives), SCBMT (combining adjectives with transformer embeddings), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa. Metadata like annotators' demographics is also explored.

Result: XLM-RoBERTa ranks 6th for English and Spanish, and 4th for English in Soft-Soft evaluation. SCBMT achieves 7th for English and Spanish, and 6th for Spanish.

Conclusion: The models provide competitive performance and interpretability, with potential for leveraging metadata to enhance results.

Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To
help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks
(EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international
benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and
classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our
solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism
Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask
1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address
each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck
Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a
fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as
human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models
(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of
adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.
SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual
embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification
performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained
explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also
investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,
can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data
augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for
English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and
Spanish and 6th for Spanish.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect and edit factual inaccuracies in large language model outputs, focusing on financial domains, and demonstrates improved performance with fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucinations in large language models is critical for factual reliability, especially in high-stakes domains like finance.

Method: A synthetic dataset with tagged errors is created using a domain-specific error taxonomy. Four models (Phi-4, Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-14B) are fine-tuned for detection and editing.

Result: Fine-tuned Phi-4 shows an 8% F1 score improvement and 30% better detection than OpenAI-o3. Phi-4-mini remains competitive with minimal performance drop.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical solution for factual inconsistency detection and editing in financial text, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models pose a critical challenge for
applications requiring factual reliability, particularly in high-stakes domains
such as finance. This work presents an effective approach for detecting and
editing factually incorrect content in model-generated responses based on the
provided context. Given a user-defined domain-specific error taxonomy, we
construct a synthetic dataset by inserting tagged errors into financial
question-answering corpora and then fine-tune four language models, Phi-4,
Phi-4-mini, Qwen3-4B, and Qwen3-14B, to detect and edit these factual
inaccuracies. Our best-performing model, fine-tuned Phi-4, achieves an 8%
improvement in binary F1 score and a 30% gain in overall detection performance
compared to OpenAI-o3. Notably, our fine-tuned Phi-4-mini model, despite having
only 4 billion parameters, maintains competitive performance with just a 2%
drop in binary detection and a 0.1% decline in overall detection compared to
OpenAI-o3. Our work provides a practical solution for detecting and editing
factual inconsistencies in financial text generation while introducing a
generalizable framework that can enhance the trustworthiness and alignment of
large language models across diverse applications beyond finance. Our code and

*Max Peeperkorn,Tom Kouwenhoven,Dan Brown,Anna Jordanous*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning LLMs reduces output diversity, especially in creative tasks. A new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, helps reintroduce diversity while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the 'diversity gap' in LLM outputs caused by instruction-tuning, particularly for narrative generation tasks.

Method: Analyze diversity metrics for various LLMs, explore fine-tuning stages of OLMo models, and introduce conformative decoding to mitigate diversity loss.

Result: Instruction-tuning significantly decreases diversity, with DPO having the most impact. Conformative decoding increases diversity without compromising quality.

Conclusion: Conformative decoding effectively addresses the diversity loss in instruction-tuned LLMs, offering a practical solution for maintaining output variety.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) reduces the diversity of
their outputs, which has implications for many tasks, particularly for creative
tasks. This paper investigates the ``diversity gap'' for a writing prompt
narrative generation task. This gap emerges as measured by current diversity
metrics for various open-weight and open-source LLMs. The results show
significant decreases in diversity due to instruction-tuning. We explore the
diversity loss at each fine-tuning stage for the OLMo and OLMo 2 models to
further understand how output diversity is affected. The results indicate that
DPO has the most substantial impact on diversity. Motivated by these findings,
we present a new decoding strategy, conformative decoding, which guides an
instruct model using its more diverse base model to reintroduce output
diversity. We show that conformative decoding typically increases diversity and
even maintains or improves quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores memorization in fine-tuned LLMs, especially in the medical domain, using the PHEE dataset. It examines fine-tuning impacts, memorization detection, and verbatim reproduction, revealing key insights about weight matrices, perplexity, and LoRA ranks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how fine-tuning affects memorization in LLMs, particularly in privacy-sensitive domains like medicine, to balance performance and privacy.

Method: Uses membership inference attacks and generation tasks to assess memorization, analyzing weight matrices, perplexity, and LoRA rank effects.

Result: Value and Output matrices contribute more to memorization; lower perplexity increases memorization; higher LoRA ranks boost memorization with diminishing returns.

Conclusion: The findings highlight trade-offs between performance and privacy, aiding in developing responsible fine-tuning strategies for LLMs.

Abstract: This study investigates the mechanisms and factors influencing memorization
in fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), with a focus on the medical domain
due to its privacy-sensitive nature. We examine how different aspects of the
fine-tuning process affect a model's propensity to memorize training data,
using the PHEE dataset of pharmacovigilance events.
  Our research employs two main approaches: a membership inference attack to
detect memorized data, and a generation task with prompted prefixes to assess
verbatim reproduction. We analyze the impact of adapting different weight
matrices in the transformer architecture, the relationship between perplexity
and memorization, and the effect of increasing the rank in low-rank adaptation
(LoRA) fine-tuning.
  Key findings include: (1) Value and Output matrices contribute more
significantly to memorization compared to Query and Key matrices; (2) Lower
perplexity in the fine-tuned model correlates with increased memorization; (3)
Higher LoRA ranks lead to increased memorization, but with diminishing returns
at higher ranks.
  These results provide insights into the trade-offs between model performance
and privacy risks in fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings have implications for
developing more effective and responsible strategies for adapting large
language models while managing data privacy concerns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAJ-EVAL is a multi-agent framework for NLP evaluation that auto-generates diverse evaluator personas and uses group debates to produce multi-dimensional feedback, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world NLP applications require diverse human perspectives for evaluation, but human evaluators are scarce and costly. Existing LLM-as-a-judge methods lack well-designed personas and generalizability.

Method: MAJ-EVAL constructs evaluator personas from documents, instantiates LLM agents with these personas, and uses group debates for multi-dimensional feedback.

Result: MAJ-EVAL aligns better with human expert ratings than conventional automated metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods in educational and medical domains.

Conclusion: MAJ-EVAL addresses limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge approaches, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for multi-dimensional NLP evaluation.

Abstract: Nearly all human work is collaborative; thus, the evaluation of real-world
NLP applications often requires multiple dimensions that align with diverse
human perspectives. As real human evaluator resources are often scarce and
costly, the emerging "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm sheds light on a promising
approach to leverage LLM agents to believably simulate human evaluators. Yet,
to date, existing LLM-as-a-judge approaches face two limitations: persona
descriptions of agents are often arbitrarily designed, and the frameworks are
not generalizable to other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose
MAJ-EVAL, a Multi-Agent-as-Judge evaluation framework that can automatically
construct multiple evaluator personas with distinct dimensions from relevant
text documents (e.g., research papers), instantiate LLM agents with the
personas, and engage in-group debates with multi-agents to Generate
multi-dimensional feedback. Our evaluation experiments in both the educational
and medical domains demonstrate that MAJ-EVAL can generate evaluation results
that better align with human experts' ratings compared with conventional
automated evaluation metrics and existing LLM-as-a-judge methods.

*Haoxuan Ma,Xishun Liao,Yifan Liu,Chris Stanford,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a transformer-based method to model urban mobility for shift workers, addressing their underrepresentation in traditional transportation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shift workers (15-20% of the workforce) are underrepresented in transportation surveys, leading to biased planning. This study aims to correct this gap.

Method: A novel transformer-based approach uses fragmented GPS data to generate complete activity patterns for shift workers, employing period-aware embeddings and a transition-focused loss function.

Result: The method achieves strong alignment with GPS data (Average JSD < 0.02), producing behaviorally valid patterns.

Conclusion: The approach provides a tool for inclusive transportation planning by accurately representing shift workers' mobility needs.

Abstract: This paper addresses a critical gap in urban mobility modeling by focusing on
shift workers, a population segment comprising 15-20% of the workforce in
industrialized societies yet systematically underrepresented in traditional
transportation surveys and planning. This underrepresentation is revealed in
this study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark
differences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the
conventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we
introduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS
trajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for
individuals working non-standard hours. Our method employs periodaware temporal
embeddings and a transition-focused loss function specifically designed to
capture the unique activity rhythms of shift workers and mitigate the inherent
biases in conventional transportation datasets. Evaluation shows that the
generated data achieves remarkable distributional alignment with GPS data from
Los Angeles County (Average JSD < 0.02 for all evaluation metrics). By
transforming incomplete GPS traces into complete, representative activity
patterns, our approach provides transportation planners with a powerful data
augmentation tool to fill critical gaps in understanding the 24/7 mobility
needs of urban populations, enabling precise and inclusive transportation
planning.

TL;DR: A lightweight dual-path Spatiotemporal Network (sLSTM + Conv3D) improves traffic forecasting accuracy and generalization, outperforming ConvLSTM by 23% MAE reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is crucial for 5G resource management, but conventional AI struggles with complex spatial-temporal patterns due to user mobility.

Method: Proposes a dual-path network: Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for temporal modeling and a three-layer Conv3D for spatial feature extraction, fused for robust forecasting.

Result: 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM, 30% better generalization, and improved gradient stability/convergence.

Conclusion: The method is effective for large-scale 5G deployments, offering superior forecasting and generalization.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is vital for intelligent resource
management in 5G and beyond. However, conventional AI approaches often fail to
capture the intricate spatial and temporal patterns that exist, due to e.g.,
the mobility of users. We introduce a lightweight, dual-path Spatiotemporal
Network that leverages a Scalar LSTM (sLSTM) for efficient temporal modeling
and a three-layer Conv3D module for spatial feature extraction. A fusion layer
integrates both streams into a cohesive representation, enabling robust
forecasting. Our design improves gradient stability and convergence speed while
reducing prediction error. Evaluations on real-world datasets show superior
forecast performance over ConvLSTM baselines and strong generalization to
unseen regions, making it well-suited for large-scale, next-generation network
deployments. Experimental evaluation shows a 23% MAE reduction over ConvLSTM,
with a 30% improvement in model generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral learning framework replaces neural layers with wavelet-domain operations, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters and memory, while enabling faster convergence and lower inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and interpretable alternative to traditional neural models by leveraging spectral sparsity and wavelet transforms.

Method: The model operates entirely in the wavelet domain, applying learnable nonlinear transformations and adaptive wavelet basis selection (e.g., Haar, Daubechies). Implemented in PyTorch with 3D support, it avoids spatial convolutions or attention.

Result: Achieves 89.3% accuracy on SST-2 (close to a Transformer baseline at 90.1%) with 72% fewer parameters and 58% less memory. Faster convergence due to spectral sparsity.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of spectral learning for vision and language tasks, offering a compact and efficient alternative to overparameterized neural architectures.

Abstract: We introduce a fully spectral learning framework that eliminates traditional
neural layers by operating entirely in the wavelet domain. The model applies
learnable nonlinear transformations, including soft-thresholding and gain-phase
modulation, directly to wavelet coefficients. It also includes a differentiable
wavelet basis selection mechanism, enabling adaptive processing using families
such as Haar, Daubechies, and Biorthogonal wavelets.
  Implemented in PyTorch with full 3D support, the model maintains a spectral
pipeline without spatial convolutions or attention. On synthetic 3D denoising
and natural language tasks from the GLUE benchmark, including SST-2 sentiment
classification, the model achieves 89.3 percent accuracy, close to a 4-layer
Transformer baseline (90.1 percent), while using 72 percent fewer parameters
and 58 percent less peak memory. Faster early convergence is observed due to
spectral sparsity priors.
  In contrast to the quadratic complexity of self-attention and large matrix
multiplications in Transformers, our approach uses linear-time wavelet
transforms and pointwise nonlinearities, significantly reducing inference cost.
This yields a compact, interpretable, and efficient alternative to neural
models. Our results support the viability of principled spectral learning in
both vision and language tasks, offering new directions for model design
without overparameterized architectures.

TL;DR: Deep learning models outperform traditional methods (ARIMA, ETS) in predicting Influenza A outbreaks, with Transformers showing the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive modeling for Influenza A outbreaks by comparing traditional and deep learning methods.

Method: Comparative analysis of ARIMA, ETS, and six deep learning architectures (Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, Transformer) using historical data (2009-2023).

Result: Deep learning models, especially Transformers, outperformed traditional methods with lower MSE and MAE.

Conclusion: Deep learning enhances infectious disease prediction, suggesting its integration into public health forecasting and surveillance systems.

Abstract: Influenza A is responsible for 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths a year,
though this estimate is an improvement from years past due to improvements in
sanitation, healthcare practices, and vaccination programs. In this study, we
perform a comparative analysis of traditional and deep learning models to
predict Influenza A outbreaks. Using historical data from January 2009 to
December 2023, we compared the performance of traditional ARIMA and Exponential
Smoothing(ETS) models with six distinct deep learning architectures: Simple
RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, BiGRU, and Transformer. The results reveal a clear
superiority of all the deep learning models, especially the state-of-the-art
Transformer with respective average testing MSE and MAE of 0.0433 \pm 0.0020
and 0.1126 \pm 0.0016 for capturing the temporal complexities associated with
Influenza A data, outperforming well known traditional baseline ARIMA and ETS
models. These findings of this study provide evidence that state-of-the-art
deep learning architectures can enhance predictive modeling for infectious
diseases and indicate a more general trend toward using deep learning methods
to enhance public health forecasting and intervention planning strategies.
Future work should focus on how these models can be incorporated into real-time
forecasting and preparedness systems at an epidemic level, and integrated into
existing surveillance systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate bicycle volume estimation is crucial for urban planning but hindered by sparse count data in global bicycling networks.

Method: BikeVAE-GNN integrates Hybrid-GNN (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE) with VAE to model spatial relationships and enrich graph structure, performing regression and classification tasks.

Result: Achieves MAE of 30.82 bicycles/day, 99% accuracy, and F1-score of 0.99 on Melbourne data with 99% sparsity.

Conclusion: BikeVAE-GNN advances sparse network bicycle volume estimation, offering insights for sustainable infrastructure.

Abstract: Accurate link-level bicycle volume estimation is essential for informed urban
and transport planning but it is challenged by extremely sparse count data in
urban bicycling networks worldwide. We propose BikeVAE-GNN, a novel dual-task
framework augmenting a Hybrid Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) to estimate Average Daily Bicycle (ADB) counts, addressing
sparse bicycle networks. The Hybrid-GNN combines Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE to effectively model
intricate spatial relationships in sparse networks while VAE generates
synthetic nodes and edges to enrich the graph structure and enhance the
estimation performance. BikeVAE-GNN simultaneously performs - regression for
bicycling volume estimation and classification for bicycling traffic level
categorization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BikeVAE-GNN using
OpenStreetMap data and publicly available bicycle count data within the City of
Melbourne - where only 141 of 15,933 road segments have labeled counts
(resulting in 99% count data sparsity). Our experiments show that BikeVAE-GNN
outperforms machine learning and baseline GNN models, achieving a mean absolute
error (MAE) of 30.82 bicycles per day, accuracy of 99% and F1-score of 0.99.
Ablation studies further validate the effective role of Hybrid-GNN and VAE
components. Our research advances bicycling volume estimation in sparse
networks using novel and state-of-the-art approaches, providing insights for
sustainable bicycling infrastructures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a GNN-based method for efficient subgraph matching in large-scale circuits, outperforming traditional and existing deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of rule-based and node-to-node matching methods, and inefficiencies in existing deep learning models for subgraph matching in EDA and circuit verification.

Method: Uses GNNs to predict high-probability regions for target circuits, constructs negative samples for accurate learning, and directly extracts global subgraph embeddings.

Result: Significantly improves time efficiency and target region prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable and effective solution for subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

Abstract: Subgraph matching plays an important role in electronic design automation
(EDA) and circuit verification. Traditional rule-based methods have limitations
in generalizing to arbitrary target circuits. Furthermore, node-to-node
matching approaches tend to be computationally inefficient, particularly for
large-scale circuits. Deep learning methods have emerged as a potential
solution to address these challenges, but existing models fail to efficiently
capture global subgraph embeddings or rely on inefficient matching matrices,
which limits their effectiveness for large circuits. In this paper, we propose
an efficient graph matching approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
to predict regions of high probability for containing the target circuit.
Specifically, we construct various negative samples to enable GNNs to
accurately learn the presence of target circuits and develop an approach to
directly extracting subgraph embeddings from the entire circuit, which captures
global subgraph information and addresses the inefficiency of applying GNNs to
all candidate subgraphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of time efficiency and
target region prediction, offering a scalable and effective solution for
subgraph matching in large-scale circuits.

*J. Poole,P. Gardner,A. J. Hughes,N. Dervilis,R. S. Mills,T. A. Dardeno,K. Worden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using the Modal Assurance Criterion (MAC) to select features for transfer learning in population-based SHM, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data and distribution differences between structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data for SHM is scarce and costly, and conventional ML methods fail to generalize across structures due to distribution differences. Transfer learning offers a solution, but selecting suitable source domains and features is challenging without domain expertise.

Method: Leverages physics knowledge and the MAC to quantify mode correspondence between healthy structures, selecting features with invariant conditional distributions. Validated through numerical and experimental case studies.

Result: MAC shows high correspondence with a supervised metric for joint-distribution similarity, indicating its effectiveness in selecting features for generalizable classifiers.

Conclusion: The MAC-based approach effectively selects features for transfer learning in SHM, demonstrating practicality in real-world applications.

Abstract: Data used for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are
expensive and often impractical to obtain, particularly labelled data.
Population-based SHM presents a potential solution to this issue by considering
the available data across a population of structures. However, differences
between structures will mean the training and testing distributions will
differ; thus, conventional machine learning methods cannot be expected to
generalise between structures. To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),
can be used to leverage information across related domains. An important
consideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based
metrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.
Thus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is
to identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for
which the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.
Generally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain
expertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on
the dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,
knowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal
assurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the
modes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with
a supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the
primary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The
MAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave
consistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with
invariance in the conditional distributions. This approach is demonstrated on
numerical and experimental case studies to verify its effectiveness in various
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual exoplanet discovery is slow and inefficient; ML offers a faster, scalable solution, but existing models are complex and resource-intensive.

Method: Tested logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest on NASA's Kepler dataset, using data augmentation to improve fairness and generalization.

Result: Initial results were promising, but data augmentation was crucial for enhancing recall and precision, though accuracy varied by model.

Conclusion: Simpler ML models, combined with data augmentation, can effectively improve exoplanet discovery, balancing performance and resource use.

Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers
discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive
time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only
5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning
(ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields,
capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its
accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by
large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex
algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in
this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known
ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models
that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict
is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show
promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset
imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further
ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes
that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques
significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for
each model.

*Aarush Gupta,Kendric Hsu,Syna Mathod*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs solve forward and inverse problems in differential equations by embedding prior analytical knowledge into the cost function, improving performance and handling sparse data without overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage prior knowledge (differential equations) in neural networks for solving complex problems efficiently, even with sparse data.

Method: Use Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to minimize residuals of differential equations, optimizing both network weights and model parameters simultaneously. Implemented in Python using PyTorch.

Result: PINNs effectively solve both forward and inverse problems, demonstrated with linear, quadratic, and complex equations like the heat equation.

Conclusion: PINNs are a robust tool for solving differential equations by integrating prior knowledge, offering improved performance and generalization.

Abstract: Mathematical models in neural networks are powerful tools for solving complex
differential equations and optimizing their parameters; that is, solving the
forward and inverse problems, respectively. A forward problem predicts the
output of a network for a given input by optimizing weights and biases. An
inverse problem finds equation parameters or coefficients that effectively
model the data. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can solve both
problems. PINNs inject prior analytical information about the data into the
cost function to improve model performance outside the training set boundaries.
This also allows PINNs to efficiently solve problems with sparse data without
overfitting by extrapolating the model to fit larger trends in the data. The
prior information we implement is in the form of differential equations.
Residuals are the differences between the left-hand and right-hand sides of
corresponding differential equations; PINNs minimize these residuals to
effectively solve the differential equation and take advantage of prior
knowledge. In this way, the solution and parameters are embedded into the loss
function and optimized, allowing both the weights of the neural network and the
model parameters to be found simultaneously, solving both the forward and
inverse problems in the process. In this paper, we will create PINNs with
residuals of varying complexity, beginning with linear and quadratic models and
then expanding to fit models for the heat equation and other complex
differential equations. We will mainly use Python as the computing language,
using the PyTorch library to aid us in our research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored application of language models (like GPT and BERT) in DNA sequence generation, focusing on biological property conditioning.

Method: ATGC-Gen uses cross-modal encoding with decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures for flexible training and generation. Tasks include promoter/enhancer design and protein binding specificity modeling.

Result: ATGC-Gen generates fluent, diverse, and biologically relevant sequences, showing improvements in controllability and functional relevance over prior methods.

Conclusion: Language models like ATGC-Gen hold promise for advancing programmable genomic design, with code publicly available.

Abstract: We consider controllable DNA sequence design, where sequences are generated
by conditioning on specific biological properties. While language models (LMs)
such as GPT and BERT have achieved remarkable success in natural language
generation, their application to DNA sequence generation remains largely
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ATGC-Gen, an Automated Transformer
Generator for Controllable Generation, which leverages cross-modal encoding to
integrate diverse biological signals. ATGC-Gen is instantiated with both
decoder-only and encoder-only transformer architectures, allowing flexible
training and generation under either autoregressive or masked recovery
objectives. We evaluate ATGC-Gen on representative tasks including promoter and
enhancer sequence design, and further introduce a new dataset based on ChIP-Seq
experiments for modeling protein binding specificity. Our experiments
demonstrate that ATGC-Gen can generate fluent, diverse, and biologically
relevant sequences aligned with the desired properties. Compared to prior
methods, our model achieves notable improvements in controllability and
functional relevance, highlighting the potential of language models in
advancing programmable genomic design. The source code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether KANs, with learnable activation functions on edges, outperform traditional AEs in medical signal tasks despite having fewer or equal parameters.

Method: Five classic AE tasks were tested using cardiological signals from the AbnormalHeartbeat dataset, comparing Linear, Convolutional, and Variational AEs against their KAN counterparts.

Result: The study evaluates performance differences between traditional AEs and KANs in medical signal processing tasks.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of KANs in enhancing AE performance for medical applications, suggesting further optimization and research.

Abstract: Deep learning neural networks architectures such Multi Layer Perceptrons
(MLP) and Convolutional blocks still play a crucial role in nowadays research
advancements. From a topological point of view, these architecture may be
represented as graphs in which we learn the functions related to the nodes
while fixed edges convey the information from the input to the output. A recent
work introduced a new architecture called Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KAN) that
reports how putting learnable activation functions on the edges of the neural
network leads to better performances in multiple scenarios. Multiple studies
are focusing on optimizing the KAN architecture by adding important features
such as dropout regularization, Autoencoders (AE), model benchmarking and last,
but not least, the KAN Convolutional Network (KCN) that introduced matrix
convolution with KANs learning. This study aims to benchmark multiple versions
of vanilla AEs (such as Linear, Convolutional and Variational) against their
Kolmogorov-Arnold counterparts that have same or less number of parameters.
Using cardiological signals as model input, a total of five different classic
AE tasks were studied: reconstruction, generation, denoising, inpainting and
anomaly detection. The proposed experiments uses a medical dataset
\textit{AbnormalHeartbeat} that contains audio signals obtained from the
stethoscope.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents promising
opportunities for automation and enhancement in Electronic Design Automation

capabilities and limitations. Extensive evaluations reveal significant
performance gaps among existing LLMs, particularly in back-end design and

TL;DR: STAG is a self-supervised framework that quantizes graph structural info into discrete tokens, enabling zero-shot transfer learning without labeled data, and achieves SOTA performance in node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in embedding graph structural info into LLM-compatible formats and reduce dependency on labeled data for transfer learning.

Method: Uses soft assignment and KL divergence guided quantization to tokenize graph structures, supporting LLM-based and traditional learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in node classification benchmarks and works with various LLM architectures.

Conclusion: STAG effectively bridges graph learning with LLMs, offering a flexible and high-performing solution.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation for
modeling complex relationships across diverse domains. With the rise of large
language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their
capabilities for graph learning. However, current approaches face significant
challenges in embedding structural information into LLM-compatible formats,
requiring either computationally expensive alignment mechanisms or manual graph
verbalization techniques that often lose critical structural details. Moreover,
these methods typically require labeled data from source domains for effective
transfer learning, significantly constraining their adaptability. We propose
STAG, a novel self-supervised framework that directly quantizes graph
structural information into discrete tokens using a frozen codebook. Unlike
traditional quantization approaches, our method employs soft assignment and KL
divergence guided quantization to address the unique challenges of graph data,
which lacks natural tokenization structures. Our framework enables both
LLM-based and traditional learning approaches, supporting true zero-shot
transfer learning without requiring labeled data even in the source domain.
Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple
node classification benchmarks while maintaining compatibility with different
LLM architectures, offering an elegant solution to bridging graph learning with
LLMs.

*Obumneme Nwafor,Mohammed Abdul Majeed Al Hooti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-based decision support system using meteorological data to predict maintenance risks for green hydrogen infrastructure in Oman's Duqm region, addressing the lack of historical operational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of historical maintenance and performance data for large-scale hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a knowledge gap for risk assessment in infrastructure planning and auctions.

Method: An AI decision support system is developed, leveraging publicly available meteorological data to create a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI) for assessing infrastructure risks.

Result: The proposed MPI tool predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands, aiding regulatory foresight and operational decision-making.

Conclusion: The AI tool enables temporal benchmarking and risk assessment for hydrogen infrastructure, filling the data void and enhancing auction evaluation criteria.

Abstract: As green hydrogen emerges as a major component of global decarbonisation,
Oman has positioned itself strategically through national auctions and
international partnerships. Following two successful green hydrogen project
rounds, the country launched its third auction (R3) in the Duqm region. While
this area exhibits relative geospatial homogeneity, it is still vulnerable to
environmental fluctuations that pose inherent risks to productivity. Despite
growing global investment in green hydrogen, operational data remains scarce,
with major projects like Saudi Arabia's NEOM facility not expected to commence
production until 2026, and Oman's ACME Duqm project scheduled for 2028. This
absence of historical maintenance and performance data from large-scale
hydrogen facilities in desert environments creates a major knowledge gap for
accurate risk assessment for infrastructure planning and auction decisions.
Given this data void, environmental conditions emerge as accessible and
reliable proxy for predicting infrastructure maintenance pressures, because
harsh desert conditions such as dust storms, extreme temperatures, and humidity
fluctuations are well-documented drivers of equipment degradation in renewable
energy systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an Artificial
Intelligence decision support system that leverages publicly available
meteorological data to develop a predictive Maintenance Pressure Index (MPI),
which predicts risk levels and future maintenance demands on hydrogen
infrastructure. This tool strengthens regulatory foresight and operational
decision-making by enabling temporal benchmarking to assess and validate
performance claims over time. It can be used to incorporate temporal risk
intelligence into auction evaluation criteria despite the absence of historical
operational benchmarks.

TL;DR: A comprehensive framework for BP prediction in ICUs addresses data leakage, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional validation, achieving clinically acceptable performance with limitations in hypotensive patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML approaches for BP monitoring lack external validation, uncertainty quantification, and data leakage prevention, necessitating a robust solution for critical care.

Method: The framework uses an ensemble of Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features, incorporating quantile regression for uncertainty and systematic leakage prevention.

Result: Internal validation met AAMI standards (SBP: R²=0.86, RMSE=6.03; DBP: R²=0.49, RMSE=7.13), but external validation degraded by 30%, especially in hypotensive cases. Uncertainty intervals were valid (80.3% SBP, 79.9% DBP coverage).

Conclusion: The framework sets realistic expectations for AI-assisted BP monitoring in ICUs, with publicly available code for deployment.

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) monitoring is critical in in tensive care units (ICUs)
where hemodynamic instability can
  rapidly progress to cardiovascular collapse. Current machine
  learning (ML) approaches suffer from three limitations: lack of
  external validation, absence of uncertainty quantification, and
  inadequate data leakage prevention. This study presents the
  first comprehensive framework with novel algorithmic leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification, and cross-institutional
  validation for electronic health records (EHRs) based BP pre dictions. Our
methodology implemented systematic data leakage
  prevention, uncertainty quantification through quantile regres sion, and
external validation between the MIMIC-III and eICU
  databases. An ensemble framework combines Gradient Boosting,
  Random Forest, and XGBoost with 74 features across five
  physiological domains. Internal validation achieved a clinically
  acceptable performance (for SBP: R^2 = 0.86, RMSE = 6.03
  mmHg; DBP: R^2 = 0.49, RMSE = 7.13 mmHg), meeting AAMI
  standards. External validation showed 30% degradation with
  critical limitations in patients with hypotensive. Uncertainty
  quantification generated valid prediction intervals (80.3% SBP
  and 79.9% DBP coverage), enabling risk-stratified protocols
  with narrow intervals (< 15 mmHg) for standard monitoring
  and wide intervals (> 30 mmHg) for manual verification. This
  framework provides realistic deployment expectations for cross institutional
AI-assisted BP monitoring in critical care settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational overhead of PLM fine-tuning and inflexibility of fixed prompts, alongside FL challenges like communication limits.

Method: Uses a dynamic prompt generator to create context-aware prompts, freezing PLM parameters and optimizing for federated learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in global model performance, reduces calculation time, and minimizes parameter transmission.

Conclusion: FedDPG effectively balances efficiency, flexibility, and privacy in federated learning for NLP tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various NLP tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning methods for leveraging
PLMs for downstream tasks entail significant computational overhead.
Prompt-tuning has emerged as an efficient alternative that involves prepending
a limited number of parameters to the input sequence and only updating them
while the PLM's parameters are frozen. However, this technique's prompts remain
fixed for all inputs, reducing the model's flexibility. The Federated Learning
(FL) technique has gained attention in recent years to address the growing
concerns around data privacy. However, challenges such as communication and
computation limitations of clients still need to be addressed. To mitigate
these challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator
(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate
context-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and
adaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.
Our experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG
outperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in
terms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the
calculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL
network.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven approach using graph neural networks and Wikipedia-based language models to efficiently design new metallic glasses and other materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional material synthesis is slow and expensive, especially for metallic glasses, due to the need for optimal multi-element combinations. Limited exploration of the material space and data scarcity hinder progress.

Method: The study uses graph neural networks with Wikipedia-derived node embeddings (from multiple languages) to model material relationships and recommend new candidates.

Result: The approach demonstrates potential for uncovering hidden material relationships and improving the design of amorphous materials.

Conclusion: This work introduces a novel AI-driven paradigm for material discovery, leveraging natural language embeddings and graph-based learning.

Abstract: Synthesizing new materials efficiently is highly demanded in various research
fields. However, this process is usually slow and expensive, especially for
metallic glasses, whose formation strongly depends on the optimal combinations
of multiple elements to resist crystallization. This constraint renders only
several thousands of candidates explored in the vast material space since 1960.
Recently, data-driven approaches armed by advanced machine learning techniques
provided alternative routes for intelligent materials design. Due to data
scarcity and immature material encoding, the conventional tabular data is
usually mined by statistical learning algorithms, giving limited model
predictability and generalizability. Here, we propose sophisticated data
learning from material network representations. The node elements are encoded
from the Wikipedia by a language model. Graph neural networks with versatile
architectures are designed to serve as recommendation systems to explore hidden
relationships among materials. By employing Wikipedia embeddings from different
languages, we assess the capability of natural languages in materials design.
Our study proposes a new paradigm to harvesting new amorphous materials and
beyond with artificial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reinforcement learning for control problems by adapting SwiftTD's optimizations to on-policy learning.

Method: Combines SwiftTD's step-size optimization and decay with True Online Sarsa(λ) to create Swift-Sarsa, tested on the operant conditioning benchmark.

Result: Swift-Sarsa successfully learns to differentiate relevant signals from noise without prior problem knowledge.

Conclusion: Swift-Sarsa enables scalable representation learning by efficiently handling noisy features, paving the way for broader applications.

Abstract: Javed, Sharifnassab, and Sutton (2024) introduced a new algorithm for TD
learning -- SwiftTD -- that augments True Online TD($\lambda$) with step-size
optimization, a bound on the effective learning rate, and step-size decay. In
their experiments SwiftTD outperformed True Online TD($\lambda$) and
TD($\lambda$) on a variety of prediction tasks derived from Atari games, and
its performance was robust to the choice of hyper-parameters. In this extended
abstract we extend SwiftTD to work for control problems. We combine the key
ideas behind SwiftTD with True Online Sarsa($\lambda$) to develop an on-policy
reinforcement learning algorithm called $\textit{Swift-Sarsa}$.
  We propose a simple benchmark for linear on-policy control called the
$\textit{operant conditioning benchmark}$. The key challenge in the operant
conditioning benchmark is that a very small subset of input signals are
relevant for decision making. The majority of the signals are noise sampled
from a non-stationary distribution. To learn effectively, the agent must learn
to differentiate between the relevant signals and the noisy signals, and
minimize prediction errors by assigning credit to the weight parameters
associated with the relevant signals.
  Swift-Sarsa, when applied to the operant conditioning benchmark, learned to
assign credit to the relevant signals without any prior knowledge of the
structure of the problem. It opens the door for solution methods that learn
representations by searching over hundreds of millions of features in parallel
without performance degradation due to noisy or bad features.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ablation therapies for persistent AF are often ineffective due to non-pulmonary vein drivers. This study aims to improve AF driver detection using unsupervised learning.

Method: Convolutional autoencoders were used for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar EGMs. The framework analyzed 11,404 acquisitions from 291 patients.

Result: The autoencoders preserved morphological features with low reconstruction loss. Downstream classifiers achieved AUCs of 0.73-0.76 for rotational/focal activity and 0.93 for EGM entanglement.

Conclusion: The method enables real-time integration into clinical systems, showcasing unsupervised learning's potential for meaningful feature extraction from intracardiac signals.

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained arrhythmia, yet
current ablation therapies, including pulmonary vein isolation, are frequently
ineffective in persistent AF due to the involvement of non-pulmonary vein
drivers. This study proposes a deep learning framework using convolutional
autoencoders for unsupervised feature extraction from unipolar and bipolar
intracavitary electrograms (EGMs) recorded during AF in ablation studies. These
latent representations of atrial electrical activity enable the
characterization and automation of EGM analysis, facilitating the detection of
AF drivers.
  The database consisted of 11,404 acquisitions recorded from 291 patients,
containing 228,080 unipolar EGMs and 171,060 bipolar EGMs. The autoencoders
successfully learned latent representations with low reconstruction loss,
preserving the morphological features. The extracted embeddings allowed
downstream classifiers to detect rotational and focal activity with moderate
performance (AUC 0.73-0.76) and achieved high discriminative performance in
identifying atrial EGM entanglement (AUC 0.93).
  The proposed method can operate in real-time and enables integration into
clinical electroanatomical mapping systems to assist in identifying
arrhythmogenic regions during ablation procedures. This work highlights the
potential of unsupervised learning to uncover physiologically meaningful
features from intracardiac signals.

Motivation: Machine Learning is power-intensive, prompting interest in alternative physical implementations for learning tasks.

Method: Introduces BEASTAL, a scheme where systems learn via local physical rules, controlled only by boundary parameters (inputs/outputs).

Result: Demonstrates autonomous learning for regression and classification, performing best with non-linear local rules.

Conclusion: BEASTAL advances physical learning by using intuitive local rules without complex architectures, suitable for linear tasks.

Abstract: Machine Learning, however popular and accessible, is computationally
intensive and highly power-consuming, prompting interest in alternative
physical implementations of learning tasks. We introduce a training scheme for
physical systems that minimize power dissipation in which only boundary
parameters (i.e. inputs and outputs) are externally controlled. Using this
scheme, these Boundary-Enabled Adaptive State Tuning Systems (BEASTS) learn by
exploiting local physical rules. Our scheme, BEASTAL (BEAST-Adaline), is the
closest analog of the Adaline algorithm for such systems. We demonstrate this
autonomous learning in silico for regression and classification tasks. Our
approach advances previous physical learning schemes by using intuitive, local
evolution rules without requiring large-scale memory or complex internal
architectures. BEASTAL can perform any linear task, achieving best performance
when the local evolution rule is non-linear.

Motivation: To address the challenge of efficiently computing Wasserstein barycenters of distributions without accessing local data or solving repeated mass transportation problems.

Method: Proposes a federated dual decomposition algorithm that uses highly aggregated information and avoids matrix-vector operations.

Result: The algorithm demonstrates low complexity per iteration, scalability, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in examples of mixture models.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient, scalable, and avoids data privacy concerns by not accessing local data directly.

Abstract: We propose an efficient federated dual decomposition algorithm for
calculating the Wasserstein barycenter of several distributions, including
choosing the support of the solution. The algorithm does not access local data
and uses only highly aggregated information. It also does not require repeated
solutions to mass transportation problems. Because of the absence of any
matrix-vector operations, the algorithm exhibits a very low complexity of each
iteration and significant scalability. We illustrate its virtues and compare it

Result: Preliminary results show significant TCO benefits, with some workloads performing similarly on mixed older and newer hardware.

Conclusion: Heterogeneous infrastructure can optimize costs and extend the life of deployed hardware, offering a viable alternative to homogeneous setups.

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a dominant workload in a wide range of
applications, promising to be the vehicle that delivers the promised benefits
of AI to enterprises and consumers. Unlike conventional software or static
inference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these
agents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal
data input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector
DB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,
we need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.
  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for
dynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute
infrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and
across different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers
several building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI
execution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and
bandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and
compilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular
operators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic
orchestration system that can place the granular components across a
heterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an
end-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and
preliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can
deliver significant TCO benefits. A preliminary surprising finding is that for
some workloads a heterogeneous combination of older generation GPUs with newer
accelerators can deliver similar TCO as the latest generation homogenous GPU
infrastructure design, potentially extending the life of deployed
infrastructure.

*Devroop Kar,Zimeng Lyu,Sheeraja Rajakrishnan,Hao Zhang,Alex Ororbia,Travis Desell,Daniel Krutz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes four novel loss functions for stock trading strategies, enabling neural networks to learn effective trading. The Crossformer model with these functions outperformed reinforcement learning methods, achieving high returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock trading is challenging due to market volatility. The goal is to develop better trading strategies using novel loss functions.

Method: Four new loss functions are introduced to train neural networks (e.g., transformers) for trading decisions. The Crossformer model is tested on S&P 500 stocks.

Result: The Crossformer model achieved returns of 51.42%, 51.04%, and 48.62% in 2021-2023, outperforming PPO and DDPG (max 41.58%).

Conclusion: The proposed loss functions enable effective trading strategies, with the Crossformer model consistently outperforming benchmarks.

Abstract: Stock trading has always been a challenging task due to the highly volatile
nature of the stock market. Making sound trading decisions to generate profit
is particularly difficult under such conditions. To address this, we propose
four novel loss functions to drive decision-making for a portfolio of stocks.
These functions account for the potential profits or losses based with respect
to buying or shorting respective stocks, enabling potentially any artificial
neural network to directly learn an effective trading strategy. Despite the
high volatility in stock market fluctuations over time, training time-series
models such as transformers on these loss functions resulted in trading
strategies that generated significant profits on a portfolio of 50 different
S&P 500 company stocks as compared to a benchmark reinforcment learning
techniques and a baseline buy and hold method. As an example, using 2021, 2022
and 2023 as three test periods, the Crossformer model adapted with our best
loss function was most consistent, resulting in returns of 51.42%, 51.04% and
48.62% respectively. In comparison, the best performing state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning methods, PPO and DDPG, only delivered maximum profits of
around 41%, 2.81% and 41.58% for the same periods. The code is available at

*Niclas Alexander Göring,Charles London,Abdurrahman Hadi Erturk,Chris Mingard,Yoonsoo Nam,Ard A. Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural networks outperform kernel methods due to feature learning, but current theories focus on feature learning strength, not quality, limiting understanding of generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why neural networks outperform kernel methods and to evaluate the quality of learned features.

Method: Introduces 'feature quality' to measure performance improvement and examines existing feature learning theories empirically.

Result: Current theories assess feature learning strength, not feature quality, failing to explain neural network generalization.

Conclusion: Existing theories are insufficient for developing a theory of neural network generalization; focus on feature quality is needed.

Abstract: Neural networks outperform kernel methods, sometimes by orders of magnitude,
e.g. on staircase functions. This advantage stems from the ability of neural
networks to learn features, adapting their hidden representations to better
capture the data. We introduce a concept we call feature quality to measure
this performance improvement. We examine existing theories of feature learning
and demonstrate empirically that they primarily assess the strength of feature
learning, rather than the quality of the learned features themselves.
Consequently, current theories of feature learning do not provide a sufficient
foundation for developing theories of neural network generalization.

*Bermet Burkanova,Payam Jome Yazdian,Chuxuan Zhang,Trinity Evans,Paige Tuttösí,Angelica Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoMPAS3D is a large, diverse salsa dance motion capture dataset for interactive humanoid AI, featuring expert annotations and benchmarking tasks for leader-follower and duet generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human communication extends beyond text to embodied movement, yet AI lacks models for such coupled, reactive interactions. Partner dance serves as a rich testbed for expressive, interactive AI.

Method: The paper introduces CoMPAS3D, a dataset of 3 hours of salsa dances by 18 dancers of varying skill levels, with fine-grained annotations. It benchmarks tasks like leader-follower generation and duet synthesis.

Result: The dataset includes 2,800 annotated move segments and a multitask SalsaAgent model for benchmark tasks, advancing research in interactive embodied AI.

Conclusion: CoMPAS3D and the SalsaAgent model provide tools for studying socially interactive AI and expressive humanoid motion, aiming for human-partner dance.

Abstract: Imagine a humanoid that can safely and creatively dance with a human,
adapting to its partner's proficiency, using haptic signaling as a primary form
of communication. While today's AI systems excel at text or voice-based
interaction with large language models, human communication extends far beyond
text-it includes embodied movement, timing, and physical coordination. Modeling
coupled interaction between two agents poses a formidable challenge: it is
continuous, bidirectionally reactive, and shaped by individual variation. We
present CoMPAS3D, the largest and most diverse motion capture dataset of
improvised salsa dancing, designed as a challenging testbed for interactive,
expressive humanoid AI. The dataset includes 3 hours of leader-follower salsa
dances performed by 18 dancers spanning beginner, intermediate, and
professional skill levels. For the first time, we provide fine-grained salsa
expert annotations, covering over 2,800 move segments, including move types,
combinations, execution errors and stylistic elements. We draw analogies
between partner dance communication and natural language, evaluating CoMPAS3D
on two benchmark tasks for synthetic humans that parallel key problems in
spoken language and dialogue processing: leader or follower generation with
proficiency levels (speaker or listener synthesis), and duet (conversation)
generation. Towards a long-term goal of partner dance with humans, we release
the dataset, annotations, and code, along with a multitask SalsaAgent model
capable of performing all benchmark tasks, alongside additional baselines to
encourage research in socially interactive embodied AI and creative, expressive
humanoid motion generation.

*Robert Frenken,Sidra Ghayour Bhatti,Hanqin Zhang,Qadeer Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KD-GAT, a CAN intrusion detection framework using GATs and knowledge distillation, improves accuracy and reduces complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The CAN protocol lacks security, making it vulnerable to attacks.

Method: Uses GATs with knowledge distillation; teacher model is a multi-layer GAT, student model is compact (6.32% size).

Result: High accuracy (99.97% and 99.31%) on two datasets, but performance drops on imbalanced data.

Conclusion: Effective framework, but class imbalance needs addressing for broader applicability.

Abstract: The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is widely adopted for in-vehicle
communication but lacks inherent security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to
cyberattacks. This paper introduces KD-GAT, an intrusion detection framework
that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with knowledge distillation (KD)
to enhance detection accuracy while reducing computational complexity. In our
approach, CAN traffic is represented as graphs using a sliding window to
capture temporal and relational patterns. A multi-layer GAT with jumping
knowledge aggregation acting as the teacher model, while a compact student
GAT--only 6.32% the size of the teacher--is trained via a two-phase process
involving supervised pretraining and knowledge distillation with both soft and
hard label supervision. Experiments on three benchmark datasets--Car-Hacking,
Car-Survival, and can-train-and-test demonstrate that both teacher and student
models achieve strong results, with the student model attaining 99.97% and
99.31% accuracy on Car-Hacking and Car-Survival, respectively. However,
significant class imbalance in can-train-and-test has led to reduced
performance for both models on this dataset. Addressing this imbalance remains
an important direction for future work.

*Yazeed Alrubyli,Omar Alomeir,Abrar Wafa,Diána Hidvégi,Hend Alrasheed,Mohsen Bahrami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a graph neural network that uses business taxonomy to predict co-visitation patterns, outperforming traditional spatial models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting co-visitation patterns is vital for urban planning and retail analytics, but existing methods fail due to data sparsity and lack of business semantics.

Method: The proposed method integrates business taxonomy (NAICS codes) with spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in a scalable graph neural network.

Result: The model achieves a 157% improvement in R-squared (0.243 to 0.625) and 32% better ranking quality (NDCG at 10) on a large dataset.

Conclusion: Incorporating business semantics significantly enhances co-visitation prediction, offering practical benefits for urban and retail applications.

Abstract: Understanding where people go after visiting one business is crucial for
urban planning, retail analytics, and location-based services. However,
predicting these co-visitation patterns across millions of venues remains
challenging due to extreme data sparsity and the complex interplay between
spatial proximity and business relationships. Traditional approaches using only
geographic distance fail to capture why coffee shops attract different customer
flows than fine dining restaurants, even when co-located. We introduce
NAICS-aware GraphSAGE, a novel graph neural network that integrates business
taxonomy knowledge through learnable embeddings to predict population-scale
co-visitation patterns. Our key insight is that business semantics, captured
through detailed industry codes, provide crucial signals that pure spatial
models cannot explain. The approach scales to massive datasets (4.2 billion
potential venue pairs) through efficient state-wise decomposition while
combining spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic features in an end-to-end
framework. Evaluated on our POI-Graph dataset comprising 94.9 million
co-visitation records across 92,486 brands and 48 US states, our method
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines: the
R-squared value increases from 0.243 to 0.625 (a 157 percent improvement), with
strong gains in ranking quality (32 percent improvement in NDCG at 10).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets using disjoint generative models, enhancing privacy with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve privacy in synthetic data generation by partitioning datasets into disjoint subsets for separate generative models, eliminating the need for common identifiers.

Method: Partition datasets into disjoint subsets, apply separate generative models, and combine results post hoc without common variables.

Result: Demonstrated success in case studies on tabular data, showing increased privacy with low utility cost, effectiveness for certain models, and potential for mixed-model synthesis.

Conclusion: Disjoint generative models offer a viable solution for privacy-preserving synthetic data generation with minimal trade-offs in utility.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for generating cross-sectional synthetic datasets
via disjoint generative models. In this paradigm, a dataset is partitioned into
disjoint subsets that are supplied to separate instances of generative models.
The results are then combined post hoc by a joining operation that works in the
absence of common variables/identifiers. The success of the framework is
demonstrated through several case studies and examples on tabular data that
helps illuminate some of the design choices that one may make. The principal
benefit of disjoint generative models is significantly increased privacy at
only a low utility cost. Additional findings include increased effectiveness
and feasibility for certain model types and the possibility for mixed-model
synthesis.

### [333] [Beyond Nearest Neighbors: Semantic Compression and Graph-Augmented Retrieval for Enhanced Vector Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19715)
*Rahul Raja,Arpita Vats*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces semantic compression, a new retrieval paradigm for vector databases that prioritizes diversity and semantic coverage over traditional top-k nearest neighbor search. It leverages submodular optimization and graph structures to enhance retrieval quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ANN search often produces redundant results lacking diversity, which is insufficient for applications like RAG, multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented agents. The paper aims to address this by focusing on semantic richness.

Method: The authors propose semantic compression, formalized using submodular optimization and information geometry, and implement graph-augmented vector retrieval to enable multi-hop, context-aware search.

Result: The approach improves semantic coverage and diversity in retrieval, addressing limitations of proximity-based methods in high-dimensional spaces.

Conclusion: The work lays a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, advocating for hybrid indexing and structured semantic retrieval, with publicly available implementation for further research.

Abstract: Vector databases typically rely on approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search
to retrieve the top-k closest vectors to a query in embedding space. While
effective, this approach often yields semantically redundant results, missing
the diversity and contextual richness required by applications such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-hop QA, and memory-augmented
agents. We introduce a new retrieval paradigm: semantic compression, which aims
to select a compact, representative set of vectors that captures the broader
semantic structure around a query. We formalize this objective using principles
from submodular optimization and information geometry, and show that it
generalizes traditional top-k retrieval by prioritizing coverage and diversity.
To operationalize this idea, we propose graph-augmented vector retrieval, which
overlays semantic graphs (e.g., kNN or knowledge-based links) atop vector
spaces to enable multi-hop, context-aware search. We theoretically analyze the
limitations of proximity-based retrieval under high-dimensional concentration
and highlight how graph structures can improve semantic coverage. Our work
outlines a foundation for meaning-centric vector search systems, emphasizing
hybrid indexing, diversity-aware querying, and structured semantic retrieval.
We make our implementation publicly available to foster future research in this
area.

*Yinzhou Tang,Huandong Wang,Xiaochen Fan,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DisasterMobLLM is a framework for predicting human mobility in disaster scenarios, improving accuracy by 32.8% (Acc@1) and 35.0% (F1-score) over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urbanization and climate change increase city vulnerability to disasters, necessitating better mobility prediction for early warnings and resource allocation. Existing models fail in disaster scenarios due to shifted mobility patterns.

Method: The framework integrates LLMs to model mobility intentions and transfer disaster knowledge between cities. It includes an intention predictor, refiner, and location predictor.

Result: Achieves 32.8% improvement in Acc@1 and 35.0% in F1-score for immobility prediction.

Conclusion: DisasterMobLLM effectively addresses the gap in disaster mobility prediction, offering significant performance improvements.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cities to natural disasters has increased with
urbanization and climate change, making it more important to predict human
mobility in the disaster scenarios for downstream tasks including
location-based early disaster warning and pre-allocating rescue resources, etc.
However, existing human mobility prediction models are mainly designed for
normal scenarios, and fail to adapt to disaster scenarios due to the shift of
human mobility patterns under disaster. To address this issue, we introduce
\textbf{DisasterMobLLM}, a mobility prediction framework for disaster scenarios
that can be integrated into existing deep mobility prediction methods by
leveraging LLMs to model the mobility intention and transferring the common
knowledge of how different disasters affect mobility intentions between cities.
This framework utilizes a RAG-Enhanced Intention Predictor to forecast the next
intention, refines it with an LLM-based Intention Refiner, and then maps the
intention to an exact location using an Intention-Modulated Location Predictor.
Extensive experiments illustrate that DisasterMobLLM can achieve a 32.8\%
improvement in terms of Acc@1 and a 35.0\% improvement in terms of the F1-score
of predicting immobility compared to the baselines. The code is available at
https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/DisasterMobLLM.

TL;DR: A curated dataset and a novel deep learning framework, Segment Transformer, are introduced to predict enzyme temperature stability, achieving state-of-the-art performance and experimentally validated improvements in enzyme engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental determination of enzyme thermal stability is labor-intensive and costly, while existing computational methods face data limitations.

Method: A curated dataset is developed, and the Segment Transformer, a deep learning model, is used to predict enzyme temperature stability by leveraging segment-level representations.

Result: The model achieves RMSE of 24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson/Spearman correlations of 0.33. Experimental validation shows a 1.64-fold improvement in enzyme activity with 17 mutations.

Conclusion: The Segment Transformer effectively predicts enzyme thermal stability and guides enzyme engineering, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: Developing enzymes with desired thermal properties is crucial for a wide
range of industrial and research applications, and determining temperature
stability is an essential step in this process. Experimental determination of
thermal parameters is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and costly. Moreover,
existing computational approaches are often hindered by limited data
availability and imbalanced distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce a curated temperature stability dataset designed for model
development and benchmarking in enzyme thermal modeling. Leveraging this
dataset, we present the \textit{Segment Transformer}, a novel deep learning
framework that enables efficient and accurate prediction of enzyme temperature
stability. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of
24.03, MAE of 18.09, and Pearson and Spearman correlations of 0.33,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating
segment-level representations, grounded in the biological observation that
different regions of a protein sequence contribute unequally to thermal
behavior. As a proof of concept, we applied the Segment Transformer to guide
the engineering of a cutinase enzyme. Experimental validation demonstrated a
1.64-fold improvement in relative activity following heat treatment, achieved
through only 17 mutations and without compromising catalytic function.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative AI method using LLM and RAG automates structural drawing creation from natural language descriptions, reducing manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural drawings are labor-intensive to create manually, despite being essential in engineering fields. Automating this process can save time and reduce workload.

Method: The approach uses a large language model (LLM) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to interpret natural language descriptions and generate AutoCAD-compatible structural drawings.

Result: The method successfully converts natural language descriptions into accurate structural drawings, streamlining the design process.

Conclusion: This AI-based method significantly reduces manual effort in structural drawing creation, enhancing efficiency and simplifying design iteration.

Abstract: Structural drawings are widely used in many fields, e.g., mechanical
engineering, civil engineering, etc. In civil engineering, structural drawings
serve as the main communication tool between architects, engineers, and
builders to avoid conflicts, act as legal documentation, and provide a
reference for future maintenance or evaluation needs. They are often organized
using key elements such as title/subtitle blocks, scales, plan views, elevation
view, sections, and detailed sections, which are annotated with standardized
symbols and line types for interpretation by engineers and contractors. Despite
advances in software capabilities, the task of generating a structural drawing
remains labor-intensive and time-consuming for structural engineers. Here we
introduce a novel generative AI-based method for generating structural drawings
employing a large language model (LLM) agent. The method incorporates a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique using externally-sourced facts
to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the language model. This method is
capable of understanding varied natural language descriptions, processing these
to extract necessary information, and generating code to produce the desired
structural drawing in AutoCAD. The approach developed, demonstrated and
evaluated herein enables the efficient and direct conversion of a structural
drawing's natural language description into an AutoCAD drawing, significantly
reducing the workload compared to current working process associated with
manual drawing production, facilitating the typical iterative process of
engineers for expressing design ideas in a simplified way.

Motivation: Current clinical tools for predicting bladder cancer recurrence are outdated and unreliable, especially for intermediate-risk cases.

Method: The study employs the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a symbolic learner, tested on the PHOTO trial dataset (n=330).

Result: TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, surpassing XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42).

Conclusion: TM provides accurate, transparent predictions, making it a trustworthy decision-support tool for real-world clinical use.

Abstract: Bladder cancer claims one life every 3 minutes worldwide. Most patients are
diagnosed with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), yet up to 70% recur
after treatment, triggering a relentless cycle of surgeries, monitoring, and
risk of progression. Clinical tools like the EORTC risk tables are outdated and
unreliable - especially for intermediate-risk cases.
  We propose an interpretable AI model using the Tsetlin Machine (TM), a
symbolic learner that outputs transparent, human-readable logic. Tested on the
PHOTO trial dataset (n=330), TM achieved an F1-score of 0.80, outperforming
XGBoost (0.78), Logistic Regression (0.60), and EORTC (0.42). TM reveals the
exact clauses behind each prediction, grounded in clinical features like tumour
count, surgeon experience, and hospital stay - offering accuracy and full
transparency. This makes TM a powerful, trustworthy decision-support tool ready
for real-world adoption.

TL;DR: Vanilla FL's performance is more affected by local optimizers and learning rates than by FL methods, with local training epochs' impact varying by method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of edge device configurations on FL performance in medical imaging, given its sensitivity to local factors.

Method: Benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology and blood cell classification tasks, analyzing the effects of local optimizers, learning rates, and training epochs.

Result: Local optimizer and learning rate choices impact performance more than FL methods. Local training epochs' effect on convergence varies by method.

Conclusion: Edge-specific configurations are more critical than algorithmic complexity for effective FL.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning method that enables
decentralized model training while preserving data privacy. Despite its promise
in medical imaging, recent FL methods are often sensitive to local factors such
as optimizers and learning rates, limiting their robustness in practical
deployments. In this work, we revisit vanilla FL to clarify the impact of edge
device configurations, benchmarking recent FL methods on colorectal pathology
and blood cell classification task. We numerically show that the choice of
local optimizer and learning rate has a greater effect on performance than the
specific FL method. Moreover, we find that increasing local training epochs can
either enhance or impair convergence, depending on the FL method. These
findings indicate that appropriate edge-specific configuration is more crucial
than algorithmic complexity for achieving effective FL.

*Tiantian Peng,Yuyang Liu,Shuo Yang,Qiuhe Hong,YongHong Tian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNSP is a continual learning method for CLIP that prevents catastrophic forgetting by projecting gradients onto the null space of prior knowledge, preserving zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's zero-shot performance degrades during fine-tuning due to catastrophic forgetting and embedding misalignment.

Method: Proposes Gradient Null Space Projection (GNSP) and combines it with knowledge distillation and modality alignment preservation loss.

Result: Achieves SOTA on MTIL benchmark (11 tasks) and maintains CLIP's modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance.

Conclusion: GNSP effectively preserves CLIP's robustness and generalization in continual learning.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
generalization by aligning visual and textual modalities in a shared embedding
space. However, when continuously fine-tuned on diverse tasks, CLIP suffers
from catastrophic forgetting and degradation of its embedding alignment,
undermining its zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we propose Gradient Null
Space Projection (GNSP), an efficient continual learning method that projects
task-specific gradients onto the null space of previously learned knowledge.
This orthogonal projection mathematically prevents interference with previous
tasks without relying on rehearsal or architectural modification. Furthermore,
to preserve the inherent generalization property of CLIP, we introduce
knowledge distillation and combine it with a modality alignment preservation
loss inspired by CLIP pre-training to stabilize the structure of the multimodal
embedding space during fine-tuning. On the MTIL benchmark consisting of 11
tasks, our method achieved SOTA performance on both the Average and Last key
metrics. More importantly, experiments show that our method successfully
maintains the original modality gap and cross-modal retrieval performance of
CLIP, confirming its effectiveness in maintaining a robust visual-language
space throughout the continual learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model for coordinating prosumers in local energy markets using reinforcement learning and adversarial pricing strategies, showing financial losses for some prosumers but improved fairness in larger markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coordinating prosumers with diverse energy resources in dynamic local energy markets and explore the impact of adversarial pricing.

Method: Uses a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework for real-time decision-making and a VAE-GAN model for adversarial price manipulation.

Result: Prosumers, especially those without generation capabilities, suffer financial losses under adversarial pricing, but larger markets stabilize trading and improve fairness.

Conclusion: The model effectively coordinates prosumers and reveals vulnerabilities to adversarial pricing, with market size influencing fairness and cooperation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a model for coordinating prosumers with heterogeneous
distributed energy resources (DERs), participating in the local energy market
(LEM) that interacts with the market-clearing entity. The proposed LEM scheme
utilizes a data-driven, model-free reinforcement learning approach based on the
multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework, enabling
prosumers to make real-time decisions on whether to buy, sell, or refrain from
any action while facilitating efficient coordination for optimal energy trading
in a dynamic market. In addition, we investigate a price manipulation strategy
using a variational auto encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN)
model, which allows utilities to adjust price signals in a way that induces
financial losses for the prosumers. Our results show that under adversarial
pricing, heterogeneous prosumer groups, particularly those lacking generation
capabilities, incur financial losses. The same outcome holds across LEMs of
different sizes. As the market size increases, trading stabilizes and fairness
improves through emergent cooperation among agents.

*Harish S,Chetana K Nayak,Joy Bose*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ML-driven solution using clustering, supervised learning, and NLP to resolve telecom problem tickets, addressing challenges like data drift and missing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve incident resolution in telecom billing systems by leveraging historical data patterns despite challenges like data drift and incomplete data.

Method: Uses clustering, supervised learning (LDA, Siamese networks, One-shot learning), and NLP techniques (index embedding) for resolution prediction.

Result: High prediction accuracy demonstrated on both open-source and proprietary telecom datasets.

Conclusion: The solution effectively tackles ticket resolution challenges and is deployed in a Kubernetes-based production environment with a real-time dashboard.

Abstract: Resolution of incidents or problem tickets is a common theme in service
industries in any sector, including billing and charging systems in telecom
domain. Machine learning can help to identify patterns and suggest resolutions
for the problem tickets, based on patterns in the historical data of the
tickets. However, this process may be complicated due to a variety of phenomena
such as data drift and issues such as missing data, lack of data pertaining to
resolutions of past incidents, too many similar sounding resolutions due to
free text and similar sounding text. This paper proposes a robust ML-driven
solution employing clustering, supervised learning, and advanced NLP models to
tackle these challenges effectively. Building on previous work, we demonstrate
clustering-based resolution identification, supervised classification with LDA,
Siamese networks, and One-shot learning, Index embedding. Additionally, we
present a real-time dashboard and a highly available Kubernetes-based
production deployment. Our experiments with both the open-source Bitext
customer-support dataset and proprietary telecom datasets demonstrate high
prediction accuracy.

TL;DR: ARPO, a novel RL algorithm, improves multi-turn tool interactions in LLMs by dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation, outperforming existing methods with half the tool-use budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL algorithms fail to balance LLMs' long-horizon reasoning and multi-turn tool interactions, necessitating a better approach.

Method: ARPO uses an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism and advantage attribution to optimize stepwise tool interactions.

Result: ARPO outperforms trajectory-level RL algorithms across 13 benchmarks, achieving better performance with reduced tool-use budget.

Conclusion: ARPO offers a scalable solution for aligning LLM-based agents with dynamic environments, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Large-scale reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has
demonstrated its effectiveness in harnessing the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for single-turn reasoning tasks. In realistic reasoning
scenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving
processes. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'
intrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in
multi-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced
Policy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training
multi-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that
LLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in
the entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following
interactions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO
incorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing
global trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting
exploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an
advantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage
differences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13
challenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and
deep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL
algorithms. Remarkably, ARPO achieves improved performance using only half of
the tool-use budget required by existing methods, offering a scalable solution
for aligning LLM-based agents with real-time dynamic environments. Our code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/dongguanting/ARPO

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CWMI embeds causal physics in LLMs using a Causal Physics Module and Causal Intervention Loss, improving zero-shot physical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, limiting real-world causal reasoning.

Method: Introduces CWMI with a Causal Physics Module and Causal Intervention Loss to learn cause-and-effect from multimodal data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning tasks like PIQA and PhysiCa-Bench.

Conclusion: Inducing a causal world model enhances reliability and generalizability of AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their advanced linguistic capabilities,
fundamentally lack an intuitive understanding of physical dynamics, which
limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios that require causal
reasoning. In this paper, we introduce Causal World Model Induction (CWMI), a
novel framework designed to embed an explicit model of causal physics within an
LLM. Our approach incorporates a dedicated Causal Physics Module (CPM) and a
new training objective called Causal Intervention Loss, encouraging the model
to learn cause-and-effect relationships from multimodal data. By training the
model to predict the outcomes of hypothetical interventions instead of merely
capturing statistical correlations, CWMI develops a robust internal
representation of physical laws. Experimental results show that CWMI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs on zero-shot physical reasoning
tasks, including the PIQA benchmark and our newly proposed PhysiCa-Bench
dataset. These findings demonstrate that inducing a causal world model is a
critical step toward more reliable and generalizable AI systems.

*Björn Kischelewski,Benjamin Guedj,David Wahl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RestoreAI uses AI to predict landmine risk from spatial patterns, improving clearance efficiency with linear, curved, and Bayesian methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI methods for landmine detection lack focus on spatial pattern-based risk prediction, which could enhance clearance efficiency.

Method: RestoreAI implements three deminers: linear (PCA-based), curved (principal curves), and Bayesian (incorporating expert knowledge).

Result: RestoreAI increased cleared landmines by 14.37 percentage points and reduced time by 24.45% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Pattern-based risk prediction, especially linear methods, significantly improves landmine clearance efficiency.

Abstract: Landmine removal is a slow, resource-intensive process affecting over 60
countries. While AI has been proposed to enhance explosive ordnance (EO)
detection, existing methods primarily focus on object recognition, with limited
attention to prediction of landmine risk based on spatial pattern information.
This work aims to answer the following research question: How can AI be used to
predict landmine risk from landmine patterns to improve clearance time
efficiency? To that effect, we introduce RestoreAI, an AI system for
pattern-based risk estimation of remaining explosives. RestoreAI is the first
AI system that leverages landmine patterns for risk prediction, improving the
accuracy of estimating the residual risk of missing EO prior to land release.
We particularly focus on the implementation of three instances of RestoreAI,
respectively, linear, curved and Bayesian pattern deminers. First, the linear
pattern deminer uses linear landmine patterns from a principal component
analysis (PCA) for the landmine risk prediction. Second, the curved pattern
deminer uses curved landmine patterns from principal curves. Finally, the
Bayesian pattern deminer incorporates prior expert knowledge by using a
Bayesian pattern risk prediction. Evaluated on real-world landmine data,
RestoreAI significantly boosts clearance efficiency. The top-performing
pattern-based deminers achieved a 14.37 percentage point increase in the
average share of cleared landmines per timestep and required 24.45% less time
than the best baseline deminer to locate all landmines. Interestingly, linear
and curved pattern deminers showed no significant performance difference,
suggesting that more efficient linear patterns are a viable option for risk
prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLoRA applies Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to continual learning, reducing computational demands while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiency of retraining entire models in continual learning for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Uses Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a small set of parameters across tasks, avoiding full retraining.

Result: Achieves performance on par or better than baselines while significantly reducing hardware requirements.

Conclusion: CLoRA is a resource-efficient solution for continual learning in constrained environments.

Abstract: In the past, continual learning (CL) was mostly concerned with the problem of
catastrophic forgetting in neural networks, that arises when incrementally
learning a sequence of tasks. Current CL methods function within the confines
of limited data access, without any restrictions imposed on computational
resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the latter takes precedence as
deployed systems are often computationally constrained. A major drawback of
most CL methods is the need to retrain the entire model for each new task. The
computational demands of retraining large models can be prohibitive, limiting
the applicability of CL in environments with limited resources. Through CLoRA,
we explore the applicability of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for class-incremental semantic
segmentation. CLoRA leverages a small set of parameters of the model and uses
the same set for learning across all tasks. Results demonstrate the efficacy of
CLoRA, achieving performance on par with and exceeding the baseline methods. We
further evaluate CLoRA using NetScore, underscoring the need to factor in
resource efficiency and evaluate CL methods beyond task performance. CLoRA
significantly reduces the hardware requirements for training, making it
well-suited for CL in resource-constrained environments after deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy concerns in generative models and unify the fragmented research on GenMU for systematic progress.

Method: Comprehensive review of GenMU research, proposing a unified framework for categorizing objectives, strategies, and metrics, and exploring connections with related techniques.

Result: A structured framework for GenMU, highlighting practical applications and identifying key challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: The paper lays a foundation for advancing GenMU research, offering a unified approach and open-source resources for further development.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, associated privacy concerns
have attracted growing attention. To address this, researchers have begun
adapting machine unlearning techniques from traditional classification models
to generative settings. Although notable progress has been made in this area, a
unified framework for systematically organizing and integrating existing work
is still lacking. The substantial differences among current studies in terms of
unlearning objectives and evaluation protocols hinder the objective and fair
comparison of various approaches. While some studies focus on specific types of
generative models, they often overlook the commonalities and systematic
characteristics inherent in Generative Model Unlearning (GenMU). To bridge this
gap, we provide a comprehensive review of current research on GenMU and propose
a unified analytical framework for categorizing unlearning objectives,
methodological strategies, and evaluation metrics. In addition, we explore the
connections between GenMU and related techniques, including model editing,
reinforcement learning from human feedback, and controllable generation. We
further highlight the potential practical value of unlearning techniques in
real-world applications. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future
research directions aimed at laying a solid foundation for further advancements
in this field. We consistently maintain the related open-source materials at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) in federated GNNs, revealing privacy risks in node classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unique privacy threat of sample-to-client attribution in federated GNNs, a finer-grained risk compared to centralized settings.

Method: A general attack framework exploiting FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding proximity to link samples to their source clients.

Result: High performance on membership inference and ownership identification across multiple datasets under realistic FL setups.

Conclusion: The study highlights client identity leakage as a new privacy threat in federated graph learning, calling for attribution-robust GNN designs.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many real-world applications, including
social networks, financial systems, and molecular biology. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have become the de facto standard for learning from such data
due to their strong representation capabilities. As GNNs are increasingly
deployed in federated learning (FL) settings to preserve data locality and
privacy, new privacy threats arise from the interaction between graph
structures and decentralized training. In this paper, we present the first
systematic study of cross-client membership inference attacks (CC-MIA) against
node classification tasks of federated GNNs (FedGNNs), where a malicious client
aims to infer which client owns the given data. Unlike prior
centralized-focused work that focuses on whether a sample was included in
training, our attack targets sample-to-client attribution, a finer-grained
privacy risk unique to federated settings. We design a general attack framework
that exploits FedGNNs' aggregation behaviors, gradient updates, and embedding
proximity to link samples to their source clients across training rounds. We
evaluate our attack across multiple graph datasets under realistic FL setups.
Results show that our method achieves high performance on both membership
inference and ownership identification. Our findings highlight a new privacy
threat in federated graph learning-client identity leakage through structural
and model-level cues, motivating the need for attribution-robust GNN design.

*Yue Hu,Zanxia Cao,Yingchao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEO is a novel first-order optimization method inspired by the Dimer technique from molecular dynamics. It estimates curvature without full Hessian computation, helping escape saddle points and flat regions in neural network training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First-order methods like SGD and Adam struggle with complex loss landscapes (e.g., flat regions, saddle points). Second-order methods are computationally expensive. DEO aims to bridge this gap by efficiently estimating curvature using gradient information.

Method: DEO adapts the Dimer method to approximate the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without full computation. It projects gradients orthogonally to the minimum curvature direction, guiding optimization away from problematic regions.

Result: Preliminary experiments on a Transformer model show DEO performs competitively with standard first-order methods, improving navigation of complex loss landscapes.

Conclusion: DEO successfully repurposes physics-inspired curvature estimation to enhance neural network training, offering a computationally feasible alternative to second-order methods.

Abstract: First-order optimization methods, such as SGD and Adam, are widely used for
training large-scale deep neural networks due to their computational efficiency
and robust performance. However, relying solely on gradient information, these
methods often struggle to navigate complex loss landscapes with flat regions,
plateaus, and saddle points. Second-order methods, which use curvature
information from the Hessian matrix, can address these challenges but are
computationally infeasible for large models. The Dimer method, a first-order
technique that constructs two closely spaced points to probe the local geometry
of a potential energy surface, efficiently estimates curvature using only
gradient information. Inspired by its use in molecular dynamics simulations for
locating saddle points, we propose Dimer-Enhanced Optimization (DEO), a novel
framework to escape saddle points in neural network training. DEO adapts the
Dimer method to explore a broader region of the loss landscape, approximating
the Hessian's smallest eigenvector without computing the full matrix. By
periodically projecting the gradient onto the subspace orthogonal to the
minimum curvature direction, DEO guides the optimizer away from saddle points
and flat regions, enhancing training efficiency with non-stepwise updates.
Preliminary experiments on a Transformer toy model show DEO achieves
competitive performance compared to standard first-order methods, improving
navigation of complex loss landscapes. Our work repurposes physics-inspired,
first-order curvature estimation to enhance neural network training in
high-dimensional spaces.

analyzed to assess the impact of data quality on model performance. The study
evaluated the models along multiple axes, including predictive accuracy,
calibration, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, and
feature sensitivity. We also explore pre-processing strategies, including KNN
imputation, Gaussian noise injection, and autoencoder-based denoising. The
study reveals critical differences between classical and deep learning models
under realistic conditions, offering practical guidelines for building robust
and scalable models in urban fare prediction systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedSWA and FedMoSWA, two federated learning algorithms designed to improve generalization in highly heterogeneous data settings, outperforming FedSAM and FedAvg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the poor generalization of FedSAM in highly heterogeneous data and improve federated learning performance.

Method: Introduces FedSWA (Stochastic Weight Averaging) and FedMoSWA (momentum-based stochastic controlled weight averaging) to find flatter minima and align local-global models.

Result: Theoretical and empirical results show FedSWA and FedMoSWA outperform FedSAM and FedAvg in generalization and optimization errors.

Conclusion: FedSWA and FedMoSWA are effective solutions for federated learning in heterogeneous data settings, with superior performance and theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: For federated learning (FL) algorithms such as FedSAM, their generalization
capability is crucial for real-word applications. In this paper, we revisit the
generalization problem in FL and investigate the impact of data heterogeneity
on FL generalization. We find that FedSAM usually performs worse than FedAvg in
the case of highly heterogeneous data, and thus propose a novel and effective
federated learning algorithm with Stochastic Weight Averaging (called
\texttt{FedSWA}), which aims to find flatter minima in the setting of highly
heterogeneous data. Moreover, we introduce a new momentum-based stochastic
controlled weight averaging FL algorithm (\texttt{FedMoSWA}), which is designed
to better align local and global models.
  Theoretically, we provide both convergence analysis and generalization bounds
for \texttt{FedSWA} and \texttt{FedMoSWA}. We also prove that the optimization
and generalization errors of \texttt{FedMoSWA} are smaller than those of their
counterparts, including FedSAM and its variants. Empirically, experimental
results on CIFAR10/100 and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithms compared to their counterparts. Open source code at:

TL;DR: Irredundant k-fold cross-validation ensures each instance is used once for training and once for testing, reducing redundancy and computational cost while maintaining performance comparable to traditional k-fold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancy in traditional k-fold cross-validation, where instances are reused, leading to disproportionate influence and overfitting.

Method: Introduces Irredundant k-fold cross-validation, ensuring non-overlapping training partitions and balanced dataset utilization.

Result: Delivers consistent performance estimates, less optimistic variance, and reduced computational cost compared to traditional k-fold.

Conclusion: The method is effective, model-agnostic, and improves comparative model analysis by mitigating overfitting and redundancy.

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times
for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many
instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce
Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each
instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the
entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization
of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables
sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves
stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any
classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent
performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold
cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because
training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall
computational cost.

Conclusion: $K^4$ sets a new state-of-the-art for online LogAD with speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Existing Log Anomaly Detection (LogAD) methods are often slow, dependent on

efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) statistics. These descriptors enable
lightweight detectors to accurately score anomalies without retraining. Using a

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how feature-learning dynamics in neural networks, similar to those in grokking, can address primacy bias in continual learning by overwriting outdated features. It proposes increasing the effective learning rate to induce these dynamics, improving generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address primacy bias in continual learning, where early data hinders later generalization, by leveraging feature-learning dynamics observed in grokking.

Method: Increase the effective learning rate (ratio of parameter to update norms) to induce feature-learning dynamics, tested in grokking, warm-starting, and reinforcement learning.

Result: The method successfully facilitates feature-learning and enhances generalization in various settings, including grokking and reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Feature-learning dynamics, accelerated by adjusting the effective learning rate, effectively mitigate primacy bias and improve performance in non-stationary learning tasks.

Abstract: In continual learning problems, it is often necessary to overwrite components
of a neural network's learned representation in response to changes in the data
stream; however, neural networks often exhibit \primacy bias, whereby early
training data hinders the network's ability to generalize on later tasks. While
feature-learning dynamics of nonstationary learning problems are not well
studied, the emergence of feature-learning dynamics is known to drive the
phenomenon of grokking, wherein neural networks initially memorize their
training data and only later exhibit perfect generalization. This work
conjectures that the same feature-learning dynamics which facilitate
generalization in grokking also underlie the ability to overwrite previous
learned features as well, and methods which accelerate grokking by facilitating
feature-learning dynamics are promising candidates for addressing primacy bias
in non-stationary learning problems. We then propose a straightforward method
to induce feature-learning dynamics as needed throughout training by increasing
the effective learning rate, i.e. the ratio between parameter and update norms.
We show that this approach both facilitates feature-learning and improves
generalization in a variety of settings, including grokking, warm-starting
neural network training, and reinforcement learning tasks.

TL;DR: The paper introduces shifts to protect model privacy in federated learning by treating learning as a parameter estimation problem, using Fisher Information to obscure updates, and ensuring accuracy via secure sharing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve model privacy against eavesdroppers in federated learning while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Treats model learning as parameter estimation, derives Fisher Information matrix from shifted updates, and shares shifts securely with the server.

Result: Achieves higher model shift than noise injection with less bandwidth, and passes a convergence test for tampering detection.

Conclusion: The proposed scheme effectively protects privacy and maintains model accuracy with efficient resource use.

Abstract: In this paper, shifts are introduced to preserve model privacy against an
eavesdropper in federated learning. Model learning is treated as a parameter
estimation problem. This perspective allows us to derive the Fisher Information
matrix of the model updates from the shifted updates and drive them to
singularity, thus posing a hard estimation problem for Eve. The shifts are
securely shared with the central server to maintain model accuracy at the
server and participating devices. A convergence test is proposed to detect if
model updates have been tampered with and we show that our scheme passes this
test. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves a higher model shift when
compared to a noise injection scheme while requiring a lesser bandwidth secret
channel.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of balancing free speech and minimizing social distortion in content moderation on social media, proposing practical methods to approximate the optimal solution despite the NP-hard nature of the problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to regulate user-generated content (UGC) on social media to prevent incitements and manipulations while ensuring freedom of speech and reducing social distortion.

Method: Uses mechanism design to optimize the trade-off between minimizing social distortion and maximizing free speech, proposing practical approximation methods and generalization guarantees for offline data.

Result: The problem is NP-hard, but the paper offers practical methods to approximate the optimal solution and determines the required offline data for effective moderation.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework for optimizing content moderation, balancing free speech and social distortion, with practical solutions and data requirements.

Abstract: User-generated content (UGC) on social media platforms is vulnerable to
incitements and manipulations, necessitating effective regulations. To address
these challenges, those platforms often deploy automated content moderators
tasked with evaluating the harmfulness of UGC and filtering out content that
violates established guidelines. However, such moderation inevitably gives rise
to strategic responses from users, who strive to express themselves within the
confines of guidelines. Such phenomena call for a careful balance between: 1.
ensuring freedom of speech -- by minimizing the restriction of expression; and
2. reducing social distortion -- measured by the total amount of content
manipulation. We tackle the problem of optimizing this balance through the lens
of mechanism design, aiming at optimizing the trade-off between minimizing
social distortion and maximizing free speech. Although determining the optimal
trade-off is NP-hard, we propose practical methods to approximate the optimal
solution. Additionally, we provide generalization guarantees determining the
amount of finite offline data required to approximate the optimal moderator
effectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for PDEs on complex geometries improves flexibility, computational efficiency, and accuracy compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical geometric learning methods rely on fixed representations like meshes or graphs, limiting flexibility and efficiency for complex geometries.

Method: Generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density functions, using OT to map these to a uniform density in a reference space. For 3D surfaces, embeds geometry into a 2D latent space for efficient computation.

Result: Achieves better accuracy and reduces computational expenses (time and memory) on RANS equations for ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets. Also improves accuracy on FlowBench.

Conclusion: OT-based operator learning with instance-dependent deformation is more flexible, efficient, and accurate for PDEs on variable geometries.

Abstract: We propose integrating optimal transport (OT) into operator learning for
partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Classical
geometric learning methods typically represent domains as meshes, graphs, or
point clouds. Our approach generalizes discretized meshes to mesh density
functions, formulating geometry embedding as an OT problem that maps these
functions to a uniform density in a reference space. Compared to previous
methods relying on interpolation or shared deformation, our OT-based method
employs instance-dependent deformation, offering enhanced flexibility and
effectiveness. For 3D simulations focused on surfaces, our OT-based neural
operator embeds the surface geometry into a 2D parameterized latent space. By
performing computations directly on this 2D representation of the surface
manifold, it achieves significant computational efficiency gains compared to
volumetric simulation. Experiments with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
equations (RANS) on the ShapeNet-Car and DrivAerNet-Car datasets show that our
method achieves better accuracy and also reduces computational expenses in
terms of both time and memory usage compared to existing machine learning
models. Additionally, our model demonstrates significantly improved accuracy on
the FlowBench dataset, underscoring the benefits of employing
instance-dependent deformation for datasets with highly variable geometries.

Motivation: Existing OPE methods lack principled uncertainty quantification when using biased auxiliary datasets, which is critical for high-stakes settings like healthcare.

Method: Two approaches: (1) a conformal prediction method for high-dimensional MDPs to estimate policy performance per initial state, and (2) doubly robust estimation for average policy performance.

Result: The methods produce reliable confidence intervals covering ground truth values in simulations (robotics, healthcare, inventory) and a real MIMIC-IV healthcare dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively leverage augmented data while ensuring valid uncertainty quantification, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) methods aim to estimate the value of a new
reinforcement learning (RL) policy prior to deployment. Recent advances have
shown that leveraging auxiliary datasets, such as those synthesized by
generative models, can improve the accuracy of these value estimates.
Unfortunately, such auxiliary datasets may also be biased, and existing methods
for using data augmentation for OPE in RL lack principled uncertainty
quantification. In high stakes settings like healthcare, reliable uncertainty
estimates are important for comparing policy value estimates. In this work, we
propose two approaches to construct valid confidence intervals for OPE when
using data augmentation. The first provides a confidence interval over the
policy performance conditioned on a particular initial state $V^{\pi}(s_0)$--
such intervals are particularly important for human-centered applications. To
do so we introduce a new conformal prediction method for high dimensional state
MDPs. Second, we consider the more common task of estimating the average policy
performance over many initial states; to do so we draw on ideas from doubly
robust estimation and prediction powered inference. Across simulators spanning
robotics, healthcare and inventory management, and a real healthcare dataset
from MIMIC-IV, we find that our methods can use augmented data and still
consistently produce intervals that cover the ground truth values, unlike
previously proposed methods.

*Jiaqiang Li,Jianbin Tan,Xueqin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sparse Equation Matching (SEM), a derivative-free framework for discovering equations in general-order dynamical systems, validated through simulations and applied to EEG data for brain connectivity analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing equation discovery methods rely on accurate derivative estimation and are limited to first-order systems, restricting their real-world applicability.

Method: SEM uses integral-based sparse regression with Green's functions for derivative-free estimation of differential operators and driving functions in general-order systems.

Result: SEM outperforms derivative-based approaches in simulations and successfully identifies active brain regions and task-specific connectivity patterns in EEG data.

Conclusion: SEM provides a versatile and effective tool for equation discovery, offering insights into complex systems like brain connectivity.

Abstract: Equation discovery is a fundamental learning task for uncovering the
underlying dynamics of complex systems, with wide-ranging applications in areas
such as brain connectivity analysis, climate modeling, gene regulation, and
physical system simulation. However, many existing approaches rely on accurate
derivative estimation and are limited to first-order dynamical systems,
restricting their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose sparse equation matching (SEM), a unified framework that encompasses
several existing equation discovery methods under a common formulation. SEM
introduces an integral-based sparse regression method using Green's functions,
enabling derivative-free estimation of differential operators and their
associated driving functions in general-order dynamical systems. The
effectiveness of SEM is demonstrated through extensive simulations,
benchmarking its performance against derivative-based approaches. We then apply
SEM to electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during multiple oculomotor
tasks, collected from 52 participants in a brain-computer interface experiment.
Our method identifies active brain regions across participants and reveals
task-specific connectivity patterns. These findings offer valuable insights
into brain connectivity and the underlying neural mechanisms.

*Adelaide Danilov,Aria Nourbakhsh,Christoph Schommer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework combining cross-entropy loss with Cluster Purge Loss improves embedding space structure for equivalent code mutant detection, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for transformer models often fail to structure embedding spaces to reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships, crucial for tasks like equivalent mutant detection.

Method: The framework integrates cross-entropy loss with Cluster Purge Loss, focusing on fine-grained intra-class differences and dynamically adjusting borders for semantic separation.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable embedding space.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively structures the embedding space, enhancing performance and interpretability for code processing tasks.

Abstract: Recent pre-trained transformer models achieve superior performance in various
code processing objectives. However, although effective at optimizing decision
boundaries, common approaches for fine-tuning them for downstream
classification tasks - distance-based methods or training an additional
classification head - often fail to thoroughly structure the embedding space to
reflect nuanced intra-class semantic relationships. Equivalent code mutant
detection is one of these tasks, where the quality of the embedding space is
crucial to the performance of the models. We introduce a novel framework that
integrates cross-entropy loss with a deep metric learning objective, termed
Cluster Purge Loss. This objective, unlike conventional approaches,
concentrates on adjusting fine-grained differences within each class,
encouraging the separation of instances based on semantical equivalency to the
class center using dynamically adjusted borders. Employing UniXCoder as the
base model, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in the
domain of equivalent mutant detection and produces a more interpretable
embedding space.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for learning hidden graph structures from data

discrete Sobolev spaces on graphs for scalar/vector fields, establishing key
functional properties; (2) Introduces gauge-equivalent nonlinear Schr\"odinger
and Landau--Lifshitz dynamics with provable stable stationary solutions
smoothly dependent on input data and graph weights; (3) Develops a stochastic
gradient algorithm over graph moduli spaces with sparsity regularization.
Theoretically, we guarantee: topological correctness (homology recovery),

TL;DR: Meta Fusion is a flexible framework unifying traditional multimodal data fusion methods, enhancing predictive performance through soft information sharing and model-agnostic learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional fusion methods (early, intermediate, late) and improve predictive power in applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis.

Method: Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models using latent representations across modalities, leveraging soft information sharing and deep mutual learning.

Result: Outperforms conventional fusion strategies in simulations and real-world applications like Alzheimer's disease detection and neural decoding.

Conclusion: Meta Fusion provides a principled, adaptable solution for multimodal data fusion, reducing generalization error and improving performance.

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal data fusion strategies has become
increasingly essential for improving the predictive power of statistical
machine learning methods across a wide range of applications, from autonomous
driving to medical diagnosis. Traditional fusion methods, including early,
intermediate, and late fusion, integrate data at different stages, each
offering distinct advantages and limitations. In this paper, we introduce Meta
Fusion, a flexible and principled framework that unifies these existing
strategies as special cases. Motivated by deep mutual learning and ensemble
learning, Meta Fusion constructs a cohort of models based on various
combinations of latent representations across modalities, and further boosts
predictive performance through soft information sharing within the cohort. Our
approach is model-agnostic in learning the latent representations, allowing it
to flexibly adapt to the unique characteristics of each modality.
Theoretically, our soft information sharing mechanism reduces the
generalization error. Empirically, Meta Fusion consistently outperforms
conventional fusion strategies in extensive simulation studies. We further
validate our approach on real-world applications, including Alzheimer's disease
detection and neural decoding.

TL;DR: EcoTransformer replaces dot-product attention with a Laplacian kernel convolution for energy-efficient performance without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scaled dot-product attention in Transformers is computationally intensive and energy-consuming, prompting a need for a more efficient alternative.

Method: EcoTransformer constructs the output context vector using a Laplacian kernel convolution with L1 metric distances between queries and keys, eliminating matrix multiplication.

Result: EcoTransformer matches or outperforms dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks while reducing energy consumption.

Conclusion: EcoTransformer offers a computationally efficient and energy-saving alternative to traditional Transformer attention mechanisms.

Abstract: The Transformer, with its scaled dot-product attention mechanism, has become
a foundational architecture in modern AI. However, this mechanism is
computationally intensive and incurs substantial energy costs. We propose a new
Transformer architecture EcoTransformer, in which the output context vector is
constructed as the convolution of the values using a Laplacian kernel, where
the distances are measured by the L1 metric between the queries and keys.
Compared to dot-product based attention, the new attention score calculation is
free of matrix multiplication. It performs on par with, or even surpasses,
scaled dot-product attention in NLP, bioinformatics, and vision tasks, while
consuming significantly less energy.

TL;DR: The Graded Transformer framework introduces algebraic inductive biases into sequence models via grading transformations, proposing two architectures (LGT and EGT) with theoretical guarantees and broad applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance efficiency and structure in sequence models by embedding algebraic principles, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.

Method: Proposes Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT) with parameterized scaling operators and graded loss functions.

Result: Theoretical guarantees include universal approximation, reduced sample complexity, robustness, and gradient stability.

Conclusion: The framework advances structured deep learning, offering interpretable and efficient systems for complex domains like NLP, physics, and biology.

Abstract: We introduce the Graded Transformer framework, a novel class of sequence
models that embeds algebraic inductive biases through grading transformations
on vector spaces. Extending the theory of Graded Neural Networks (GNNs), we
propose two architectures: the Linearly Graded Transformer (LGT) and the
Exponentially Graded Transformer (EGT). These models apply parameterized
scaling operators-governed by fixed or learnable grading tuples and, for EGT,
exponential factors to infuse hierarchical structure into attention and
representation layers, enhancing efficiency for structured data.
  We derive rigorous theoretical guarantees, including universal approximation
theorems for continuous and Sobolev functions, reduced sample complexity via
effective VC dimension bounds, Lipschitz continuity of graded operations, and
robustness to adversarial perturbations. A graded loss function ensures
gradient stability and alignment with domain priors during optimization. By
treating grades as differentiable parameters, the framework enables adaptive
feature prioritization, overcoming limitations of fixed grades in prior work.
  The Graded Transformer holds transformative potential for hierarchical
learning and neurosymbolic reasoning, with applications spanning algebraic
geometry (e.g., moduli spaces and zeta functions), physics (e.g., multiscale
simulations), natural language processing (e.g., syntactic parsing), biological
sequence analysis (e.g., variant prediction), and emerging areas like graph
neural networks and financial modeling. This work advances structured deep
learning by fusing geometric and algebraic principles with attention
mechanisms, offering a mathematically grounded alternative to data-driven

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the PUCS framework for sequential decision-making with costly information acquisition, offering offline and online solutions with performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses scenarios like ridesharing and content recommendation where resources and rewards are initially unknown and probing is costly.

Method: Offline: greedy probing algorithm with constant-factor approximation. Online: OLPA, a stochastic combinatorial bandit algorithm.

Result: Offline achieves ζ = (e-1)/(2e-1) approximation. Online achieves O(√T + ln² T) regret, with a proven lower bound Ω(√T).

Conclusion: The proposed solutions are effective, as validated by real-world experiments.

Abstract: We formalize sequential decision-making with information acquisition as the
probing-augmented user-centric selection (PUCS) framework, where a learner
first probes a subset of arms to obtain side information on resources and
rewards, and then assigns $K$ plays to $M$ arms. PUCS covers applications such
as ridesharing, wireless scheduling, and content recommendation, in which both
resources and payoffs are initially unknown and probing is costly. For the
offline setting with known distributions, we present a greedy probing algorithm
with a constant-factor approximation guarantee $\zeta = (e-1)/(2e-1)$. For the
online setting with unknown distributions, we introduce OLPA, a stochastic
combinatorial bandit algorithm that achieves a regret bound
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} + \ln^{2} T)$. We also prove a lower bound
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$, showing that the upper bound is tight up to logarithmic
factors. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve traditional wine analysis methods by integrating spectroscopy and ML for sensory data and origin classification.

Method: Combined UV-Vis spectrophotometry with ML techniques, focusing on SVM for prediction tasks.

Result: SVM achieved over 91% accuracy in origin prediction; influential wavelengths were identified (250-420 nm).

Conclusion: The study offers a foundation for integrating big data and IoT in the wine industry, advancing 'Smart Wineries'.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to use absorbance data obtained by human tasting
and an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) scanning spectrophotometer to predict the
attributes of grape juice (GJ) and to classify the wine's origin, respectively.
The approach combined machine learning (ML) techniques with spectroscopy to
find a relatively simple way to apply them in two stages of winemaking and help
improve the traditional wine analysis methods regarding sensory data and wine's
origins. This new technique has overcome the disadvantages of the complex
sensors by taking advantage of spectral fingerprinting technology and forming a
comprehensive study of the employment of AI in the wine analysis domain. In the
results, Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the most efficient and robust in both
attributes and origin prediction tasks. Both the accuracy and F1 score of the
origin prediction exceed 91%. The feature ranking approach found that the more
influential wavelengths usually appear at the lower end of the scan range, 250
nm (nanometers) to 420 nm, which is believed to be of great help for selecting
appropriate validation methods and sensors to extract wine data in future
research. The knowledge of this research provides new ideas and early solutions
for the wine industry or other beverage industries to integrate big data and
IoT in the future, which significantly promotes the development of 'Smart
Wineries'.

*Xuanting Xie,Bingheng Li,Erlin Pan,Zhao Kang,Wenyu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMLP is an unsupervised framework that adapts MLP to graph aggregation, improving performance in heterophilic graphs without relying on labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs use fixed aggregators without reasoning, leading to poor performance in heterophilic graphs. Existing methods rely on labeled data, which is scarce.

Method: AMLP uses graph reconstruction for high-order grouping and a single-layer network to encode heterophily, making MLP adaptive to aggregation.

Result: AMLP outperforms in node clustering and classification, showing adaptability to diverse graph scenarios.

Conclusion: AMLP offers a lightweight, unsupervised solution for graph learning, enhancing performance in heterophilic settings.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a dominant approach to learning
graph representations, primarily because of their message-passing mechanisms.
However, GNNs typically adopt a fixed aggregator function such as Mean, Max, or
Sum without principled reasoning behind the selection. This rigidity,
especially in the presence of heterophily, often leads to poor, problem
dependent performance. Although some attempts address this by designing more
sophisticated aggregation functions, these methods tend to rely heavily on
labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world tasks. In this work, we
propose a novel unsupervised framework, "Aggregation-aware Multilayer
Perceptron" (AMLP), which shifts the paradigm from directly crafting
aggregation functions to making MLP adaptive to aggregation. Our lightweight
approach consists of two key steps: First, we utilize a graph reconstruction
method that facilitates high-order grouping effects, and second, we employ a
single-layer network to encode varying degrees of heterophily, thereby
improving the capacity and applicability of the model. Extensive experiments on
node clustering and classification demonstrate the superior performance of
AMLP, highlighting its potential for diverse graph learning scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative models lack sufficient training data for SBDD tasks, limiting their application in drug design.

Method: MEVO integrates a VQ-VAE for molecule representation, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided generation, and an evolutionary strategy for optimization with physics-based scoring.

Result: MEVO successfully designs high-affinity binders, including potent KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$ inhibitors, validated by free energy perturbation (FEP) methods.

Conclusion: MEVO provides a versatile, data-efficient solution for structure-based ligand design, overcoming data constraints in generative SBDD models.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models, particularly diffusion and
auto-regressive models, have revolutionized fields like computer vision and
natural language processing. However, their application to structure-based drug
design (SBDD) remains limited due to critical data constraints. To address the
limitation of training data for models targeting SBDD tasks, we propose an
evolutionary framework named MEVO, which bridges the gap between billion-scale
small molecule dataset and the scarce protein-ligand complex dataset, and
effectively increase the abundance of training data for generative SBDD models.
MEVO is composed of three key components: a high-fidelity VQ-VAE for molecule
representation in latent space, a diffusion model for pharmacophore-guided
molecule generation, and a pocket-aware evolutionary strategy for molecule
optimization with physics-based scoring function. This framework efficiently
generate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with
predicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods. In
addition, we showcase the capability of MEVO in designing potent inhibitors to
KRAS$^{\textrm{G12D}}$, a challenging target in cancer therapeutics, with
similar affinity to the known highly active inhibitor evaluated by FEP
calculations. With high versatility and generalizability, MEVO offers an
effective and data-efficient model for various tasks in structure-based ligand
design.

TL;DR: ASNN learns the relationship between neural network architecture and accuracy, suggesting improved designs, outperforming random search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No general function maps NN architecture to accuracy, making design heuristic or search-based. ASNN aims to automate and improve this process.

Method: ASNN is trained on datasets of NN architectures (varying layers/nodes) and their test accuracies. It predicts better architectures iteratively.

Result: ASNN suggested architectures outperforming original training data in 2-layer and 3-layer cases, improving mean test accuracies.

Conclusion: ASNN offers an efficient alternative to random search for NN architecture optimization, promising for automating design.

Abstract: The architecture of a neural network (NN) plays a critical role in
determining its performance. However, there is no general closed-form function
that maps between network structure and accuracy, making the process of
architecture design largely heuristic or search-based. In this study, we
propose the Architecture Suggesting Neural Network (ASNN), a model designed to
learn the relationship between NN architecture and its test accuracy, and to
suggest improved architectures accordingly. To train ASNN, we constructed
datasets using TensorFlow-based models with varying numbers of layers and
nodes. Experimental results were collected for both 2-layer and 3-layer
architectures across a grid of configurations, each evaluated with 10 repeated
trials to account for stochasticity. Accuracy values were treated as inputs,
and architectural parameters as outputs. The trained ASNN was then used
iteratively to predict architectures that yield higher performance. In both
2-layer and 3-layer cases, ASNN successfully suggested architectures that
outperformed the best results found in the original training data. Repeated
prediction and retraining cycles led to the discovery of architectures with
improved mean test accuracies, demonstrating the model's capacity to generalize
the performance-structure relationship. These results suggest that ASNN
provides an efficient alternative to random search for architecture
optimization, and offers a promising approach toward automating neural network
design. "Parts of the manuscript, including text editing and expression

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes IS²C, a novel importance sampling-based method for partial domain adaptation (PDA), addressing label distribution shift and enhancing model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDA faces challenges in correcting label distribution shifts and avoiding overfitting on the source domain. Existing reweighing techniques are insufficient.

Method: IS²C samples labeled data from a built sampling domain with target-like label distribution, uses mixture distribution for shift correction, and aligns conditional distributions via optimal transport.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show IS²C dominates generalization error. Experiments on PDA benchmarks confirm its superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: IS²C effectively addresses PDA challenges, improves generalization, and outperforms prior techniques.

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) is a challenging task in real-world machine
learning scenarios. It aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain
to a related unlabeled target domain, where the support set of the source label
distribution subsumes the target one. Previous PDA works managed to correct the
label distribution shift by weighting samples in the source domain. However,
the simple reweighing technique cannot explore the latent structure and
sufficiently use the labeled data, and then models are prone to over-fitting on
the source domain. In this work, we propose a novel importance sampling-based
shift correction (IS$^2$C) method, where new labeled data are sampled from a
built sampling domain, whose label distribution is supposed to be the same as
the target domain, to characterize the latent structure and enhance the
generalization ability of the model. We provide theoretical guarantees for
IS$^2$C by proving that the generalization error can be sufficiently dominated
by IS$^2$C. In particular, by implementing sampling with the mixture
distribution, the extent of shift between source and sampling domains can be
connected to generalization error, which provides an interpretable way to build
IS$^2$C. To improve knowledge transfer, an optimal transport-based independence
criterion is proposed for conditional distribution alignment, where the
computation of the criterion can be adjusted to reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ in realistic PDA scenarios. Extensive
experiments on PDA benchmarks validate the theoretical results and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our IS$^2$C over existing methods.

Conclusion: TINs combine legacy indicators with AI, advancing algorithmic trading.

Abstract: This work proposes that a vast majority of classical technical indicators in

commonly used technical constructs, can be reconstructed topologically as
modular neural network components. Technical Indicator Networks (TINs) are
introduced as a general neural architecture that replicates and structurally
upgrades traditional indicators by supporting n-dimensional inputs such as
price, volume, sentiment, and order book data. By encoding domain-specific
knowledge into neural structures, TINs modernize the foundational logic of
technical analysis and propel algorithmic trading into a new era, bridging the
legacy of proven indicators with the potential of contemporary AI systems.

Result: Provides a fair comparison of methods using the same dataset and metrics, with high-level mathematical abstraction for future prototyping.

Conclusion: Protein-SE(3) is the first comprehensive benchmark for SE(3)-based protein design, publicly available for broader use.

Abstract: SE(3)-based generative models have shown great promise in protein geometry
modeling and effective structure design. However, the field currently lacks a
modularized benchmark to enable comprehensive investigation and fair comparison
of different methods. In this paper, we propose Protein-SE(3), a new benchmark
based on a unified training framework, which comprises protein scaffolding
tasks, integrated generative models, high-level mathematical abstraction, and
diverse evaluation metrics. Recent advanced generative models designed for
protein scaffolding, from multiple perspectives like DDPM (Genie1 and Genie2),
Score Matching (FrameDiff and RfDiffusion) and Flow Matching (FoldFlow and
FrameFlow) are integrated into our framework. All integrated methods are fairly
investigated with the same training dataset and evaluation metrics.
Furthermore, we provide a high-level abstraction of the mathematical
foundations behind the generative models, enabling fast prototyping of future
algorithms without reliance on explicit protein structures. Accordingly, we
release the first comprehensive benchmark built upon unified training framework
for SE(3)-based protein structure design, which is publicly accessible at

TL;DR: TLRS, a novel reward shaping method, enhances RL for mining alpha factors by providing dense rewards and reducing training variance, improving predictive power and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for mining alpha factors suffer from sparse rewards, limiting exploration and destabilizing training.

Method: Proposes Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), which offers dense rewards via subsequence-level similarity to expert formulas and includes a reward centering mechanism.

Result: TLRS boosts the Rank Information Coefficient by 9.29% and improves computational efficiency by reducing time complexity from linear to constant.

Conclusion: TLRS significantly enhances RL-based alpha factor mining, offering better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has successfully automated the complex process of
mining formulaic alpha factors, for creating interpretable and profitable
investment strategies. However, existing methods are hampered by the sparse
rewards given the underlying Markov Decision Process. This inefficiency limits
the exploration of the vast symbolic search space and destabilizes the training
process. To address this, Trajectory-level Reward Shaping (TLRS), a novel
reward shaping method, is proposed. TLRS provides dense, intermediate rewards
by measuring the subsequence-level similarity between partially generated
expressions and a set of expert-designed formulas. Furthermore, a reward
centering mechanism is introduced to reduce training variance. Extensive
experiments on six major Chinese and U.S. stock indices show that TLRS
significantly improves the predictive power of mined factors, boosting the Rank
Information Coefficient by 9.29% over existing potential-based shaping
algorithms. Notably, TLRS achieves a major leap in computational efficiency by
reducing its time complexity with respect to the feature dimension from linear
to constant, which is a significant improvement over distance-based baselines.

TL;DR: A novel method uses limited calibration data to fine-tune a predictor and estimate synthetic label bias, ensuring rigorous coverage for AI decisions, validated on indoor localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of calibration data for quantifying AI decision uncertainty by leveraging synthetic labels, while minimizing additional data needs.

Method: Simultaneously fine-tunes a predictor and estimates synthetic label bias using limited calibration data, ensuring coverage guarantees for AI decisions.

Result: Effective performance gains demonstrated in experiments on an indoor localization problem.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently tackles calibration data scarcity, providing reliable uncertainty quantification for AI models.

Abstract: Calibration data are necessary to formally quantify the uncertainty of the
decisions produced by an existing artificial intelligence (AI) model. To
overcome the common issue of scarce calibration data, a promising approach is
to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive
model. However, fine-tuning the label-generating predictor on the inference
task of interest, as well as estimating the residual bias of the synthetic
labels, demand additional data, potentially exacerbating the calibration data
scarcity problem. This paper introduces a novel approach that efficiently
utilizes limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and
estimate the bias of the synthetic labels. The proposed method yields
prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees for AI-generated decisions.
Experimental results on an indoor localization problem validate the
effectiveness and performance gains of our solution.

### [375] [Approximating Full Conformal Prediction for Neural Network Regression with Gauss-Newton Influence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20272)
*Dharmesh Tailor,Alvaro H. C. Correia,Eric Nalisnick,Christos Louizos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to construct prediction intervals for neural network regressors without held-out data by approximating full conformal prediction (full-CP) using Gauss-Newton influence and linearization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in safety-critical areas require well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, but existing methods like Laplace's method and split conformal prediction (split-CP) have limitations (miscalibration or reduced efficiency).

Method: The method approximates full-CP by training once and perturbing model parameters locally using Gauss-Newton influence, coupled with network linearization to efficiently compute nonconformity scores.

Result: The proposed method produces locally-adaptive prediction intervals that are often tighter than those of split-CP, demonstrated on regression benchmarks and bounding box localization.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical and efficient way to generate well-calibrated prediction intervals for neural networks without requiring held-out data.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of
deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the
uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are
well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates
(e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches
that operate post-hoc include Laplace's method and split conformal prediction
(split-CP). However, Laplace's method can be miscalibrated when the model is
misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the
expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction
intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is
achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP).
Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and
candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model
parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of
retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute
residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate
label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search
over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box
localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive
and often tighter than those of split-CP.

*Jiaxi Wang,Yaosen Min,Xun Zhu,Miao Li,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIPS, a pre-training framework for polymers, combining topological and spatial data to improve property prediction, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to capture polymer properties accurately due to changes during polymerization. MIPS addresses this by modeling polymers as infinite monomer sequences.

Method: MIPS integrates topological (MPM, GAM, LGA) and spatial (3D descriptors) information, using a cross-modal fusion mechanism. It also introduces backbone embedding for ring structures.

Result: MIPS outperforms existing methods in eight polymer property prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MIPS provides a robust and comprehensive framework for polymer property prediction, overcoming limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Polymers, composed of repeating structural units called monomers, are
fundamental materials in daily life and industry. Accurate property prediction
for polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.
However, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by
the constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,
since the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,
we propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training
framework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and
integrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.
From the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)
and graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we
demonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to
applying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose
to further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).
Moreover, we show the robustness of the "star linking" strategy through Repeat
and Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, "star linking"
strategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,
a common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)
test. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the
capability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial
perspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial
information. Finally, we design a cross-modal fusion mechanism to unify the
topological and spatial information. Experimental validation across eight
diverse polymer property prediction tasks reveals that MIPS achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EduAlign is a framework to align LLMs with educational principles (Helpfulness, Personalization, Creativity) using a reward model (HPC-RM) and fine-tuning, improving their effectiveness as educational assistants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs lack alignment with pedagogical principles like helpfulness, personalization, and creativity, limiting their effectiveness in education.

Method: EduAlign involves curating and annotating educational interactions to train HPC-RM, then using it to fine-tune an LLM with GRPO.

Result: The fine-tuned model shows significant improvement in alignment with educational principles.

Conclusion: EduAlign offers a scalable method to enhance LLMs for educational use, enabling more pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into education presents
unprecedented opportunities for scalable personalized learning. However,
standard LLMs often function as generic information providers, lacking
alignment with fundamental pedagogical principles such as helpfulness,
student-centered personalization, and creativity cultivation. To bridge this
gap, we propose EduAlign, a novel framework designed to guide LLMs toward
becoming more effective and responsible educational assistants. EduAlign
consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we curate a dataset of 8k
educational interactions and annotate them-both manually and
automatically-along three key educational dimensions: Helpfulness,
Personalization, and Creativity (HPC). These annotations are used to train
HPC-RM, a multi-dimensional reward model capable of accurately scoring LLM
outputs according to these educational principles. We further evaluate the
consistency and reliability of this reward model. In the second stage, we
leverage HPC-RM as a reward signal to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM using Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on a set of 2k diverse prompts. We then
assess the pre- and post-finetuning models on both educational and
general-domain benchmarks across the three HPC dimensions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the fine-tuned model exhibits significantly improved alignment
with pedagogical helpfulness, personalization, and creativity stimulation. This
study presents a scalable and effective approach to aligning LLMs with nuanced
and desirable educational traits, paving the way for the development of more
engaging, pedagogically aligned AI tutors.

TL;DR: A GNN-based probabilistic framework for causal discovery outperforms traditional methods by learning a distribution over causal graphs, leveraging node and edge attributes, and training on diverse synthetic datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional causal discovery methods struggle with scalability and capturing global structural information in large datasets with complex relationships.

Method: Introduces a GNN-based probabilistic framework that learns a distribution over causal graphs, using node and edge attributes. Trained on synthetic datasets with statistical measures like mutual information.

Result: Outperforms traditional and recent non-GNN methods in accuracy and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The framework significantly improves causal structure learning, benefiting decision-making and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is challenging, especially with
large datasets and complex relationships. Traditional methods often struggle
with scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based
probabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire
space of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic
graph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes
into a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal
structures directly from data. The GNN model is trained on a diverse set of
synthetic datasets augmented with statistical and information-theoretic
measures, such as mutual information and conditional entropy, capturing both
local and global data properties. We frame causal discovery as a supervised
learning problem, directly predicting the entire graph structure. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance, outperforming both traditional and recent
non-GNN-based methods, as well as a GNN-based approach, in terms of accuracy
and scalability on synthetic and real-world datasets without further training.
This probabilistic framework significantly improves causal structure learning,
with broad implications for decision-making and scientific discovery across
various fields.

the standard single-grade deep learning (SGDL) across various applications.
This work aims to investigate the computational advantages of MGDL focusing on
its performance in image regression, denoising, and deblurring tasks, and

TL;DR: A novel framework, Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR), addresses wafer defect root cause analysis by handling variable-length processing routes and heterogeneous processes using new representation learning methods (proc2vec and route2vec).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identifying root causes of wafer defects is difficult due to complex process flows and variability in processing routes.

Method: PTR compares counterfactual outcomes from partial trajectories using proc2vec and route2vec for representation learning.

Result: The framework effectively analyzes wafer defect root causes, demonstrated with real data from NY CREATES fab.

Conclusion: PTR provides a robust solution for wafer defect root cause analysis, overcoming limitations of conventional methods.

Abstract: Identifying upstream processes responsible for wafer defects is challenging
due to the combinatorial nature of process flows and the inherent variability
in processing routes, which arises from factors such as rework operations and
random process waiting times. This paper presents a novel framework for wafer
defect root cause analysis, called Partial Trajectory Regression (PTR). The
proposed framework is carefully designed to address the limitations of
conventional vector-based regression models, particularly in handling
variable-length processing routes that span a large number of heterogeneous
physical processes. To compute the attribution score of each process given a
detected high defect density on a specific wafer, we propose a new algorithm
that compares two counterfactual outcomes derived from partial process
trajectories. This is enabled by new representation learning methods, proc2vec
and route2vec. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using
real wafer history data from the NY CREATES fab in Albany.

*Hengyu Liu,Tianyi Li,Yuqiang He,Kristian Torp,Yushuai Li,Christian S. Jensen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MH-GIN is a graph-based network for imputing missing values in maritime tracking data by capturing multi-scale dependencies among heterogeneous attributes, outperforming existing methods by 57% in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing values in maritime tracking data hinder safety and monitoring applications, and existing imputation methods fail to address multi-scale dependencies among attributes.

Method: MH-GIN extracts multi-scale temporal features, constructs a heterogeneous graph to model dependencies, and uses graph propagation for imputation.

Result: MH-GIN reduces imputation errors by 57% on average compared to state-of-the-art methods while remaining computationally efficient.

Conclusion: MH-GIN effectively addresses the challenge of missing data in maritime tracking by leveraging multi-scale dependencies, offering significant accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Location-tracking data from the Automatic Identification System, much of
which is publicly available, plays a key role in a range of maritime safety and
monitoring applications. However, the data suffers from missing values that
hamper downstream applications. Imputing the missing values is challenging
because the values of different heterogeneous attributes are updated at diverse
rates, resulting in the occurrence of multi-scale dependencies among
attributes. Existing imputation methods that assume similar update rates across
attributes are unable to capture and exploit such dependencies, limiting their
imputation accuracy. We propose MH-GIN, a Multi-scale Heterogeneous Graph-based
Imputation Network that aims improve imputation accuracy by capturing
multi-scale dependencies. Specifically, MH-GIN first extracts multi-scale
temporal features for each attribute while preserving their intrinsic
heterogeneous characteristics. Then, it constructs a multi-scale heterogeneous
graph to explicitly model dependencies between heterogeneous attributes to
enable more accurate imputation of missing values through graph propagation.
Experimental results on two real-world datasets find that MH-GIN is capable of
an average 57% reduction in imputation errors compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code and
implementation details of MH-GIN are publicly available

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trajectory Shapley Attribution (TSA) to identify problematic upstream processes causing wafer defects, addressing limitations of standard Shapley values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of semiconductor manufacturing makes root cause analysis for wafer defects challenging, requiring a method that accounts for sequential processes.

Method: Proposes TSA, an extension of Shapley values, to handle sequential manufacturing processes and avoid arbitrary reference points. Applied to a wafer diagnosis task.

Result: TSA successfully identified measurement items relevant to abnormal defect occurrence in experimental processes.

Conclusion: TSA provides a robust framework for root cause analysis in semiconductor manufacturing, overcoming key limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: How can we identify problematic upstream processes when a certain type of
wafer defect starts appearing at a quality checkpoint? Given the complexity of
modern semiconductor manufacturing, which involves thousands of process steps,
cross-process root cause analysis for wafer defects has been considered highly
challenging. This paper proposes a novel framework called Trajectory Shapley
Attribution (TSA), an extension of Shapley values (SV), a widely used
attribution algorithm in explainable artificial intelligence research. TSA
overcomes key limitations of standard SV, including its disregard for the
sequential nature of manufacturing processes and its reliance on an arbitrarily
chosen reference point. We applied TSA to a good-bad wafer diagnosis task in
experimental front-end-of-line processes at the NY CREATES Albany NanoTech fab,
aiming to identify measurement items (serving as proxies for process
parameters) most relevant to abnormal defect occurrence.

*Ahmed Shokry,Ayman Khalafallah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel meta-learning-based clustering approach eliminates parameter tuning, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and leverages pre-clustered samples for accurate, scalable clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing clustering algorithms face challenges like parameter tuning, high complexity, and suboptimal accuracy, especially for large datasets.

Method: Uses a Prior-Data Fitted Transformer Network (PFN) to compute attention between pre-clustered and unclustered samples, inferring cluster assignments in a single forward pass.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, generalizes well with few pre-clustered samples, and works even without them.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, scalable, and a promising alternative to current clustering methods.

Abstract: Clustering is a core task in machine learning with wide-ranging applications
in data mining and pattern recognition. However, its unsupervised nature makes
it inherently challenging. Many existing clustering algorithms suffer from
critical limitations: they often require careful parameter tuning, exhibit high
computational complexity, lack interpretability, or yield suboptimal accuracy,
especially when applied to large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a
novel clustering approach based on meta-learning. Our approach eliminates the
need for parameter optimization while achieving accuracy that outperforms
state-of-the-art clustering techniques. The proposed technique leverages a few
pre-clustered samples to guide the clustering process for the entire dataset in
a single forward pass. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted
Transformer Network (PFN) to perform clustering. The algorithm computes
attention between the pre-clustered samples and the unclustered samples,
allowing it to infer cluster assignments for the entire dataset based on the
learned relation. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that, given just
a few pre-clustered examples, the model can generalize to accurately cluster
the rest of the dataset. Experiments on challenging benchmark datasets show
that our approach can successfully cluster well-separated data without any
pre-clustered samples, and significantly improves performance when a few
clustered samples are provided. We show that our approach is superior to the
state-of-the-art techniques. These results highlight the effectiveness and
scalability of our approach, positioning it as a promising alternative to
existing clustering techniques.

Motivation: Black hole anomalies cause packet loss without notifications, disrupting connectivity and causing financial losses.

Method: Combines Wasserstein GAN, attention mechanisms, LSTM, and convolutional layers for stable training and anomaly detection.

Result: Achieves significant F1 score improvements (1.65% to 58.76%) and detects previously undetected anomalies.

Conclusion: WBHT is efficient and valuable for proactive network monitoring, especially in mission-critical networks.

Abstract: We propose the Wasserstein Black Hole Transformer (WBHT) framework for
detecting black hole (BH) anomalies in communication networks. These anomalies
cause packet loss without failure notifications, disrupting connectivity and
leading to financial losses. WBHT combines generative modeling, sequential
learning, and attention mechanisms to improve BH anomaly detection. It
integrates a Wasserstein generative adversarial network with attention
mechanisms for stable training and accurate anomaly identification. The model
uses long-short-term memory layers to capture long-term dependencies and
convolutional layers for local temporal patterns. A latent space encoding
mechanism helps distinguish abnormal network behavior. Tested on real-world
network data, WBHT outperforms existing models, achieving significant
improvements in F1 score (ranging from 1.65% to 58.76%). Its efficiency and
ability to detect previously undetected anomalies make it a valuable tool for
proactive network monitoring and security, especially in mission-critical

TL;DR: The paper introduces a distributed training algorithm (DPPF) that improves communication efficiency and model performance by leveraging a sharpness measure (Inverse Mean Valley) to find flatter minima in the loss landscape.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the trade-off between communication efficiency and model performance in distributed deep learning by encouraging collaborative search for wide minima.

Method: Proposes the Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm, incorporating a lightweight regularizer based on the Inverse Mean Valley sharpness measure to balance consensus and exploration.

Result: DPPF outperforms other communication-efficient methods, achieves better generalization, reduces communication overhead, and locates flatter minima.

Conclusion: DPPF effectively balances pull-push dynamics, spans flat valleys, and provides theoretical guarantees for generalization and convergence in non-convex settings.

Abstract: We study centralized distributed data parallel training of deep neural
networks (DNNs), aiming to improve the trade-off between communication
efficiency and model performance of the local gradient methods. To this end, we
revisit the flat-minima hypothesis, which suggests that models with better
generalization tend to lie in flatter regions of the loss landscape. We
introduce a simple, yet effective, sharpness measure, Inverse Mean Valley, and
demonstrate its strong correlation with the generalization gap of DNNs. We
incorporate an efficient relaxation of this measure into the distributed
training objective as a lightweight regularizer that encourages workers to
collaboratively seek wide minima. The regularizer exerts a pushing force that
counteracts the consensus step pulling the workers together, giving rise to the
Distributed Pull-Push Force (DPPF) algorithm. Empirically, we show that DPPF
outperforms other communication-efficient approaches and achieves better
generalization performance than local gradient methods and synchronous gradient
averaging, while significantly reducing communication overhead. In addition,
our loss landscape visualizations confirm the ability of DPPF to locate flatter
minima. On the theoretical side, we show that DPPF guides workers to span flat
valleys, with the final valley width governed by the interplay between push and
pull strengths, and that its pull-push dynamics is self-stabilizing. We further
provide generalization guarantees linked to the valley width and prove
convergence in the non-convex setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Experimental DBP identification is costly and time-consuming, necessitating efficient computational prediction techniques.

Method: ResCap-DBP combines a residual learning-based encoder with a 1D-Capsule Network, using dilated convolutions and dynamic routing for feature extraction and hierarchical relationships.

Result: The model achieved high AUC scores (e.g., 98.0% on PDB14189) and balanced sensitivity/specificity across datasets, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Integrating global protein representations with advanced deep learning architectures enables reliable and scalable DBP prediction.

Abstract: DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) are integral to gene regulation and cellular
processes, making their accurate identification essential for understanding
biological functions and disease mechanisms. Experimental methods for DBP
identification are time-consuming and costly, driving the need for efficient
computational prediction techniques. In this study, we propose a novel deep
learning framework, ResCap-DBP, that combines a residual learning-based encoder
with a one-dimensional Capsule Network (1D-CapsNet) to predict DBPs directly
from raw protein sequences. Our architecture incorporates dilated convolutions
within residual blocks to mitigate vanishing gradient issues and extract rich
sequence features, while capsule layers with dynamic routing capture
hierarchical and spatial relationships within the learned feature space. We
conducted comprehensive ablation studies comparing global and local embeddings
from ProteinBERT and conventional one-hot encoding. Results show that
ProteinBERT embeddings substantially outperform other representations on large
datasets. Although one-hot encoding showed marginal advantages on smaller
datasets, such as PDB186, it struggled to scale effectively. Extensive
evaluations on four pairs of publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our model consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. It
achieved AUC scores of 98.0% and 89.5% on PDB14189andPDB1075, respectively. On
independent test sets PDB2272 and PDB186, the model attained top AUCs of 83.2%
and 83.3%, while maintaining competitive performance on larger datasets such as
PDB20000. Notably, the model maintains a well balanced sensitivity and
specificity across datasets. These results demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of integrating global protein representations with advanced
deep learning architectures for reliable and scalable DBP prediction in diverse
genomic contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in transfer learning like negative transfer and domain adaptation, especially in evolving domains like game development, to reduce inefficiency and costs.

Method: Uses visual frames and textual descriptions to create latent task representations, estimates environment similarity, and selects candidate policies for transfer.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with fewer training steps compared to learning-from-scratch methods in racing track experiments.

Conclusion: Embedding-driven task similarity estimation is effective for efficient transfer learning.

Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) offers the potential to accelerate learning by
transferring knowledge across tasks. However, it faces critical challenges such
as negative transfer, domain adaptation and inefficiency in selecting solid
source policies. These issues often represent critical problems in evolving
domains, i.e. game development, where scenarios transform and agents must
adapt. The continuous release of new agents is costly and inefficient. In this
work we challenge the key issues in TL to improve knowledge transfer, agents
performance across tasks and reduce computational costs. The proposed
methodology, called FAST - Framework for Adaptive Similarity-based Transfer,
leverages visual frames and textual descriptions to create a latent
representation of tasks dynamics, that is exploited to estimate similarity
between environments. The similarity scores guides our method in choosing
candidate policies from which transfer abilities to simplify learning of novel
tasks. Experimental results, over multiple racing tracks, demonstrate that FAST
achieves competitive final performance compared to learning-from-scratch
methods while requiring significantly less training steps. These findings
highlight the potential of embedding-driven task similarity estimations.

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformers perform in-context learning (ICL) for complex nonlinear regression tasks, analyzing attention dynamics and the role of the Lipschitz constant in convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance theoretical understanding of ICL beyond simple tasks, focusing on how transformers learn complex nonlinear functions.

Method: Analyzes stage-wise attention dynamics during training, introducing proof techniques to link Lipschitz constants to attention weight convergence.

Result: Attention to relevant features grows rapidly, while irrelevant features decay slowly. Convergence time depends on the Lipschitz constant, with distinct regimes for different L values.

Conclusion: Transformers consistently attend to relevant features at convergence, demonstrating ICL capability for unseen nonlinear functions.

Abstract: The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.

*Guanghui Zhu,Xin Fang,Lei Wang,Wenzhong Chen,Rong Gu,Chunfeng Yuan,Yihua Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOASF combines Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering to automate model selection and hyperparameter optimization, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-expert practitioners struggle with model selection and hyperparameter tuning due to lack of expertise.

Method: BOASF uses Bayesian Optimization for promising configurations and ASF to discard poor performers, with Softmax for resource allocation.

Result: BOASF speeds up optimization, outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and performs well under time constraints.

Conclusion: BOASF is effective for automating ML tasks, offering robust performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Machine learning has been making great success in many application areas.
However, for the non-expert practitioners, it is always very challenging to
address a machine learning task successfully and efficiently. Finding the
optimal machine learning model or the hyperparameter combination set from a
large number of possible alternatives usually requires considerable expert
knowledge and experience. To tackle this problem, we propose a combined
Bayesian Optimization and Adaptive Successive Filtering algorithm (BOASF) under
a unified multi-armed bandit framework to automate the model selection or the
hyperparameter optimization. Specifically, BOASF consists of multiple
evaluation rounds in each of which we select promising configurations for each
arm using the Bayesian optimization. Then, ASF can early discard the
poor-performed arms adaptively using a Gaussian UCB-based probabilistic model.
Furthermore, a Softmax model is employed to adaptively allocate available
resources for each promising arm that advances to the next round. The arm with
a higher probability of advancing will be allocated more resources.
Experimental results show that BOASF is effective for speeding up the model
selection and hyperparameter optimization processes while achieving robust and
better prediction performance than the existing state-of-the-art automatic
machine learning methods. Moreover, BOASF achieves better anytime performance
under various time budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WEEP is a novel, differentiable sparse regularizer that resolves the conflict between sparsity and gradient-based optimization, outperforming L1-norm and other non-convex regularizers in denoising tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dilemma of non-differentiable sparsity-inducing penalties conflicting with gradient-based optimizers motivates the need for a differentiable yet powerful sparse regularizer.

Method: WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty) is introduced, leveraging the weakly-convex envelope framework to ensure differentiability and L-smoothness.

Result: WEEP demonstrates superior performance in signal and image denoising compared to L1-norm and other non-convex regularizers.

Conclusion: WEEP successfully bridges the gap between statistical performance and computational tractability in sparse regularization.

Abstract: Sparse regularization is fundamental in signal processing for efficient
signal recovery and feature extraction. However, it faces a fundamental
dilemma: the most powerful sparsity-inducing penalties are often
non-differentiable, conflicting with gradient-based optimizers that dominate
the field. We introduce WEEP (Weakly-convex Envelope of Piecewise Penalty), a
novel, fully differentiable sparse regularizer derived from the weakly-convex
envelope framework. WEEP provides strong, unbiased sparsity while maintaining
full differentiability and L-smoothness, making it natively compatible with any
gradient-based optimizer. This resolves the conflict between statistical
performance and computational tractability. We demonstrate superior performance
compared to the L1-norm and other established non-convex sparse regularizers on
challenging signal and image denoising tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the robustness of various self-attention mechanisms (Softmax, Sigmoid, Linear, Doubly Stochastic, Cosine) in Vision Transformers against noise and spurious correlations.

Method: Tested attention variants on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenette datasets under different data corruption scenarios.

Conclusion: Doubly Stochastic attention is recommended for contexts with imperfect data.

Abstract: Self-attention mechanisms are foundational to Transformer architectures,
supporting their impressive success in a wide range of tasks. While there are

Linear, Doubly Stochastic, and Cosine attention within Vision Transformers
under different data corruption scenarios. Through testing across the CIFAR-10,

### [394] [Diagonally-Weighted Generalized Method of Moments Estimation for Gaussian Mixture Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20459)
*Liu Zhang,Oscar Mickelin,Sheng Xu,Amit Singer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DGMM, a diagonally-weighted GMM, to address computational and storage inefficiencies in MM and GMM for high-dimensional data. DGMM balances efficiency, complexity, and stability, outperforming MM and GMM in estimation errors and runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational and storage complexities of MM and GMM grow exponentially with data dimensions, making them impractical for high-dimensional data or higher-order moments. GMM's additional weighting matrix estimation exacerbates these issues.

Method: The authors propose DGMM, which avoids explicit computation or storage of moment tensors. They apply DGMM to weakly separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures, designing an efficient and stable algorithm.

Result: Empirical validation shows DGMM achieves smaller estimation errors and significantly shorter runtime compared to MM and GMM.

Conclusion: DGMM effectively addresses the bottlenecks of MM and GMM, offering a practical solution for high-dimensional data with improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Since Pearson [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. A,
185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling
data as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods
have proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)
improves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments
appropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of
MM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods
impractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are
required. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it
additionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these
bottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a
balance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical
stability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly
separated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a
computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the
DGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We
implement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of
DGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while
requiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM. The code and data will
be available upon publication at https://github.com/liu-lzhang/dgmm.

*Selahattin Akkas,Ariful Azad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shapley value-based graph sparsification improves GNN efficiency by preserving influential edges and removing misleading ones, maintaining predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph sparsification enhances GNN efficiency, but existing explainability methods with non-negative scores limit applicability. Shapley values offer a robust alternative.

Method: Uses Shapley values to assign positive and negative importance scores for edges, enabling better pruning strategies compared to gradient or perturbation-based methods.

Result: Shapley value-based sparsification reduces graph complexity while preserving predictive performance.

Conclusion: The approach enhances GNN interpretability and efficiency by leveraging Shapley values for sparsification.

Abstract: Graph sparsification is a key technique for improving inference efficiency in
Graph Neural Networks by removing edges with minimal impact on predictions. GNN
explainability methods generate local importance scores, which can be
aggregated into global scores for graph sparsification. However, many
explainability methods produce only non-negative scores, limiting their
applicability for sparsification. In contrast, Shapley value based methods
assign both positive and negative contributions to node predictions, offering a
theoretically robust and fair allocation of importance by evaluating many
subsets of graphs. Unlike gradient-based or perturbation-based explainers,
Shapley values enable better pruning strategies that preserve influential edges
while removing misleading or adversarial connections. Our approach shows that
Shapley value-based graph sparsification maintains predictive performance while
significantly reducing graph complexity, enhancing both interpretability and
efficiency in GNN inference.

### [396] [Conditional Diffusion Models for Global Precipitation Map Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20478)
*Daiko Kishikawa,Yuka Muto,Shunji Kotsuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using conditional diffusion models is proposed to complete incomplete satellite-based precipitation maps, outperforming traditional methods in spatio-temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete satellite precipitation data (e.g., GSMaP) due to orbital limitations and poor interpolation methods necessitates a better solution for global monitoring.

Method: Formulated as a video inpainting task, the method uses a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder, trained on ERA5 data (2020-2023) and evaluated on 2024 data.

Result: The approach produces more consistent inpainted precipitation maps than conventional methods.

Conclusion: Conditional diffusion models show promise for enhancing global precipitation monitoring.

Abstract: Incomplete satellite-based precipitation presents a significant challenge in
global monitoring. For example, the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation
(GSMaP) from JAXA suffers from substantial missing regions due to the orbital
characteristics of satellites that have microwave sensors, and its current
interpolation methods often result in spatial discontinuities. In this study,
we formulate the completion of the precipitation map as a video inpainting task
and propose a machine learning approach based on conditional diffusion models.
Our method employs a 3D U-Net with a 3D condition encoder to reconstruct
complete precipitation maps by leveraging spatio-temporal information from
infrared images, latitude-longitude grids, and physical time inputs. Training
was carried out on ERA5 hourly precipitation data from 2020 to 2023. We
generated a pseudo-GSMaP dataset by randomly applying GSMaP masks to ERA maps.
Performance was evaluated for the calendar year 2024, and our approach produces
more spatio-temporally consistent inpainted precipitation maps compared to
conventional methods. These results indicate the potential to improve global
precipitation monitoring using the conditional diffusion models.

*Yanheng Hou,Xunkai Li,Zhenjun Li,Bing Zhou,Ronghua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIAL introduces a native active learning framework for hypergraphs, addressing limitations of existing methods by leveraging high-order interactions and offering superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Graph Active Learning methods fail to preserve high-order structural information in hypergraphs, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: HIAL reformulates hypergraph active learning as an Influence Maximization task, using a dual-perspective influence function with a novel HOI-Aware propagation mechanism.

Result: HIAL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in performance, efficiency, generality, and robustness across seven datasets.

Conclusion: HIAL establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for active learning on hypergraphs, validated by theoretical guarantees and experiments.

Abstract: In recent years, Hypergraph Neural Networks (HNNs) have demonstrated immense
potential in handling complex systems with high-order interactions. However,
acquiring large-scale, high-quality labeled data for these models is costly,
making Active Learning (AL) a critical technique. Existing Graph Active
Learning (GAL) methods, when applied to hypergraphs, often rely on techniques
like "clique expansion," which destroys the high-order structural information
crucial to a hypergraph's success, thereby leading to suboptimal performance.
To address this challenge, we introduce HIAL (Hypergraph Active Learning), a
native active learning framework designed specifically for hypergraphs. We
innovatively reformulate the Hypergraph Active Learning (HAL) problem as an
Influence Maximization task. The core of HIAL is a dual-perspective influence
function that, based on our novel "High-Order Interaction-Aware (HOI-Aware)"
propagation mechanism, synergistically evaluates a node's feature-space
coverage (via Magnitude of Influence, MoI) and its topological influence (via
Expected Diffusion Value, EDV). We prove that this objective function is
monotone and submodular, thus enabling the use of an efficient greedy algorithm
with a formal (1-1/e) approximation guarantee. Extensive experiments on seven
public datasets demonstrate that HIAL significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of performance, efficiency, generality, and
robustness, establishing an efficient and powerful new paradigm for active
learning on hypergraphs.

*Enjun Du,Siyi Liu,Yongqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoKGR is a framework for KG reasoning that adaptively selects and weights path lengths and prunes paths based on query complexity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs use rigid path-exploration strategies, limiting adaptability to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances.

Method: MoKGR uses a mixture-of-experts framework with length and pruning experts to personalize path exploration.

Result: MoKGR shows superior performance in transductive and inductive settings.

Conclusion: Personalized path exploration enhances KG reasoning effectiveness.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning, which aims to infer new facts from structured
knowledge repositories, plays a vital role in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
systems. Its effectiveness critically depends on constructing informative and
contextually relevant reasoning paths. However, existing graph neural networks
(GNNs) often adopt rigid, query-agnostic path-exploration strategies, limiting
their ability to adapt to diverse linguistic contexts and semantic nuances. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MoKGR}, a mixture-of-experts
framework that personalizes path exploration through two complementary
components: (1) a mixture of length experts that adaptively selects and weights
candidate path lengths according to query complexity, providing query-specific
reasoning depth; and (2) a mixture of pruning experts that evaluates candidate
paths from a complementary perspective, retaining the most informative paths
for each query. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmark, MoKGR
demonstrates superior performance in both transductive and inductive settings,
validating the effectiveness of personalized path exploration in KGs reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DmC is a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target data, using k-NN for domain proximity and a diffusion model to enhance source samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for cross-domain offline RL require large target datasets, which are impractical. DmC addresses this by tackling dataset imbalance and partial domain overlap.

Method: DmC uses k-NN for domain proximity estimation and a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate better-aligned source samples.

Result: DmC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in MuJoCo environments, showing significant performance gains.

Conclusion: DmC effectively addresses challenges in cross-domain offline RL with limited target data, improving policy learning through better-aligned source samples.

Abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to enhance sample
efficiency in offline RL by utilizing additional offline source datasets. A key
challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to
the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring
domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or
mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods
often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world
scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited
target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,
which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to
overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in
uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset
of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these
issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with
limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor
($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network
training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain
proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate
additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus
enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,
we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain
offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.

### [400] [Customize Multi-modal RAI Guardrails with Precedent-based predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20503)
*Cheng-Fu Yang,Thanh Tran,Christos Christodoulopoulos,Weitong Ruan,Rahul Gupta,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable and adaptable multi-modal guardrail system uses precedents (reasoning processes of similar data) instead of fixed policies to filter content, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guardrails struggle with customization, scalability, and adaptability to new policies without extensive retraining.

Method: Proposes a critique-revise mechanism for collecting precedents and two strategies to use them for robust predictions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods in few-shot and full-dataset scenarios, with better generalization to new policies.

Conclusion: Leveraging precedents enhances flexibility and adaptability, making the guardrail more effective for real-world applications.

Abstract: A multi-modal guardrail must effectively filter image content based on
user-defined policies, identifying material that may be hateful, reinforce
harmful stereotypes, contain explicit material, or spread misinformation.
Deploying such guardrails in real-world applications, however, poses
significant challenges. Users often require varied and highly customizable
policies and typically cannot provide abundant examples for each custom policy.
Consequently, an ideal guardrail should be scalable to the multiple policies
and adaptable to evolving user standards with minimal retraining. Existing
fine-tuning methods typically condition predictions on pre-defined policies,
restricting their generalizability to new policies or necessitating extensive
retraining to adapt. Conversely, training-free methods struggle with limited
context lengths, making it difficult to incorporate all the policies
comprehensively. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition model's
judgment on "precedents", which are the reasoning processes of prior data
points similar to the given input. By leveraging precedents instead of fixed
policies, our approach greatly enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the
guardrail. In this paper, we introduce a critique-revise mechanism for
collecting high-quality precedents and two strategies that utilize precedents
for robust prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms previous methods across both few-shot and full-dataset scenarios
and exhibits superior generalization to novel policies.

TL;DR: MPCCL is a novel graph clustering model addressing long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss via multi-scale coarsening and contrastive learning, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture high-order graph features, suffer from feature diversity loss, and lose fine-grained structural details during coarsening.

Method: MPCCL uses multi-scale coarsening with global node similarity and one-to-many contrastive learning, integrating node embeddings with augmented views and centroids.

Result: MPCCL improves clustering performance, e.g., 15.24% NMI increase on ACM and robust gains on Citeseer, Cora, and DBLP.

Conclusion: MPCCL effectively bridges gaps in graph clustering by preserving structural details and enhancing feature diversity, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: This study introduces the Multi-Scale Weight-Based Pairwise Coarsening and
Contrastive Learning (MPCCL) model, a novel approach for attributed graph
clustering that effectively bridges critical gaps in existing methods,
including long-range dependency, feature collapse, and information loss.
Traditional methods often struggle to capture high-order graph features due to
their reliance on low-order attribute information, while contrastive learning
techniques face limitations in feature diversity by overemphasizing local
neighborhood structures. Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,
though reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.
MPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening
strategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the
merging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential
structural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive
learning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and
cluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature
masking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during
multi-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL
divergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures
cross-scale consistency of node representations. Experimental evaluations
reveal that MPCCL achieves a significant improvement in clustering performance,
including a remarkable 15.24% increase in NMI on the ACM dataset and notable
robust gains on smaller-scale datasets such as Citeseer, Cora and DBLP.

Motivation: Traditional ray tracing is computationally intensive due to sequential surface-by-surface calculations.

Method: Ray2Ray learns the mapping between input and output rays using neural representations, trained on nine optical systems.

Result: Achieves positional errors of ~1µm and angular deviations of ~0.01 degrees.

Conclusion: Neural representations can effectively replace traditional optical raytracing methods.

Abstract: Ray tracing is a widely used technique for modeling optical systems,
involving sequential surface-by-surface computations, which can be
computationally intensive. We propose Ray2Ray, a novel method that leverages
implicit neural representations to model optical systems with greater
efficiency, eliminating the need for surface-by-surface computations in a
single pass end-to-end model. Ray2Ray learns the mapping between rays emitted
from a given source and their corresponding rays after passing through a given
optical system in a physically accurate manner. We train Ray2Ray on nine
off-the-shelf optical systems, achieving positional errors on the order of
1{\mu}m and angular deviations on the order 0.01 degrees in the estimated
output rays. Our work highlights the potential of neural representations as a
proxy for optical raytracer.

TL;DR: KOBO introduces a method to optimize Gaussian Process kernels using a variational autoencoder, reducing sample budgets in black box optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the sample budget in black box optimization by learning the function's kernel structure.

Method: Creates a continuous kernel space in a variational autoencoder's latent space and uses auxiliary optimization to find the best kernel.

Result: KOBO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving optimal results with fewer samples in synthetic and real-world applications.

Conclusion: KOBO is effective for optimizing functions with limited samples, applicable in areas like hearing aid personalization and generative models.

Abstract: Black box optimization (BBO) focuses on optimizing unknown functions in
high-dimensional spaces. In many applications, sampling the unknown function is
expensive, imposing a tight sample budget. Ongoing work is making progress on
reducing the sample budget by learning the shape/structure of the function,
known as kernel learning. We propose a new method to learn the kernel of a
Gaussian Process. Our idea is to create a continuous kernel space in the latent
space of a variational autoencoder, and run an auxiliary optimization to
identify the best kernel. Results show that the proposed method, Kernel
Optimized Blackbox Optimization (KOBO), outperforms state of the art by
estimating the optimal at considerably lower sample budgets. Results hold not
only across synthetic benchmark functions but also in real applications. We
show that a hearing aid may be personalized with fewer audio queries to the
user, or a generative model could converge to desirable images from limited
user ratings.

loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training
process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a
joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its

  Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking

Tau2-Bench, 76.5 on ACEBench (En), 65.8 on SWE-Bench Verified, and 47.3 on
SWE-Bench Multilingual -- surpassing most open and closed-sourced baselines in
non-thinking settings. It also exhibits strong capabilities in coding,
mathematics, and reasoning tasks, with a score of 53.7 on LiveCodeBench v6,
49.5 on AIME 2025, 75.1 on GPQA-Diamond, and 27.1 on OJBench, all without
extended thinking. These results position Kimi K2 as one of the most capable
open-source large language models to date, particularly in software engineering
and agentic tasks. We release our base and post-trained model checkpoints to
facilitate future research and applications of agentic intelligence.

*Dawon Ahn,Jun-Gi Jang,Evangelos E. Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAFF improves group fairness in tensor decomposition by minimizing error gaps between groups while reducing overall completion error, achieving better performance than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in existing group fairness methods for tensor decomposition to prevent discrimination based on social grounds like gender or age.

Method: Proposes STAFF, which augments tensors with additional entities to mitigate imbalance and bias, evaluated under conventional and deep learning-based models.

Result: STAFF achieves up to 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the second-best baseline, balancing completion error and fairness.

Conclusion: STAFF effectively enhances fairness in tensor decomposition without compromising performance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Group fairness is important to consider in tensor decomposition to prevent
discrimination based on social grounds such as gender or age. Although few
works have studied group fairness in tensor decomposition, they suffer from
performance degradation. To address this, we propose STAFF(Sparse Tensor
Augmentation For Fairness) to improve group fairness by minimizing the gap in
completion errors of different groups while reducing the overall tensor
completion error. Our main idea is to augment a tensor with augmented entities
including sufficient observed entries to mitigate imbalance and group bias in
the sparse tensor. We evaluate \method on tensor completion with various
datasets under conventional and deep learning-based tensor models. STAFF
consistently shows the best trade-off between completion error and group
fairness; at most, it yields 36% lower MSE and 59% lower MADE than the
second-best baseline.

*Shuaipeng Zhang,Lanju Kong,Yixin Zhang,Wei He,Yongqing Zheng,Han Yu,Lizhen Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DAG-AFL, a blockchain-based FL framework using DAG to improve efficiency and accuracy while reducing resource overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in FL like model vulnerability, coordination, and resource consumption, exacerbated by asynchronous client participation and data heterogeneity.

Method: Introduces DAG-AFL with a tip selection algorithm for temporal freshness, node reachability, and model accuracy, plus a DAG-based trusted verification strategy.

Result: Outperforms 8 state-of-the-art methods, improving training efficiency by 22.7% and model accuracy by 6.5% on average.

Conclusion: DAG-AFL effectively balances FL efficiency and security with minimal resource overhead, making it suitable for wireless, resource-limited devices.

Abstract: Due to the distributed nature of federated learning (FL), the vulnerability
of the global model and the need for coordination among many client devices
pose significant challenges. As a promising decentralized, scalable and secure
solution, blockchain-based FL methods have attracted widespread attention in
recent years. However, traditional consensus mechanisms designed for Proof of
Work (PoW) similar to blockchain incur substantial resource consumption and
compromise the efficiency of FL, particularly when participating devices are
wireless and resource-limited. To address asynchronous client participation and
data heterogeneity in FL, while limiting the additional resource overhead
introduced by blockchain, we propose the Directed Acyclic Graph-based
Asynchronous Federated Learning (DAG-AFL) framework. We develop a tip selection
algorithm that considers temporal freshness, node reachability and model
accuracy, with a DAG-based trusted verification strategy. Extensive experiments
on 3 benchmarking datasets against eight state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate that DAG-AFL significantly improves training efficiency and model
accuracy by 22.7% and 6.5% on average, respectively.

### [407] [Reminiscence Attack on Residuals: Exploiting Approximate Machine Unlearning for Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20573)
*Yaxin Xiao,Qingqing Ye,Li Hu,Huadi Zheng,Haibo Hu,Zi Liang,Haoyang Li,Yijie Jiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine unlearning methods fail to fully protect privacy due to implicit residuals, enabling new attacks like ReA. A dual-phase framework mitigates this risk effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy risks in approximate unlearning methods, which leave residuals exposing unlearned data to attacks.

Method: Proposes the Reminiscence Attack (ReA) to exploit residuals and a dual-phase unlearning framework to eliminate traces and ensure convergence stability.

Result: ReA outperforms prior attacks, while the framework reduces attack accuracy to near random guess with low computational overhead.

Conclusion: The dual-phase framework effectively mitigates residual-induced privacy risks in machine unlearning.

Abstract: Machine unlearning enables the removal of specific data from ML models to
uphold the right to be forgotten. While approximate unlearning algorithms offer
efficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to
adequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these
algorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks
targeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless
of model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new
attack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,
we propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation
between residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning
processes. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior
attacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively. To
mitigate such residual-induced privacy risk, we develop a dual-phase
approximate unlearning framework that first eliminates deep-layer unlearned
data traces and then enforces convergence stability to prevent models from
"pseudo-convergence", where their outputs are similar to retrained models but
still preserve unlearned residuals. Our framework works for both classification
and generation tasks. Experimental evaluations confirm that our approach
maintains high unlearning efficacy, while reducing the adaptive privacy attack
accuracy to nearly random guess, at the computational cost of 2-12% of full
retraining from scratch.

*Ansh Poonia,Maeghal Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how assigning personas to LLMs affects their reasoning, revealing early MLP layers process both syntax and semantics, while middle MHA layers shape outputs using persona-specific representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how personas influence LLMs' reasoning and identify key model components encoding persona-specific information.

Method: Used activation patching to analyze how MLP and MHA layers process persona tokens and influence outputs.

Result: Early MLP layers handle syntax and semantics, transforming personas into richer representations; middle MHA layers use these to shape outputs. Specific attention heads focus on racial and color-based identities.

Conclusion: Personas impact LLM reasoning through early MLP and middle MHA layers, with some attention heads highlighting biases toward racial and color identities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable versatility in adopting
diverse personas. In this study, we examine how assigning a persona influences
a model's reasoning on an objective task. Using activation patching, we take a
first step toward understanding how key components of the model encode
persona-specific information. Our findings reveal that the early Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) layers attend not only to the syntactic structure of the input
but also process its semantic content. These layers transform persona tokens
into richer representations, which are then used by the middle Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) layers to shape the model's output. Additionally, we identify
specific attention heads that disproportionately attend to racial and
color-based identities.

### [409] [Fusing CFD and measurement data using transfer learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20576)
*Alexander Barklage,Philipp Bekemeyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network-based method combines simulation and measurement data via transfer learning, outperforming linear methods like proper orthogonal decomposition for aerodynamic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerodynamic analysis methods vary in accuracy and resolution; a data-driven model combining their advantages is needed.

Method: A neural network is trained on high-resolution simulation data, then fine-tuned with sparse but accurate measurement data using transfer learning.

Result: The method improves accuracy near nonlinearities and provides solutions for arbitrary flow conditions, aiding design and certification.

Conclusion: The approach is generalizable to complex architectures and enhances aerodynamic analysis by leveraging data fusion.

Abstract: Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between search space exploration and efficiency in NAS, especially for complex tasks, by overcoming static search strategies and ambiguous representations in LLM-based methods.

Method: Uses dynamic phase transitions guided by real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for consistent code generation.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy and better rank on NAS-Bench-Macro, reduces search time by up to 86% for CIFAR-10/100, and produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost.

Conclusion: PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS across diverse vision tasks.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is challenged by the trade-off between
search space exploration and efficiency, especially for complex tasks. While
recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static
search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose
PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by
real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for
consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS
consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For
image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86%
while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically
produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results
demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS
across diverse vision tasks.

### [411] [LoRA-PAR: A Flexible Dual-System LoRA Partitioning Approach to Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20999)
*Yining Huang,Bin Li,Keke Tang,Meilian Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA-PAR is a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions data and parameters for System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (deliberative) tasks, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods lack explicit tailoring for different response demands (intuitive vs. logical). Inspired by 'Thinking, Fast and Slow,' the paper aims to optimize parameter usage by aligning them with task-specific needs.

Method: Classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, partition parameters by importance scoring, and use a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: SFT for System 1 tasks and RL for System 2 tasks.

Result: The two-stage fine-tuning strategy reduces active parameter usage while matching or surpassing state-of-the-art PEFT baselines.

Conclusion: LoRA-PAR effectively balances efficiency and performance by aligning parameter usage with task demands, offering a scalable solution for large-scale generative models.

Abstract: Large-scale generative models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O1 benefit
substantially from chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet pushing their
performance typically requires vast data, large model sizes, and full-parameter
fine-tuning. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost,
most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise
allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different
response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes
two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and
System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that
different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for
tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step
logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework
that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using
fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task
data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on
importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training
System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and
intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to
reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the
two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while
matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.

*Julia Siekiera,Christian Schlötterer,Stefan Kramer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep generative neural network is introduced to model allele frequency trajectories in E&R experiments, addressing limitations of classic models and improving LD estimation in Pool-Seq data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classic statistical models like the Wright-Fisher model have simplified assumptions and uncertainties. Deep generative models offer a powerful alternative but face challenges in data demands and interpretability in population genomics.

Method: The proposed deep generative neural network models allele frequency trajectories by embedding SNP observations with neighboring loci information, validated on simulated E&R experiments.

Result: The model captures allele frequency distributions and demonstrates competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data, even in high-LD scenarios.

Conclusion: The deep generative model effectively addresses challenges in E&R experiments, providing accurate LD estimation and leveraging learned representations for insights typically inaccessible in Pool-Seq data.

Abstract: The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.

*Filip de Roos,Fabio Muratore*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores novel pivoting strategies for Cholesky decomposition, linking it to Bayesian nonparametric inference, and demonstrates improved efficiency in Gaussian process tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the numerical stability and efficiency of Cholesky decomposition by leveraging connections to Bayesian nonparametric inference.

Method: Introduces new pivoting strategies inspired by greedy entropy maximization, tailored for Cholesky decomposition.

Result: The proposed strategies outperform traditional baselines in sparse regression and iterative solver tasks with minimal extra computation.

Conclusion: The novel pivoting strategies improve Cholesky decomposition efficiency, particularly in Gaussian process applications.

Abstract: The Cholesky decomposition is a fundamental tool for solving linear systems
with symmetric and positive definite matrices which are ubiquitous in linear
algebra, optimization, and machine learning. Its numerical stability can be
improved by introducing a pivoting strategy that iteratively permutes the rows
and columns of the matrix. The order of pivoting indices determines how
accurately the intermediate decomposition can reconstruct the original matrix,
thus is decisive for the algorithm's efficiency in the case of early
termination. Standard implementations select the next pivot from the largest
value on the diagonal. In the case of Bayesian nonparametric inference, this
strategy corresponds to greedy entropy maximization, which is often used in
active learning and design of experiments. We explore this connection in detail
and deduce novel pivoting strategies for the Cholesky decomposition. The
resulting algorithms are more efficient at reducing the uncertainty over a data
set, can be updated to include information about observations, and additionally
benefit from a tailored implementation. We benchmark the effectiveness of the
new selection strategies on two tasks important to Gaussian processes: sparse
regression and inference based on preconditioned iterative solvers. Our results
show that the proposed selection strategies are either on par or, in most
cases, outperform traditional baselines while requiring a negligible amount of
additional computation.

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to manipulate data samples to artificially meet fairness criteria and how to detect such manipulations, offering tools for auditors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring AI compliance with regulations like the EU AI Act requires fairness audits, but current metrics like Disparate Impact can be gamed.

Method: Uses entropic or optimal transport projections to modify data distributions under fairness constraints, then analyzes detection methods.

Result: Validated methods for data manipulation and detection on classical datasets, revealing vulnerabilities in fairness audits.

Conclusion: Provides tools to detect manipulated fairness compliance and recommendations for auditors to improve inspection robustness.

Abstract: Proving the compliance of AI algorithms has become an important challenge
with the growing deployment of such algorithms for real-life applications.
Inspecting possible biased behaviors is mandatory to satisfy the constraints of
the regulations of the EU Artificial Intelligence's Act. Regulation-driven
audits increasingly rely on global fairness metrics, with Disparate Impact
being the most widely used. Yet such global measures depend highly on the
distribution of the sample on which the measures are computed. We investigate
first how to manipulate data samples to artificially satisfy fairness criteria,
creating minimally perturbed datasets that remain statistically
indistinguishable from the original distribution while satisfying prescribed
fairness constraints. Then we study how to detect such manipulation. Our
analysis (i) introduces mathematically sound methods for modifying empirical
distributions under fairness constraints using entropic or optimal transport
projections, (ii) examines how an auditee could potentially circumvent fairness
inspections, and (iii) offers recommendations to help auditors detect such data
manipulations. These results are validated through experiments on classical
tabular datasets in bias detection.

Motivation: Prostate cancer diagnosis lacks advanced tools; the study aims to improve accuracy and interpretability using multimodal AI.

Method: Combines BERT for textual clinical notes and Random Forest for numerical lab data with a novel fusion strategy.

Result: Achieves 98% accuracy, 99% AUC, and improved recall (0.900) for intermediate stages. SHAP analysis ensures interpretability.

Conclusion: The system balances performance, efficiency, and interpretability, addressing critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics.

Abstract: Prostate cancer, the second most prevalent male malignancy, requires advanced
diagnostic tools. We propose an explainable AI system combining BERT (for
textual clinical notes) and Random Forest (for numerical lab data) through a
novel multimodal fusion strategy, achieving superior classification performance
on PLCO-NIH dataset (98% accuracy, 99% AUC). While multimodal fusion is
established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF
pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for
intermediate cancer stages (Class 2/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824
numerical/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance
rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value.
This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UEC improves NLP embedding ensembles by incorporating model uncertainty, enhancing performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ensemble methods for text embeddings ignore model-specific uncertainty, limiting robustness.

Method: UEC transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones, computes adaptive weights based on uncertainty, and introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function.

Result: UEC consistently improves performance and robustness in retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity tasks.

Conclusion: UEC's principled uncertainty modeling enhances embedding ensembles, making them more reliable for downstream applications.

Abstract: Text embeddings are essential components in modern NLP pipelines. While
numerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across
domains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks. This
variability motivates the use of ensemble techniques to combine complementary
strengths. However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic
embeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their
robustness and reliability in downstream applications. To address these
limitations, we propose Uncertainty-driven Embedding Convolution (UEC). UEC
first transforms deterministic embeddings into probabilistic ones in a post-hoc
manner. It then computes adaptive ensemble weights based on embedding
uncertainty, grounded in a Bayes-optimal solution under a surrogate loss.
Additionally, UEC introduces an uncertainty-aware similarity function that
directly incorporates uncertainty into similarity scoring. Extensive
experiments on retrieval, classification, and semantic similarity benchmarks
demonstrate that UEC consistently improves both performance and robustness by
leveraging principled uncertainty modeling.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes token-level hallucination signals in foundational models, finding the first hallucinated token is more detectable than conditional tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding token-level hallucination signals is crucial for real-time filtering and correction in foundational models.

Method: The study uses the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and reproduced logits to analyze hallucination signals.

Result: The first hallucinated token carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens.

Conclusion: The findings improve understanding of token-level hallucination, with tools and code released for further research.

Abstract: Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Buildings with similar features share energy patterns, but conventional methods fail to capture spatial dependencies in operational data.

Method: A graph is constructed using building characteristics and environmental factors, followed by a multi-level graph convolutional architecture with attention for prediction, and a method to interpret the graph structure.

Result: The method outperforms baselines (XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, Naive) on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset, demonstrating robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively captures spatial relationships and building similarities, offering superior performance and interpretability in energy load prediction.

Abstract: Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.

Motivation: Deep clustering for time series lacks transparency, limiting its use in safety-critical applications. This survey aims to organize and evaluate current methods to address this gap.

Method: The survey reviews peer-reviewed and preprint papers, comparing methods and applications in healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Focus is on autoencoder and attention architectures.

Result: Most methods lack support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or privacy-preserved data. Interpretability is often treated as an afterthought.

Conclusion: The field needs to prioritize interpretability as a design goal. Six research opportunities are outlined to improve trustworthiness and usability in deep clustering for time series.

Abstract: Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.

*Saket Tiwari,Omer Gottesman,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a geometric approach to understand the attainable states in RL for continuous spaces, linking state space geometry to action space dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most theoretical RL work focuses on finite spaces, leaving continuous spaces less understood. This paper aims to bridge that gap.

Method: Uses a geometric lens to analyze attainable states, focusing on a two-layer neural policy trained with actor-critic. Proves dimensionality bounds.

Result: Shows attainable states form a low-dimensional manifold linked to action space dimensionality, empirically validated in MuJoCo and toy environments.

Conclusion: Introduces a manifold learning layer to improve performance in high-dimensional control tasks, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to its successful
application in complex tasks with continuous state and action spaces. Despite
these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and
action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous
state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally
attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a
semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show
that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low
dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional
nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,
under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order
of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its
kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the
action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo
environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying
dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by
introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function
networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high
degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse
representations.

*Shomoita Jahid Mitin,Rodrigue Rizk,Maximilian Scherer,Thomas Koeglsperger,Daniel Lench,KC Santosh,Arun Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-modal model using EEG and clinical data improves detection of gait dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait (FOG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for detecting gait dysfunction in PD are subjective or require specialized tools, necessitating an objective, scalable solution.

Method: A Bi-cephalic Self-Attention Model (BiSAM) was trained on resting-state EEG signals and demographic/clinical data from 124 participants (PD with/without FOG and healthy controls). Three modalities were tested: signal-only, descriptive-only, and multi-modal.

Result: Multi-modal models (BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4) achieved 88% accuracy, outperforming signal-only (55%) and descriptive-only (68%) models.

Conclusion: Integrating EEG with descriptive features provides robust, scalable detection of PD-related gait dysfunction, offering clinical potential for early diagnosis and monitoring.

Abstract: Parkinson Disease (PD) often results in motor and cognitive impairments,
including gait dysfunction, particularly in patients with freezing of gait
(FOG). Current detection methods are either subjective or reliant on
specialized gait analysis tools. This study aims to develop an objective,
data-driven, and multi-modal classification model to detect gait dysfunction in
PD patients using resting-state EEG signals combined with demographic and
clinical variables. We utilized a dataset of 124 participants: 42 PD patients
with FOG (PDFOG+), 41 without FOG (PDFOG-), and 41 age-matched healthy
controls. Features extracted from resting-state EEG and descriptive variables
(age, education, disease duration) were used to train a novel Bi-cephalic
Self-Attention Model (BiSAM). We tested three modalities: signal-only,
descriptive-only, and multi-modal, across different EEG channel subsets
(BiSAM-63, -16, -8, and -4). Signal-only and descriptive-only models showed
limited performance, achieving a maximum accuracy of 55% and 68%, respectively.
In contrast, the multi-modal models significantly outperformed both, with
BiSAM-8 and BiSAM-4 achieving the highest classification accuracy of 88%. These
results demonstrate the value of integrating EEG with objective descriptive
features for robust PDFOG+ detection. This study introduces a multi-modal,
attention-based architecture that objectively classifies PDFOG+ using minimal
EEG channels and descriptive variables. This approach offers a scalable and
efficient alternative to traditional assessments, with potential applications
in routine clinical monitoring and early diagnosis of PD-related gait
dysfunction.

*Lara Neves,Afonso Lourenço,Alberto Cano,Goreti Marreiros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iHOMER is an online multi-label learning framework that dynamically clusters labels and adapts to concept drift, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-label data streams like evolving distributions, high-dimensional labels, and concept drift.

Method: Uses incremental divisive-agglomerative clustering and a global tree-based learner with drift detection.

Result: Outperforms 5 global baselines by 23% and 12 local baselines by 32%.

Conclusion: iHOMER is robust for online multi-label classification.

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

*Aman Shukla,Daniel Patrick Scantlebury,Rishabh Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LANTERN is a modular architecture for user behavior modeling, combining survey data with contextual signals to improve prediction accuracy while maintaining survey primacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surveys alone are limited by user fatigue and incomplete responses, necessitating a method to enhance behavioral data modeling.

Method: LANTERN uses selective gating, residual connections, and late fusion via cross-attention to fuse survey responses with contextual signals.

Result: LANTERN outperforms survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction and shows benefits in selective modality reliance.

Conclusion: LANTERN offers a scalable, extensible solution for behavior modeling in survey-centric applications.

Abstract: Modeling user behavior is critical across many industries where understanding
preferences, intent, or decisions informs personalization, targeting, and
strategic outcomes. Surveys have long served as a classical mechanism for
collecting such behavioral data due to their interpretability, structure, and
ease of deployment. However, surveys alone are inherently limited by user
fatigue, incomplete responses, and practical constraints on their length making
them insufficient for capturing user behavior. In this work, we present LANTERN
(Late-Attentive Network for Enriched Response Modeling), a modular architecture
for modeling user behavior by fusing adaptive survey responses with
supplemental contextual signals. We demonstrate the architectural value of
maintaining survey primacy through selective gating, residual connections and
late fusion via cross-attention, treating survey data as the primary signal
while incorporating external modalities only when relevant. LANTERN outperforms
strong survey-only baselines in multi-label prediction of survey responses. We
further investigate threshold sensitivity and the benefits of selective
modality reliance through ablation and rare/frequent attribute analysis.
LANTERN's modularity supports scalable integration of new encoders and evolving
datasets. This work provides a practical and extensible blueprint for behavior
modeling in survey-centric applications.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Zhonglie Liu,Kun Meng,Jiameng Chen,Jia Wu,Bo Du,Di Lin,Yan Che,Wenbin Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a novel zero-shot CPI prediction method using subsequence reordering and protein augmentation to address challenges in representation learning and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing CPI prediction methods, such as overlooking subsequence interdependencies and reliance on large datasets.

Method: Pretrains protein representations using subsequence reordering and applies length-variable protein augmentation for small datasets.

Result: Improves baseline model performance, especially in zero-shot scenarios, and outperforms existing pre-training models in data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses key challenges in CPI prediction, offering scalability and efficiency in real-world drug development.

Abstract: Given the vastness of chemical space and the ongoing emergence of previously
uncharacterized proteins, zero-shot compound-protein interaction (CPI)
prediction better reflects the practical challenges and requirements of
real-world drug development. Although existing methods perform adequately
during certain CPI tasks, they still face the following challenges: (1)
Representation learning from local or complete protein sequences often
overlooks the complex interdependencies between subsequences, which are
essential for predicting spatial structures and binding properties. (2)
Dependence on large-scale or scarce multimodal protein datasets demands
significant training data and computational resources, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
pretrains protein representations for CPI prediction tasks using subsequence
reordering, explicitly capturing the dependencies between protein subsequences.
Furthermore, we apply length-variable protein augmentation to ensure excellent
pretraining performance on small training datasets. To evaluate the model's
effectiveness and zero-shot learning ability, we combine it with various
baseline methods. The results demonstrate that our approach can improve the
baseline model's performance on the CPI task, especially in the challenging
zero-shot scenario. Compared to existing pre-training models, our model
demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-scarce scenarios where
training samples are limited. Our implementation is available at

*Wei Shan Lee,Chi Kiu Althina Chau,Kei Chon Sio,Kam Ian Leong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid Fourier-neural architecture breaks the precision ceiling of PINNs for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving ultra-low L2 errors and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the perceived precision limit of PINNs (errors of $10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$) for fourth-order PDEs, particularly in engineering applications.

Method: Combines a truncated Fourier series (capturing dominant modes) with a deep neural network (adaptive residuals), optimized via a two-phase strategy (Adam + L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing.

Result: Achieves unprecedented L2 error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$, 17x better than standard PINNs and 15-500x better than traditional methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates ultra-precision is achievable with proper design, bridging gaps in existing approaches and opening new paradigms for scientific computing.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have plateaued at errors of
$10^{-3}$-$10^{-4}$ for fourth-order partial differential equations, creating a
perceived precision ceiling that limits their adoption in engineering
applications. We break through this barrier with a hybrid Fourier-neural
architecture for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, achieving unprecedented L2
error of $1.94 \times 10^{-7}$-a 17-fold improvement over standard PINNs and
\(15-500\times\) better than traditional numerical methods. Our approach
synergistically combines a truncated Fourier series capturing dominant modal
behavior with a deep neural network providing adaptive residual corrections. A
systematic harmonic optimization study revealed a counter-intuitive discovery:
exactly 10 harmonics yield optimal performance, with accuracy catastrophically
degrading from $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-1}$ beyond this threshold. The two-phase
optimization strategy (Adam followed by L-BFGS) and adaptive weight balancing
enable stable ultra-precision convergence. GPU-accelerated implementation
achieves sub-30-minute training despite fourth-order derivative complexity. By
addressing 12 critical gaps in existing approaches-from architectural rigidity
to optimization landscapes-this work demonstrates that ultra-precision is
achievable through proper design, opening new paradigms for scientific
computing where machine learning can match or exceed traditional numerical
methods.

TL;DR: ProvCreator is a synthetic graph framework for complex heterogeneous graphs, using transformer-based models to generate realistic and privacy-aware datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on simple homogeneous graphs, lacking relevance for real-world applications with complex schemas.

Method: ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation task, using a graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder for lossless encoding, compression, and learnable generation.

Result: ProvCreator successfully generates realistic synthetic graphs for cybersecurity provenance and knowledge graphs, capturing structure-semantics dependencies.

Conclusion: ProvCreator advances synthetic graph generation for complex, heterogeneous graphs, offering practical utility in domains like cybersecurity and knowledge graphs.

Abstract: The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.

*Rongyao Cai,Ming Jin,Qingsong Wen,Kexin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARSD is a novel UDA framework addressing domain shift in time series by decomposing representations into transferable and domain-specific parts, outperforming 12 existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in time series causes models to fail when applied to target domains with different distributions. Current UDA methods ignore intrinsic feature compositions.

Method: DARSD decomposes representations into domain-invariant and specific parts using adversarial learning, pseudo-labeling, and contrastive optimization.

Result: DARSD outperforms 12 UDA methods, achieving top performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios on four datasets.

Conclusion: DARSD effectively addresses domain shift by disentangling transferable knowledge, offering a theoretically explainable and superior UDA solution.

Abstract: Domain shift poses a fundamental challenge in time series analysis, where
models trained on source domain often fail dramatically when applied in target
domain with different yet similar distributions. While current unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods attempt to align cross-domain feature
distributions, they typically treat features as indivisible entities, ignoring
their intrinsic compositions that governs domain adaptation. We introduce
DARSD, a novel UDA framework with theoretical explainability that explicitly
realizes UDA tasks from the perspective of representation space decomposition.
Our core insight is that effective domain adaptation requires not just
alignment, but principled disentanglement of transferable knowledge from mixed
representations. DARSD consists three synergistic components: (I) An
adversarial learnable common invariant basis that projects original features
into a domain-invariant subspace while preserving semantic content; (II) A
prototypical pseudo-labeling mechanism that dynamically separates target
features based on confidence, hindering error accumulation; (III) A hybrid
contrastive optimization strategy that simultaneously enforces feature
clustering and consistency while mitigating emerging distribution gaps.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets (WISDM, HAR,
HHAR, and MFD) demonstrate DARSD's superiority against 12 UDA algorithms,
achieving optimal performance in 35 out of 53 cross-domain scenarios.

TL;DR: SAE Debias is a lightweight, model-agnostic framework using a k-sparse autoencoder to mitigate gender bias in T2I models by identifying and suppressing biased directions in the latent space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing gender bias in T2I diffusion models, which often generate stereotypical associations between professions and genders.

Method: Uses a pre-trained k-sparse autoencoder to identify gender-relevant directions in the latent space and suppresses these directions during inference.

Result: Effectively reduces gender bias across multiple T2I models (e.g., Stable Diffusion variants) without compromising generation quality.

Conclusion: SAE Debias offers an interpretable, reusable, and model-agnostic solution for fairer T2I generation, advancing socially responsible AI.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly
by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered
subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic
framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require
model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates
directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural
modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender
bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the
sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased
direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed
during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.
Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing
direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased
subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially
reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying
and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute
toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable
and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: SmallThinker is a family of LLMs designed for local devices, overcoming computational, memory, and storage constraints with innovative architecture and co-designed inference, achieving high performance on consumer CPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLM deployment on local devices with weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage, challenging the reliance on GPU-powered cloud infrastructure.

Method: Introduces a deployment-aware architecture with a two-level sparse structure (MoE + sparse feed-forward networks), a pre-attention router for I/O efficiency, and NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention for memory efficiency.

Result: SmallThinker models (4B-A0.6B and 21B-A3B) achieve state-of-the-art performance, exceeding 20 tokens/s on consumer CPUs with minimal memory usage (1GB and 8GB).

Conclusion: SmallThinker demonstrates that LLMs can be efficiently deployed on local devices without expensive GPUs, offering a viable alternative to cloud-based solutions.

Abstract: While frontier large language models (LLMs) continue to push capability
boundaries, their deployment remains confined to GPU-powered cloud
infrastructure. We challenge this paradigm with SmallThinker, a family of LLMs
natively designed - not adapted - for the unique constraints of local devices:
weak computational power, limited memory, and slow storage. Unlike traditional
approaches that mainly compress existing models built for clouds, we architect
SmallThinker from the ground up to thrive within these limitations. Our
innovation lies in a deployment-aware architecture that transforms constraints
into design principles. First, We introduce a two-level sparse structure
combining fine-grained Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with sparse feed-forward
networks, drastically reducing computational demands without sacrificing model
capacity. Second, to conquer the I/O bottleneck of slow storage, we design a
pre-attention router that enables our co-designed inference engine to prefetch
expert parameters from storage while computing attention, effectively hiding
storage latency that would otherwise cripple on-device inference. Third, for
memory efficiency, we utilize NoPE-RoPE hybrid sparse attention mechanism to
slash KV cache requirements. We release SmallThinker-4B-A0.6B and
SmallThinker-21B-A3B, which achieve state-of-the-art performance scores and
even outperform larger LLMs. Remarkably, our co-designed system mostly
eliminates the need for expensive GPU hardware: with Q4_0 quantization, both
models exceed 20 tokens/s on ordinary consumer CPUs, while consuming only 1GB
and 8GB of memory respectively. SmallThinker is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces methods for estimating personalized treatment effects using unstructured data, addressing confounding and sampling biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on structured covariates, limiting their use with unstructured data like clinical notes or medical images.

Method: Proposes a 'plug-in' method for neural representations of unstructured data and two estimators to avoid confounding bias. Also introduces a regression-based correction for sampling bias.

Result: The plug-in method performs well across settings, despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: The methods enable accurate treatment effect estimation from unstructured data while mitigating biases.

Abstract: Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely
on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data.
Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable
application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or
medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate
'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured
data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the
method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two
theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the
confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment
effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When
these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative
subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address
this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the
non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be
well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in
method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong
empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity.

TL;DR: MDM-OC is a framework for scalable, interference-free, and reversible model composition, addressing issues like task interference and catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging and continual learning methods often cause task interference, forgetting, or lack of reversibility, limiting real-world AI deployments.

Method: Encodes task-specific models as deltas from a shared base, projects them into orthogonal subspaces, and merges them via gradient-based optimization. Supports continual integration, unmerging, and stability techniques.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity on vision and NLP benchmarks, while being memory-efficient.

Conclusion: MDM-OC provides a principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

Abstract: In real-world machine learning deployments, models must be continually
updated, composed, and when required, selectively undone. However, existing
approaches to model merging and continual learning often suffer from task
interference, catastrophic forgetting, or lack of reversibility. We propose
Modular Delta Merging with Orthogonal Constraints (MDM-OC), a novel framework
that enables scalable, interference-free, and reversible composition of
fine-tuned models. Each task-specific model is encoded as a delta from a shared
base and projected into an orthogonal subspace to eliminate conflict. These
projected deltas are then merged via gradient-based optimization to form a
unified model that retains performance across tasks. Our approach supports
continual integration of new models, structured unmerging for compliance such
as GDPR requirements, and model stability via elastic weight consolidation and
synthetic replay. Extensive experiments on vision and natural language
processing benchmarks demonstrate that MDM-OC outperforms prior baselines in
accuracy, backward transfer, and unmerge fidelity, while remaining
memory-efficient and computationally tractable. This framework offers a
principled solution for modular and compliant AI system design.

Motivation: Address the black-box nature of DNNs in high-stakes domains requiring transparency.

Method: Introduces Compositional Function Networks (CFNs) with diverse compositional patterns (sequential, parallel, conditional) and differentiable training.

Result: CFNs achieve 96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10, outperforming interpretable models like Explainable Boosting Machines.

Conclusion: CFNs combine deep learning expressiveness with interpretability, ideal for performance-critical and accountable applications.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deliver impressive performance but their
black-box nature limits deployment in high-stakes domains requiring
transparency. We introduce Compositional Function Networks (CFNs), a novel
framework that builds inherently interpretable models by composing elementary
mathematical functions with clear semantics. Unlike existing interpretable
approaches that are limited to simple additive structures, CFNs support diverse
compositional patterns -- sequential, parallel, and conditional -- enabling
complex feature interactions while maintaining transparency. A key innovation
is that CFNs are fully differentiable, allowing efficient training through
standard gradient descent. We demonstrate CFNs' versatility across multiple
domains, from symbolic regression to image classification with deep
hierarchical networks. Our empirical evaluation shows CFNs achieve competitive
performance against black-box models (96.24% accuracy on CIFAR-10) while
outperforming state-of-the-art interpretable models like Explainable Boosting
Machines. By combining the hierarchical expressiveness and efficient training
of deep learning with the intrinsic interpretability of well-defined
mathematical functions, CFNs offer a powerful framework for applications where
both performance and accountability are paramount.

TL;DR: The study benchmarks machine learning and deep learning models for cognitive prediction using fMRI data, finding task-based fMRI superior to resting-state. GNN with SC and FC performed best, while TGNN showed promise for temporal dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand neural mechanisms of cognition and apply findings in precision medicine and early detection of neurological/psychiatric conditions.

Method: Compared Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Transformer-GNN (TGNN) using resting-state and task-based fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project.

Result: Task-based fMRI outperformed resting-state. GNN with SC and FC achieved the highest performance, though not significantly better than KRR with FC alone. TGNN performed well with task-fMRI but struggled with resting-state.

Conclusion: Appropriate model architectures and feature representations are crucial for leveraging neuroimaging data. Multimodal DL models and Transformer-based approaches show promise for cognitive prediction.

Abstract: Predicting cognition from neuroimaging data in healthy individuals offers
insights into the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive abilities, with
potential applications in precision medicine and early detection of
neurological and psychiatric conditions. This study systematically benchmarked
classical machine learning (Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR)) and advanced deep
learning (DL) models (Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformer-GNN (TGNN))
for cognitive prediction using Resting-state (RS), Working Memory, and Language
task fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset.
  Our results, based on R2 scores, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean
absolute error, revealed that task-based fMRI, eliciting neural responses
directly tied to cognition, outperformed RS fMRI in predicting cognitive
behavior. Among the methods compared, a GNN combining structural connectivity
(SC) and functional connectivity (FC) consistently achieved the highest
performance across all fMRI modalities; however, its advantage over KRR using
FC alone was not statistically significant. The TGNN, designed to model
temporal dynamics with SC as a prior, performed competitively with FC-based
approaches for task-fMRI but struggled with RS data, where its performance
aligned with the lower-performing GNN that directly used fMRI time-series data
as node features. These findings emphasize the importance of selecting
appropriate model architectures and feature representations to fully leverage
the spatial and temporal richness of neuroimaging data.
  This study highlights the potential of multimodal graph-aware DL models to
combine SC and FC for cognitive prediction, as well as the promise of
Transformer-based approaches for capturing temporal dynamics. By providing a
comprehensive comparison of models, this work serves as a guide for advancing
brain-behavior modeling using fMRI, SC and DL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance behavior classification accuracy for better health management and farm efficiency in Precision Livestock Farming.

Method: Combines Wavelet Denoising with a Low Pass Filter, tailored to active and inactive pig behaviors.

Abstract: This study proposes a behavior-specific filtering method to improve behavior
classification accuracy in Precision Livestock Farming. While traditional
filtering methods, such as wavelet denoising, achieved an accuracy of 91.58%,
they apply uniform processing to all behaviors. In contrast, the proposed
behavior-specific filtering method combines Wavelet Denoising with a Low Pass
Filter, tailored to active and inactive pig behaviors, and achieved a peak
accuracy of 94.73%. These results highlight the effectiveness of
behavior-specific filtering in enhancing animal behavior monitoring, supporting

### [436] [On Using the Shapley Value for Anomaly Localization: A Statistical Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21023)
*Rick S. Blum,Franziska Freytag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using a fixed term in Shapley value calculation simplifies anomaly localization with the same error probability as full Shapley value, proven for independent cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify anomaly localization in sensor data systems while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Employ a single fixed term in Shapley value calculation instead of the full Shapley value.

Result: Achieves lower complexity with the same error probability for independent cases; dependent cases remain unproven.

Conclusion: Fixed-term Shapley value is effective for independent cases, but further research is needed for dependent cases.

Abstract: Recent publications have suggested using the Shapley value for anomaly
localization for sensor data systems. Using a reasonable mathematical anomaly
model for full control, experiments indicate that using a single fixed term in
the Shapley value calculation achieves a lower complexity anomaly localization
test, with the same probability of error, as a test using the Shapley value for
all cases tested. A proof demonstrates these conclusions must be true for all
independent observation cases. For dependent observation cases, no proof is
available.

*Mayumi Nakano,Yuya Seki,Shuta Kikuchi,Shu Tanaka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a sequential dataset construction method for FMA to improve optimization performance by focusing on recent data points, outperforming conventional FMA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stagnation in FMA performance due to diluted impact of new data points as dataset grows.

Method: Introduces a sequential dataset construction method retaining only recent data points to enhance surrogate model accuracy.

Result: Proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions with fewer evaluations than conventional FMA.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses stagnation by prioritizing recent data, improving optimization efficiency.

Abstract: Black-box (BB) optimization problems aim to identify an input that minimizes
the output of a function (the BB function) whose input-output relationship is
unknown. Factorization machine with annealing (FMA) is a promising approach to
this task, employing a factorization machine (FM) as a surrogate model to
iteratively guide the solution search via an Ising machine. Although FMA has
demonstrated strong optimization performance across various applications, its
performance often stagnates as the number of optimization iterations increases.
One contributing factor to this stagnation is the growing number of data points
in the dataset used to train FM. It is hypothesized that as more data points
are accumulated, the contribution of newly added data points becomes diluted
within the entire dataset, thereby reducing their impact on improving the
prediction accuracy of FM. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for
sequential dataset construction that retains at most a specified number of the
most recently added data points. This strategy is designed to enhance the
influence of newly added data points on the surrogate model. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed FMA achieves lower-cost solutions
with fewer BB function evaluations compared to the conventional FMA.

*Jinzhou Wu,Baoping Tang,Qikang Li,Yi Wang,Cheng Li,Shujian Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel MSDA framework using a pretrained Brain Foundation Model (BFM) for dynamic source selection and CS/CCS divergences for feature and decision-level alignment improves MI-EEG decoding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in MI-EEG decoding, such as inter-subject variability and limited labeled data, which cause negative transfer and high computational costs in existing MSDA methods.

Method: Proposes a BFM-guided dynamic source selection and employs CS/CCS divergences for joint feature and decision-level alignment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets, with BFM selection reducing training time without performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances domain invariance and discriminability, offering a scalable solution for MI-EEG decoding.

Abstract: Decoding motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, a key
non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm for controlling external
systems, has been significantly advanced by deep learning. However, MI-EEG
decoding remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject variability and
limited labeled target data, which necessitate costly calibration for new
users. Many existing multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods
indiscriminately incorporate all available source domains, disregarding the
large inter-subject differences in EEG signals, which leads to negative
transfer and excessive computational costs. Moreover, while many approaches
focus on feature distribution alignment, they often neglect the explicit
dependence between features and decision-level outputs, limiting their ability
to preserve discriminative structures. To address these gaps, we propose a
novel MSDA framework that leverages a pretrained large Brain Foundation Model
(BFM) for dynamic and informed source subject selection, ensuring only relevant
sources contribute to adaptation. Furthermore, we employ Cauchy-Schwarz (CS)
and Conditional CS (CCS) divergences to jointly perform feature-level and
decision-level alignment, enhancing domain invariance while maintaining class
discriminability. Extensive evaluations on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms a broad range of state-of-the-art
baselines. Additional experiments with a large source pool validate the
scalability and efficiency of BFM-guided selection, which significantly reduces
training time without sacrificing performance.

*Aditya Ravuri,Neil D. Lawrence*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper interprets transformers probabilistically using Laplacian Eigenmaps, showing they perform linear dimensionality reduction initially and derive a graph Laplacian term. Subtracting the identity from the attention matrix improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a probabilistic interpretation of transformers and enhance their performance by modifying the attention mechanism.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model, analyzes transformer initialization, and modifies the attention matrix by subtracting the identity.

Result: Demonstrates improved validation performance on a language model and a simple vision transformer.

Conclusion: The probabilistic framework and attention matrix modification enhance transformer performance.

Abstract: We propose a probabilistic interpretation of transformers as unrolled
inference steps assuming a probabilistic Laplacian Eigenmaps model from the
ProbDR framework. Our derivation shows that at initialisation, transformers
perform "linear" dimensionality reduction. We also show that within the
transformer block, a graph Laplacian term arises from our arguments, rather
than an attention matrix (which we interpret as an adjacency matrix). We
demonstrate that simply subtracting the identity from the attention matrix (and
thereby taking a graph diffusion step) improves validation performance on a
language model and a simple vision transformer.

### [440] [Rep-MTL: Unleashing the Power of Representation-level Task Saliency for Multi-Task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21049)
*Zedong Wang,Siyuan Li,Dan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rep-MTL introduces a representation-level approach to multi-task learning, focusing on task saliency and inter-task complementarity, outperforming traditional conflict-solving methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-task optimization techniques focus on conflict resolution but neglect the potential of shared representation spaces for inter-task complementarity.

Method: Rep-MTL uses representation-level task saliency, entropy-based penalization, and sample-wise cross-task alignment to balance task-specific learning and shared representation.

Result: Rep-MTL achieves competitive performance on four MTL benchmarks, balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing effectively.

Conclusion: Rep-MTL demonstrates the value of leveraging shared representation spaces for complementary information sharing in multi-task learning.

Abstract: Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary
knowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques
remain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and
gradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this
paper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions
naturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations
complementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the
inter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition
leads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to
quantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared
representation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based
penalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate
negative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks
instead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary
information sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL
benchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results
show that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves
competitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard
performance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's
efficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing. The

### [441] [Flow Matching Policy Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21053)
*David McAllister,Songwei Ge,Brent Yi,Chung Min Kim,Ethan Weber,Hongsuk Choi,Haiwen Feng,Angjoo Kanazawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FPO integrates flow matching into policy gradient reinforcement learning, avoiding exact likelihood computation and outperforming Gaussian policies in multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage flow-based generative models for reinforcement learning without being tied to specific sampling methods, enabling better handling of multimodal action distributions.

Method: FPO combines flow matching with policy gradients, using an advantage-weighted ratio from conditional flow matching loss, compatible with PPO-clip.

Result: FPO successfully trains diffusion-style policies in continuous control tasks, outperforming Gaussian policies in under-conditioned settings.

Conclusion: FPO provides a flexible and effective approach for integrating flow-based models into reinforcement learning, enhancing performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models, including diffusion models, excel at modeling
continuous distributions in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we introduce
Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning
algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO
casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed
from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the
popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood
computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models.
Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind
training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of
diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that
FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous
control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action
distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies,
particularly in under-conditioned settings.

*Armen Manukyan,Hrant Khachatrian,Edvard Ghukasyan,Theofanis P. Raptis*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The study evaluates Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links in Rome, finding antenna properties critical for simulation fidelity, while solver hyper-parameters have minimal impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the realism of Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing in outdoor cellular scenarios using real-world measurements.

Method: Systematic variation of simulation parameters (e.g., path depth, antenna properties) and evaluation via Spearman correlation and kNN-based localization.

Result: Antenna locations and orientations significantly impact fidelity, improving correlation by 5-130% and reducing localization error by one-third.

Conclusion: Precise geometry and antenna models are essential, but capturing urban noise remains a challenge for high-fidelity RF simulation.

Abstract: We study the realism of Sionna v1.0.2 ray-tracing for outdoor cellular links
in central Rome. We use a real measurement set of 1,664 user-equipments (UEs)
and six nominal base-station (BS) sites. Using these fixed positions we
systematically vary the main simulation parameters, including path depth,
diffuse/specular/refraction flags, carrier frequency, as well as antenna's
properties like its altitude, radiation pattern, and orientation. Simulator
fidelity is scored for each base station via Spearman correlation between
measured and simulated powers, and by a fingerprint-based k-nearest-neighbor
localization algorithm using RSSI-based fingerprints. Across all experiments,
solver hyper-parameters are having immaterial effect on the chosen metrics. On
the contrary, antenna locations and orientations prove decisive. By simple
greedy optimization we improve the Spearman correlation by 5% to 130% for
various base stations, while kNN-based localization error using only simulated
data as reference points is decreased by one-third on real-world samples, while
staying twice higher than the error with purely real data. Precise geometry and
credible antenna models are therefore necessary but not sufficient; faithfully
capturing the residual urban noise remains an open challenge for transferable,
high-fidelity outdoor RF simulation.

*Beining Wu,Jun Huang,Shui Yu*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper surveys the shift from throughput-based to information-aware networking, introducing a four-dimensional framework for information metrics and highlighting AI's role in optimizing information quality across six application domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern applications like autonomous vehicles and metaverse environments require nuanced information quality metrics beyond traditional network performance indicators like latency and packet loss.

Method: The study presents a four-dimensional taxonomic framework (temporal, quality/utility, reliability/robustness, network/communication) and analyzes interdependencies among these dimensions. AI technologies (e.g., deep reinforcement learning) are leveraged for adaptive optimization.

Result: The framework reveals interdependencies among dimensions (e.g., temporal freshness triggers quality evaluation) and demonstrates AI's effectiveness in optimizing information quality across six application domains.

Conclusion: Multi-dimensional information metrics hold revolutionary promise for diverse applications, though implementation challenges remain.

Abstract: The development of next-generation networking systems has inherently shifted
from throughput-based paradigms towards intelligent, information-aware designs
that emphasize the quality, relevance, and utility of transmitted information,
rather than sheer data volume. While classical network metrics, such as latency
and packet loss, remain significant, they are insufficient to quantify the
nuanced information quality requirements of modern intelligent applications,
including autonomous vehicles, digital twins, and metaverse environments. In
this survey, we present the first comprehensive study of the ``X of
Information'' continuum by introducing a systematic four-dimensional taxonomic
framework that structures information metrics along temporal, quality/utility,
reliability/robustness, and network/communication dimensions. We uncover the
increasing interdependencies among these dimensions, whereby temporal freshness
triggers quality evaluation, which in turn helps with reliability appraisal,
ultimately enabling effective network delivery. Our analysis reveals that
artificial intelligence technologies, such as deep reinforcement learning,
multi-agent systems, and neural optimization models, enable adaptive,
context-aware optimization of competing information quality objectives. In our
extensive study of six critical application domains, covering autonomous
transportation, industrial IoT, healthcare digital twins, UAV communications,
LLM ecosystems, and metaverse settings, we illustrate the revolutionary promise
of multi-dimensional information metrics for meeting diverse operational needs.
Our survey identifies prominent implementation challenges, including ...

*Gongli Xi,Ye Tian,Yannan Hu,Yuchao Zhang,Yapeng Niu,Xiangyang Gong*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: Proposes DSTF-Diffusion, a model for generating synthetic DDoS attack traces with improved realism and accuracy for ML-based detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of realistic synthetic DDoS attack datasets for training ML models, which limits detection accuracy.

Method: Uses a dual-stream approach (field and spatial streams) in a diffusion model to capture spatial and temporal patterns of DDoS attacks.

Result: Generates synthetic traces with higher statistical similarity to real data, improving downstream ML task performance.

Conclusion: DSTF-Diffusion effectively enhances the quality of synthetic DDoS datasets, aiding ML-based detection systems.

Abstract: In response to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, recent research
efforts increasingly rely on Machine Learning (ML)-based solutions, whose
effectiveness largely depends on the quality of labeled training datasets. To
address the scarcity of such datasets, data augmentation with synthetic traces
is often employed. However, current synthetic trace generation methods struggle
to capture the complex temporal patterns and spatial distributions exhibited in
emerging DDoS attacks. This results in insufficient resemblance to real traces
and unsatisfied detection accuracy when applied to ML tasks. In this paper, we
propose Dual-Stream Temporal-Field Diffusion (DSTF-Diffusion), a multi-view,
multi-stream network traffic generative model based on diffusion models,
featuring two main streams: The field stream utilizes spatial mapping to bridge
network data characteristics with pre-trained realms of stable diffusion
models, effectively translating complex network interactions into formats that
stable diffusion can process, while the spatial stream adopts a dynamic
temporal modeling approach, meticulously capturing the intrinsic temporal
patterns of network traffic. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data
generated by our model exhibits higher statistical similarity to originals
compared to current state-of-the-art solutions, and enhance performances on a
wide range of downstream tasks.

### [445] [\textit{FedABC}: Attention-Based Client Selection for Federated Learning with Long-Term View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20871)
*Wenxuan Ye,Xueli An,Junfan Wang,Xueqiang Yan,Georg Carle*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: FedABC is a client selection algorithm for Federated Learning (FL) that improves model accuracy and efficiency by addressing data heterogeneity and optimizing client participation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to tackle challenges in FL, such as slow convergence due to client data heterogeneity and the burden of frequent client participation, to enhance FL's effectiveness in 6G networks.

Method: The proposed FedABC algorithm uses attention mechanisms to prioritize informative clients, evaluates model similarity and contributions, and adaptively adjusts selection thresholds based on the "later-is-better" principle.

Result: FedABC achieves 3.5% higher accuracy with 2% fewer clients than state-of-the-art methods and matches performance with 32% fewer clients than FedAvg, as demonstrated on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: FedABC advances FL deployment in heterogeneous, resource-limited settings, supporting native AI in 6G networks.

Abstract: Native AI support is a key objective in the evolution of 6G networks, with
Federated Learning (FL) emerging as a promising paradigm. FL allows
decentralized clients to collaboratively train an AI model without directly
sharing their data, preserving privacy. Clients train local models on private
data and share model updates, which a central server aggregates to refine the
global model and redistribute it for the next iteration. However, client data
heterogeneity slows convergence and reduces model accuracy, and frequent client
participation imposes communication and computational burdens. To address these
challenges, we propose \textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection
algorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and
optimizing client participation. Inspired by attention mechanisms,
\textit{FedABC} prioritizes informative clients by evaluating both model
similarity and each model's unique contributions to the global model. Moreover,
considering the evolving demands of the global model, we formulate an
optimization problem to guide \textit{FedABC} throughout the training process.
Following the ``later-is-better" principle, \textit{FedABC} adaptively adjusts
the client selection threshold, encouraging greater participation in later
training stages. Extensive simulations on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that
\textit{FedABC} significantly outperforms existing approaches in model accuracy
and client participation efficiency, achieving comparable performance with 32\%
fewer clients than the classical FL algorithm \textit{FedAvg}, and 3.5\% higher
accuracy with 2\% fewer clients than the state-of-the-art. This work marks a
step toward deploying FL in heterogeneous, resource-constrained environments,
thereby supporting native AI capabilities in 6G networks.

*Paul Schwerdtner,Prakash Mohan,Julie Bessac,Marc T. Henry de Frahan,Benjamin Peherstorfer*

Main category: math.DS

TL;DR: A greedy training procedure for quadratic manifolds improves reduced model accuracy by considering both reconstruction and prediction errors, outperforming traditional methods by up to two orders of magnitude.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional quadratic manifold training minimizes reconstruction error but ignores downstream model accuracy, leading to poor performance in reduced models.

Method: Proposes a greedy training procedure that balances reconstruction error and prediction error of reduced models fitted to the data.

Result: Numerical experiments show the proposed method achieves up to two orders of magnitude higher accuracy in reduced models.

Conclusion: The greedy approach avoids non-smooth embeddings and significantly improves reduced model accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Quadratic manifolds for nonintrusive reduced modeling are typically trained
to minimize the reconstruction error on snapshot data, which means that the
error of models fitted to the embedded data in downstream learning steps is
ignored. In contrast, we propose a greedy training procedure that takes into
account both the reconstruction error on the snapshot data and the prediction
error of reduced models fitted to the data. Because our procedure learns
quadratic manifolds with the objective of achieving accurate reduced models, it
avoids oscillatory and other non-smooth embeddings that can hinder learning
accurate reduced models. Numerical experiments on transport and turbulent flow
problems show that quadratic manifolds trained with the proposed greedy
approach lead to reduced models with up to two orders of magnitude higher
accuracy than quadratic manifolds trained with respect to the reconstruction
error alone.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, contrasting it with heuristic methods by leveraging information theory and statistical physics for better performance guarantees and model plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current symbolic regression methods rely on heuristics, lacking theoretical grounding and performance guarantees. The probabilistic approach addresses this gap.

Method: The probabilistic approach uses information theory and statistical physics to evaluate model plausibility and performance, avoiding heuristic criteria.

Result: The approach provides theoretical guarantees and compels the use of model ensembles over single models.

Conclusion: The probabilistic method offers a more principled alternative to heuristic symbolic regression, with advantages in plausibility and performance.

Abstract: Symbolic regression automates the process of learning closed-form
mathematical models from data. Standard approaches to symbolic regression, as
well as newer deep learning approaches, rely on heuristic model selection
criteria, heuristic regularization, and heuristic exploration of model space.
Here, we discuss the probabilistic approach to symbolic regression, an
alternative to such heuristic approaches with direct connections to information
theory and statistical physics. We show how the probabilistic approach
establishes model plausibility from basic considerations and explicit
approximations, and how it provides guarantees of performance that heuristic
approaches lack. We also discuss how the probabilistic approach compels us to
consider model ensembles, as opposed to single models.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for solder joint reliability, outperforming regular BO by 3% and saving half the computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational expense of simulating solder joint reliability under thermomechanical loading, the paper aims to improve efficiency using data-driven methods.

Method: The authors introduce a heuristic framework for adaptive BO with Gaussian process regression, leveraging surrogate modeling and multiple acquisition functions.

Result: Adaptive BO outperforms regular BO by 3% on average and reduces computational costs by half in synthetic and engineering use cases.

Conclusion: The adaptive BO framework demonstrates superior efficiency and cost savings, with open-source implementations provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Solder joint reliability related to failures due to thermomechanical loading
is a critically important yet physically complex engineering problem. As a
result, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an
increasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design
schemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with
Gaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The
authors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting
thorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple
acquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational
cost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the
shortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel
heuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the
various optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to
regular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The
results show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing
regular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint
reliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep
strain under a cyclic thermal load. Results show that adaptive BO outperforms
regular BO by 3% on average at any given computational budget threshold,
critically saving half of the computational expense budget. This practical
result underlines the methodological potential of the adaptive Bayesian
data-driven methodology to achieve better results and cut optimization-related
expenses. Lastly, in order to promote the reproducibility of the results, the
data-driven implementations are made available on an open-source basis.

*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Md Monzur Murshed,Sameera Hewage,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test, a non-parametric probe for assessing classifier confidence calibration by testing internal logit consistency. It reveals ViTs achieve near-perfect calibration, while CNNs like ResNet show deep inconsistencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often produce poorly calibrated confidence scores, limiting reliability in high-stakes applications. Existing methods don't examine internal prediction consistency.

Method: The BoC test reframes confidence estimation as a frequentist hypothesis test, evaluating if a model's top-ranked class wins 1-v-1 contests against random competitors at a rate matching its softmax probability.

Result: ViTs achieve near-perfect calibration (ECE 0.0212, 88% improvement), while CNNs exhibit inconsistencies between predictions and logit structure.

Conclusion: BoC is a diagnostic tool for understanding uncertainty representation in architectures, not just a calibration method.

Abstract: Modern neural networks, despite their high accuracy, often produce poorly
calibrated confidence scores, limiting their reliability in high-stakes
applications. Existing calibration methods typically post-process model outputs
without interrogating the internal consistency of the predictions themselves.
In this work, we introduce a novel, non-parametric statistical probe, the
Bag-of-Coins (BoC) test, that examines the internal consistency of a
classifier's logits. The BoC test reframes confidence estimation as a
frequentist hypothesis test: does the model's top-ranked class win 1-v-1
contests against random competitors at a rate consistent with its own stated
softmax probability? When applied to modern deep learning architectures, this
simple probe reveals a fundamental dichotomy. On Vision Transformers (ViTs),
the BoC output serves as a state-of-the-art confidence score, achieving
near-perfect calibration with an ECE of 0.0212, an 88% improvement over a
temperature-scaled baseline. Conversely, on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) like ResNet, the probe reveals a deep inconsistency between the model's
predictions and its internal logit structure, a property missed by traditional
metrics. We posit that BoC is not merely a calibration method, but a new
diagnostic tool for understanding and exposing the differing ways that popular
architectures represent uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature extraction in spatiotemporal data by leveraging sparsity for localized structures, while maintaining noise robustness.

Method: Sparse-mode DMD applies sparsity-promoting regularization within the optimized DMD framework to identify and separate local and global modes.

Result: The method successfully distinguishes between discrete and continuous spectra in synthetic and real-world systems, including optical waveguides and sea surface temperature data.

Conclusion: Sparse-mode DMD effectively extracts localized features and disambiguates modes, offering unsupervised spectral decomposition in diverse applications.

Abstract: The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a data-driven approach that extracts
the dominant features from spatiotemporal data. In this work, we introduce
sparse-mode DMD, a new variant of the optimized DMD framework that specifically
leverages sparsity-promoting regularization in order to approximate DMD modes
which have localized spatial structure. The algorithm maintains the
noise-robust properties of optimized DMD while disambiguating between modes
which are spatially local versus global in nature. In many applications, such
modes are associated with discrete and continuous spectra respectively, thus
allowing the algorithm to explicitly construct, in an unsupervised manner, the
distinct portions of the spectrum. We demonstrate this by analyzing synthetic
and real-world systems, including examples from optical waveguides, quantum
mechanics, and sea surface temperature data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting PD progression non-invasively is vital, and voice biomarkers provide a telemonitoring solution, but analyzing longitudinal data is complex due to patient-specific patterns.

scores) through telemonitoring. Analyzing this longitudinal data is challenging
due to within-subject correlations and complex, nonlinear patient-specific
progression patterns. This study benchmarks LMMs against two advanced hybrid
approaches: the Generalized Neural Network Mixed Model (GNMM) (Mandel 2021),
which embeds a neural network within a GLMM structure, and the Neural Mixed
Effects (NME) model (Wortwein 2023), allowing nonlinear subject-specific
parameters throughout the network. Using the Oxford Parkinson's telemonitoring
voice dataset, we evaluate these models' performance in predicting Total UPDRS
to offer practical guidance for PD research and clinical applications.

### [452] [Statistical Inference for Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20560)
*Xintao Xia,Linjun Zhang,Zhanrui Cai*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper bridges the gap in statistical inference for DP-SGD by analyzing its asymptotic properties and proposing two methods for valid confidence intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on cyclic subsampling, but DP-SGD requires randomized subsampling, creating a need for adapted inference techniques.

Method: Establishes asymptotic properties of SGD under randomized subsampling, extends to DP-SGD, and proposes plug-in and random scaling methods for confidence intervals.

Result: Asymptotic variance of DP-SGD decomposes into statistical, sampling, and privacy components; proposed methods achieve nominal coverage rates.

Conclusion: The study successfully adapts inference methods for DP-SGD, ensuring valid confidence intervals while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Privacy preservation in machine learning, particularly through Differentially
Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), is critical for sensitive data
analysis. However, existing statistical inference methods for SGD predominantly
focus on cyclic subsampling, while DP-SGD requires randomized subsampling. This
paper first bridges this gap by establishing the asymptotic properties of SGD
under the randomized rule and extending these results to DP-SGD. For the output
of DP-SGD, we show that the asymptotic variance decomposes into statistical,
sampling, and privacy-induced components. Two methods are proposed for
constructing valid confidence intervals: the plug-in method and the random
scaling method. We also perform extensive numerical analysis, which shows that
the proposed confidence intervals achieve nominal coverage rates while
maintaining privacy.

### [453] [Multivariate Conformal Prediction via Conformalized Gaussian Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20941)
*Sacha Braun,Eugène Berta,Michael I. Jordan,Francis Bach*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gaussian-based conformal prediction method to approximate conditional coverage, avoiding costly sampling by using Mahalanobis distance, and extends it for missing values, partial information, and output transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is impractical without strong assumptions, so the goal is to find realizable approximations, especially for heteroskedasticity.

Method: Replace CDF-based nonconformity scores with a Gaussian-based Mahalanobis distance, enabling closed-form conformalization and extensions like handling missing values and partial information.

Result: Empirical results show the method better approximates conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to alternatives.

Conclusion: The Gaussian-based approach is computationally efficient and versatile, improving conditional coverage approximation in conformal prediction.

Abstract: While achieving exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is
unattainable without making strong, untestable regularity assumptions, the
promise of conformal prediction hinges on finding approximations to conditional
guarantees that are realizable in practice. A promising direction for obtaining
conditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing
heteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density
$\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this
vein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative
distribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly,
typically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling,
we observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the
case of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly
conformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a
number of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how
to construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets
as partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal
sets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results
indicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely
approximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to
alternative methods.

*Trevor Harris,Yan Liu*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: LSCI introduces a framework for uncertainty quantification in neural operator models, improving adaptivity and coverage with statistical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operator models lack inherent predictive uncertainty, limiting their reliability in large-scale dynamical systems.

Method: LSCI uses projection-based depth scoring and localized conformal inference for function-valued prediction sets.

Result: The method achieves approximate finite-sample marginal coverage and shows gains in adaptivity and coverage in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: LSCI provides a robust, locally adaptive solution for uncertainty quantification in neural operator models.

Abstract: Operator models are regression algorithms for functional data and have become
a key tool for emulating large-scale dynamical systems. Recent advances in deep
neural operators have dramatically improved the accuracy and scalability of
operator modeling, but lack an inherent notion of predictive uncertainty. We
introduce Local Spectral Conformal Inference (LSCI), a new framework for
locally adaptive, distribution-free uncertainty quantification for neural
operator models. LSCI uses projection-based depth scoring and localized
conformal inference to generate function-valued prediction sets with
statistical guarantees. We prove approximate finite-sample marginal coverage
under local exchangeability, and demonstrate significant gains in adaptivity
and coverage across synthetic and real-world operator learning tasks.

### [455] [Does AI and Human Advice Mitigate Punishment for Selfish Behavior? An Experiment on AI ethics From a Psychological Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19487)
*Margarita Leib,Nils Köbis,Ivan Soraperra*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores how people punish selfish behavior influenced by AI, human, or no advice, finding that advice content and behavior shape punishment, but the advice source does not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-driven selfish behavior is perceived and punished compared to human advice or no advice.

Method: A pre-registered, financially-incentivized experiment where evaluators punished decision-makers based on their behavior (selfish/prosocial) and the advice they received (AI/human/none, selfish/prosocial).

Result: Selfish behavior was punished more harshly after prosocial advice and leniently after selfish advice. AI advice led to higher responsibility attribution but similar punishment as human advice.

Conclusion: Behavior and advice content influence punishment, while the advice source (AI or human) does not.

Abstract: People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such
advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by
selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study
this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine
machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered,
financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real
decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii)
encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved
selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further
assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed
that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior
was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to
receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after
prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas
selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI
compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not
vary. Overall, behavior and advice content shape punishment, whereas the advice
source does not.

### [456] [Justifications for Democratizing AI Alignment and Their Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19548)
*André Steingrüber,Kevin Baum*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores democratic vs. epistocratic approaches to AI alignment, highlighting justifications and challenges, and suggests hybrid frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the normative problem in AI alignment by comparing democratic and epistocratic approaches and their justifications.

Method: Analyzes instrumental and non-instrumental justifications for democratic approaches and identifies challenges.

Result: Finds gaps in purely epistocratic or democratic methods, advocating for hybrid frameworks.

Conclusion: Hybrid approaches combining expert judgment and participatory input, with safeguards, are recommended.

Abstract: The AI alignment problem comprises both technical and normative dimensions.
While technical solutions focus on implementing normative constraints in AI
systems, the normative problem concerns determining what these constraints
should be. This paper examines justifications for democratic approaches to the
normative problem -- where affected stakeholders determine AI alignment -- as
opposed to epistocratic approaches that defer to normative experts. We analyze
both instrumental justifications (democratic approaches produce better
outcomes) and non-instrumental justifications (democratic approaches prevent
illegitimate authority or coercion). We argue that normative and metanormative
uncertainty create a justificatory gap that democratic approaches aim to fill
through political rather than theoretical justification. However, we identify
significant challenges for democratic approaches, particularly regarding the
prevention of illegitimate coercion through AI alignment. Our analysis suggests
that neither purely epistocratic nor purely democratic approaches may be
sufficient on their own, pointing toward hybrid frameworks that combine expert
judgment with participatory input alongside institutional safeguards against AI
monopolization.

*Ran Tong,Songtao Wei,Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a robustness benchmark for detecting hateful memes targeting LGBTQ+ communities, testing combinations of caption attacks and image corruptions on PrideMM. MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2 are evaluated, with the latter improved by a Text Denoising Adapter (TDA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hateful memes often evade detection by altering captions or images, highlighting the need for robust multimodal safety models.

Method: A benchmark pairs four caption attacks with three image corruptions on PrideMM, testing MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, enhanced by TDA.

Result: MemeCLIP degrades gently, while MemeBLIP2 is sensitive to caption edits but becomes most robust with TDA. Systems rely heavily on text, with architecture and pre-training impacting robustness.

Conclusion: The benchmark identifies weaknesses in current models and shows lightweight modules like TDA can strengthen defenses.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking
either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark
for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical
image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two
state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and
we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the
latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while
MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its
language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this
weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal
that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and
pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where
current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted,
lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger
defences.

### [458] [PEMUTA: Pedagogically-Enriched Multi-Granular Undergraduate Thesis Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19556)
*Jialu Zhang,Qingyang Sun,Qianyi Wang,Weiyi Zhang,Zunjie Xiao,Xiaoqing Zhang,Jianfeng Ren,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: PEMUTA is a pedagogically-enriched framework using LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment, aligning with expert evaluations through hierarchical prompting and in-context learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack nuanced, multi-dimensional UGTE evaluation, while pedagogical theories remain underutilized in automation. PEMUTA bridges this gap.

Method: PEMUTA uses hierarchical prompting (guided by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy) and in-context learning (few-shot and role-play prompting) for fine-grained assessment across six dimensions (SLOWPR).

Result: PEMUTA aligns well with expert evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE assessment.

Conclusion: PEMUTA advances automated UGTE evaluation by integrating pedagogical theories and LLMs, enabling nuanced, multi-dimensional assessment.

Abstract: The undergraduate thesis (UGTE) plays an indispensable role in assessing a
student's cumulative academic development throughout their college years.
Although large language models (LLMs) have advanced education intelligence,
they typically focus on holistic assessment with only one single evaluation
score, but ignore the intricate nuances across multifaceted criteria, limiting
their ability to reflect structural criteria, pedagogical objectives, and
diverse academic competencies. Meanwhile, pedagogical theories have long
informed manual UGTE evaluation through multi-dimensional assessment of
cognitive development, disciplinary thinking, and academic performance, yet
remain underutilized in automated settings. Motivated by the research gap, we
pioneer PEMUTA, a pedagogically-enriched framework that effectively activates
domain-specific knowledge from LLMs for multi-granular UGTE assessment. Guided
by Vygotsky's theory and Bloom's Taxonomy, PEMUTA incorporates a hierarchical
prompting scheme that evaluates UGTEs across six fine-grained dimensions:
Structure, Logic, Originality, Writing, Proficiency, and Rigor (SLOWPR),
followed by holistic synthesis. Two in-context learning techniques, \ie,
few-shot prompting and role-play prompting, are also incorporated to further
enhance alignment with expert judgments without fine-tuning. We curate a
dataset of authentic UGTEs with expert-provided SLOWPR-aligned annotations to
support multi-granular UGTE assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
PEMUTA achieves strong alignment with expert evaluations, and exhibits strong
potential for fine-grained, pedagogically-informed UGTE evaluations.

*Gwendal Jouneaux,Jordi Cabot*

TL;DR: The paper addresses the rising energy costs of ML models by proposing a Sustainable Quality Model, integrating Green AI with quality metrics and formalizing sustainability aspects using a Domain-Specific Language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing energy consumption of ML models and the lack of integration between Green AI initiatives and existing quality metrics in ICT motivate the need for a formalized sustainability framework.

Method: The authors propose a Domain-Specific Language to define ML model sustainability aspects, merging Green AI with quality models and extending the Model Cards initiative.

Result: The method enables precise reporting of energy costs and sustainability metrics, facilitating automatic model comparison and certification.

Conclusion: The paper lays the groundwork for a Sustainable Quality Model, enhancing transparency and sustainability in ML practices.

Abstract: The growth of machine learning (ML) models and associated datasets triggers a
consequent dramatic increase in energy costs for the use and training of these
models. In the current context of environmental awareness and global
sustainability concerns involving ICT, Green AI is becoming an important
research topic. Initiatives like the AI Energy Score Ratings are a good
example. Nevertheless, these benchmarking attempts are still to be integrated
with existing work on Quality Models and Service-Level Agreements common in
other, more mature, ICT subfields. This limits the (automatic) analysis of this
model energy descriptions and their use in (semi)automatic model comparison,
selection, and certification processes. We aim to leverage the concept of
quality models and merge it with existing ML model reporting initiatives and
Green/Frugal AI proposals to formalize a Sustainable Quality Model for AI/ML
models. As a first step, we propose a new Domain-Specific Language to precisely
define the sustainability aspects of an ML model (including the energy costs
for its different tasks). This information can then be exported as an extended
version of the well-known Model Cards initiative while, at the same time, being
formal enough to be input of any other model description automatic process.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the potential and risks of using AI, especially LLMs, in healthcare, emphasizing careful application to balance benefits and dangers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI and LLMs can innovate healthcare by improving efficiency and accuracy while addressing risks like misinformation and data privacy.

Method: Analysis of AI and LLM applications in clinical training, practice, and research, highlighting their limitations and risks.

Result: AI and LLMs offer significant benefits in healthcare but require cautious deployment to mitigate risks like misinformation and privacy breaches.

Conclusion: Thoughtful application of AI and LLMs in healthcare is essential to harness their advantages while minimizing potential harms.

Abstract: The medical ecosystem consists of the training of new clinicians and
researchers, the practice of clinical medicine, and areas of adjacent research.
There are many aspects of these domains that could benefit from the application
of task automation and programmatic assistance. Machine learning and artificial
intelligence techniques, including large language models (LLMs), have been
promised to deliver on healthcare innovation, improving care speed and
accuracy, and reducing the burden on staff for manual interventions. However,
LLMs have no understanding of objective truth that is based in reality. They
also represent real risks to the disclosure of protected information when used
by clinicians and researchers. The use of AI in medicine in general, and the
deployment of LLMs in particular, therefore requires careful consideration and
thoughtful application to reap the benefits of these technologies while
avoiding the dangers in each context.

*You Wu,Philip E. Bourne,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI-driven programmable virtual humans aim to bridge the gap between early drug discovery and late development by simulating drug effects in silico, addressing high failure rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI and digital twin approaches in drug discovery are limited to augmenting existing experiments or late-phase development, failing to predict human drug effects early.

Method: Leveraging AI, high-throughput assays, and omics data to create dynamic, multiscale virtual human models for in silico drug testing.

Result: Programmable virtual humans can simulate drug actions from molecular to phenotypic levels, optimizing efficacy and safety earlier.

Conclusion: This approach offers a transformative paradigm for drug discovery, though challenges remain in implementation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked immense interest in drug discovery,
but most current approaches only digitize existing high-throughput experiments.
They remain constrained by conventional pipelines. As a result, they do not
address the fundamental challenges of predicting drug effects in humans.
Similarly, biomedical digital twins, largely grounded in real-world data and
mechanistic models, are tailored for late-phase drug development and lack the
resolution to model molecular interactions or their systemic consequences,
limiting their impact in early-stage discovery. This disconnect between early
discovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates
in drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current
experiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real
world: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent
advances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and
spatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable
virtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from
molecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable
virtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and
safety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of
programmable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug
discovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities,
challenges, and roadmaps for their realization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLM therapists lack realism by disclosing client internal states, limiting assessment of their ability to uncover hidden perspectives.

Method: Introduces MindVoyager, a controllable client simulator that adapts dynamically during counseling sessions, and new metrics to evaluate therapists' exploration of client beliefs.

Result: Provides a more realistic and challenging environment to assess LLM therapists' understanding of clients' unexpressed thoughts.

Conclusion: MindVoyager improves evaluation of LLM therapists by simulating realistic clients and measuring their ability to explore hidden beliefs.

Abstract: Understanding clients' thoughts and beliefs is fundamental in counseling, yet
current evaluations of LLM therapists often fail to assess this ability.
Existing evaluation methods rely on client simulators that clearly disclose
internal states to the therapist, making it difficult to determine whether an
LLM therapist can uncover unexpressed perspectives. To address this limitation,
we introduce MindVoyager, a novel evaluation framework featuring a controllable
and realistic client simulator which dynamically adapts itself based on the
ongoing counseling session, offering a more realistic and challenging
evaluation environment. We further introduce evaluation metrics that assess the
exploration ability of LLM therapists by measuring their thorough understanding
of client's beliefs and thoughts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked environmental costs of LLMs and advocate for sustainable NLP practices.

Method: Case studies of models like GPT-4 and Mistral 7B, quantifying their environmental impact, and analyzing systemic challenges and solutions.

Result: LLMs have significant environmental costs, including high carbon emissions and water usage, with systemic issues like greenwashing and regulatory gaps.

Conclusion: Urgent action is needed to align AI development with planetary boundaries, advocating for ethical accountability and sustainable practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and BERT have revolutionized natural
language processing (NLP), yet their environmental costs remain dangerously
overlooked. This article critiques the sustainability of LLMs, quantifying
their carbon footprint, water usage, and contribution to e-waste through case
studies of models such as GPT-4 and energy-efficient alternatives like Mistral
7B. Training a single LLM can emit carbon dioxide equivalent to hundreds of
cars driven annually, while data centre cooling exacerbates water scarcity in
vulnerable regions. Systemic challenges corporate greenwashing, redundant model
development, and regulatory voids perpetuate harm, disproportionately burdening
marginalized communities in the Global South. However, pathways exist for
sustainable NLP: technical innovations (e.g., model pruning, quantum
computing), policy reforms (carbon taxes, mandatory emissions reporting), and
cultural shifts prioritizing necessity over novelty. By analysing industry
leaders (Google, Microsoft) and laggards (Amazon), this work underscores the
urgency of ethical accountability and global cooperation. Without immediate
action, AIs ecological toll risks outpacing its societal benefits. The article
concludes with a call to align technological progress with planetary
boundaries, advocating for equitable, transparent, and regenerative AI systems
that prioritize both human and environmental well-being.

Motivation: To explore how AI-generated texts challenge human meaning-making and how Buddhist philosophy might adapt.

Method: Case study involving generating a fictional Buddhist sutra with a large language model and analyzing its philosophical and literary aspects.

Result: The generated sutra exhibited conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and dense allusion, making its mechanistic origin hard to dismiss.

Conclusion: Buddhist philosophy may be uniquely suited to adapt to AI's encroachment on human meaning-making.

Abstract: This paper presents a case study in the use of a large language model to
generate a fictional Buddhist "sutr"', and offers a detailed analysis of the
resulting text from a philosophical and literary point of view. The conceptual
subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard
to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin. This raises questions
about how we, as a society, should come to terms with the potentially

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spiking neural networks by addressing the limitations of hard and soft reset methods, which cause information loss or uniform treatment of neurons.

Method: Designs an adaptive reset neuron that correlates input, output, and reset, and integrates a threshold adjustment strategy.

Result: Achieves excellent performance on various datasets while maintaining low energy consumption.

Conclusion: The adaptive reset neuron effectively balances performance and energy efficiency in spiking neural networks.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks possess the advantage of low energy consumption due
to their event-driven nature. Compared with binary spike outputs, their
inherent floating-point dynamics are more worthy of attention. The threshold
level and reset mode of neurons play a crucial role in determining the number
and timing of spikes. The existing hard reset method causes information loss,
while the improved soft reset method adopts a uniform treatment for neurons. In
response to this, this paper designs an adaptive reset neuron, establishing the
correlation between input, output and reset, and integrating a simple yet
effective threshold adjustment strategy. It achieves excellent performance on
various datasets while maintaining the advantage of low energy consumption.

### [466] [Why Flow Matching is Particle Swarm Optimization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20810)

TL;DR: The paper explores the duality between flow matching in generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO), revealing their mathematical and optimization similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover intrinsic connections between flow matching and PSO, bridging generative models and evolutionary computation.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing mathematical formulations and optimization mechanisms of both approaches.

Result: Flow matching is a continuous generalization of PSO, and PSO is a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence, establishing a unified framework.

Conclusion: The duality suggests hybrid algorithm development and new research directions, improving both swarm intelligence and generative models.

Abstract: This paper preliminarily investigates the duality between flow matching in
generative models and particle swarm optimization (PSO) in evolutionary
computation. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the intrinsic connections
between these two approaches in terms of their mathematical formulations and
optimization mechanisms: the vector field learning in flow matching shares
similar mathematical expressions with the velocity update rules in PSO; both
methods follow the fundamental framework of progressive evolution from initial
to target distributions; and both can be formulated as dynamical systems
governed by ordinary differential equations. Our study demonstrates that flow
matching can be viewed as a continuous generalization of PSO, while PSO
provides a discrete implementation of swarm intelligence principles. This
duality understanding establishes a theoretical foundation for developing novel
hybrid algorithms and creates a unified framework for analyzing both methods.
Although this paper only presents preliminary discussions, the revealed
correspondences suggest several promising research directions, including
improving swarm intelligence algorithms based on flow matching principles and
enhancing generative models using swarm intelligence concepts.

TL;DR: MPaGE enhances SEMO with LLMs and PFG for multi-objective optimization, outperforming existing LLM-based methods and matching traditional MOEAs with faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional evolutionary algorithms for MOCOP require domain knowledge and tuning, limiting flexibility. LLMs offer potential for automatic heuristic generation but lack focus on multi-objective tasks, runtime efficiency, and diversity.

Method: MPaGE integrates LLMs into SEMO, using Pareto Front Grid (PFG) to partition the objective space and guide heuristic generation, prioritizing diverse logical structures.

Result: MPaGE outperforms LLM-based frameworks and matches traditional MOEAs, with significantly faster runtime.

Conclusion: MPaGE effectively bridges the gap in LLM-based multi-objective optimization, offering a flexible and efficient solution.

Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise
in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of
conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be
effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter
tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently,
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has
opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced
language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most
existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often
neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic
diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a
novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO)
framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By
partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing
candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize
heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus
promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through
extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing
LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional
Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster
runtime. Our code is available at: https://github.com/langkhachhoha/MPaGE.

Motivation: Existing studies overlook mission dependencies and offloading costs, leading to suboptimal decisions in ITS.

Method: Proposes CGG-ARO for one-slot optimization and MA-DDQN for multi-agent coordination, enhancing adaptability and efficiency.

processing. Existing studies often overlook the intricate interdependencies
between missions and the costs associated with offloading tasks to edge
servers, leading to suboptimal decision-making. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Oranits, a novel system model that explicitly accounts for mission
dependencies and offloading costs while optimizing performance through vehicle
cooperation. To achieve this, we propose a twofold optimization approach.
First, we develop a metaheuristic-based evolutionary computing algorithm,
namely the Chaotic Gaussian-based Global ARO (CGG-ARO), serving as a baseline
for one-slot optimization. Second, we design an enhanced reward-based deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, referred to as the Multi-agent Double
Deep Q-Network (MA-DDQN), that integrates both multi-agent coordination and
multi-action selection mechanisms, significantly reducing mission assignment
time and improving adaptability over baseline methods. Extensive simulations
reveal that CGG-ARO improves the number of completed missions and overall
benefit by approximately 7.1% and 7.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, MA-DDQN
achieves even greater improvements of 11.0% in terms of mission completions and
12.5% in terms of the overall benefit. These results highlight the
effectiveness of Oranits in enabling faster, more adaptive, and more efficient
task processing in dynamic ITS environments.

Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth investigation into the high-performance
parallel optimization of the Fish School Behaviour (FSB) algorithm on the
Setonix supercomputing platform using the OpenMP framework. Given the
increasing demand for enhanced computational capabilities for complex,
large-scale calculations across diverse domains, there's an imperative need for
optimized parallel algorithms and computing structures. The FSB algorithm,
inspired by nature's social behavior patterns, provides an ideal platform for
parallelization due to its iterative and computationally intensive nature. This
study leverages the capabilities of the Setonix platform and the OpenMP
framework to analyze various aspects of multi-threading, such as thread counts,
scheduling strategies, and OpenMP constructs, aiming to discern patterns and
strategies that can elevate program performance. Experiments were designed to
rigorously test different configurations, and our results not only offer
insights for parallel optimization of FSB on Setonix but also provide valuable
references for other parallel computational research using OpenMP. Looking

*Jonas H. Müller Korndörfer,Ali Mohammed,Ahmed Eleliemy,Quentin Guilloteau,Reto Krummenacher,Florina M. Ciorba*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper explores learning-based methods for selecting scheduling algorithms in OpenMP, comparing expert-based and reinforcement learning approaches. Results show RL can learn high-performing decisions but requires exploration, while expert methods rely on prior knowledge. Combining both improves performance and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern HPC systems require effective scheduling for performance, but selecting the right algorithm is challenging due to diverse workloads and systems.

Method: Proposes expert-based and RL-based methods for scheduling algorithm selection, evaluated across six applications and three systems.

Result: RL methods learn high-performing decisions but need exploration; expert methods are less exploratory but may not always be optimal. Combining both yields better performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic scheduling algorithm selection is viable and beneficial for OpenMP, with potential extension to MPI-based programs.

Abstract: Scientific and data science applications are becoming increasingly complex,
with growing computational and memory demands. Modern high performance
computing (HPC) systems provide high parallelism and heterogeneity across
nodes, devices, and cores. To achieve good performance, effective scheduling
and load balancing techniques are essential. Parallel programming frameworks
such as OpenMP now offer a variety of advanced scheduling algorithms to support
diverse applications and platforms. This creates an instance of the scheduling
algorithm selection problem, which involves identifying the most suitable
algorithm for a given combination of workload and system characteristics.
  In this work, we explore learning-based approaches for selecting scheduling
algorithms in OpenMP. We propose and evaluate expert-based and reinforcement
learning (RL)-based methods, and conduct a detailed performance analysis across
six applications and three systems. Our results show that RL methods are
capable of learning high-performing scheduling decisions, although they require
significant exploration, with the choice of reward function playing a key role.
Expert-based methods, in contrast, rely on prior knowledge and involve less
exploration, though they may not always identify the optimal algorithm for a
specific application-system pair. By combining expert knowledge with RL-based
learning, we achieve improved performance and greater adaptability.
  Overall, this work demonstrates that dynamic selection of scheduling
algorithms during execution is both viable and beneficial for OpenMP
applications. The approach can also be extended to MPI-based programs, enabling
optimization of scheduling decisions across multiple levels of parallelism.

### [471] [A Fast Parallel Median Filtering Algorithm Using Hierarchical Tiling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19926)
*Louis Sugy*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: A novel median filtering algorithm using hierarchical tiling achieves faster performance than existing methods, with variants offering $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$ complexities for $k \times k$ kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Median filtering is effective for noise removal but computationally expensive. Existing methods either scale poorly or have high constant factors.

Method: The paper introduces a hierarchical tiling approach with two variants: a data-oblivious selection network (register-based) and a data-aware version (RAM-based).

Result: The CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than state-of-the-art methods for various data types and kernel sizes.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is the fastest median filter in most cases, offering significant speed improvements.

Abstract: Median filtering is a non-linear smoothing technique widely used in digital
image processing to remove noise while retaining sharp edges. It is
particularly well suited to removing outliers (impulse noise) or granular
artifacts (speckle noise). However, the high computational cost of median
filtering can be prohibitive. Sorting-based algorithms excel with small kernels
but scale poorly with increasing kernel diameter, in contrast to constant-time
methods characterized by higher constant factors but better scalability, such
as histogram-based approaches or the 2D wavelet matrix.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm, leveraging the separability of the
sorting problem through hierarchical tiling to minimize redundant computations.
We propose two variants: a data-oblivious selection network that can operate
entirely within registers, and a data-aware version utilizing random-access
memory. These achieve per-pixel complexities of $O(k \log(k))$ and $O(k)$,
respectively, for a $k \times k$ kernel - unprecedented for sorting-based
methods. Our CUDA implementation is up to 5 times faster than the current state
of the art on a modern GPU and is the fastest median filter in most cases for
8-, 16-, and 32-bit data types and kernels from $3 \times 3$ to $75 \times 75$.

TL;DR: The paper reviews AI's role in enhancing cryoEM and cryoET workflows, addressing challenges like noise and orientation bias, and enabling high-resolution structural biology with minimal manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how deep learning integrates into cryoEM and cryoET workflows to overcome historical limitations like low signal-to-noise ratios and preferred orientation artifacts.

Method: Examines AI tools (e.g., Topaz, crYOLO, spIsoNet) for particle picking, denoising, orientation bias correction, and automated atomic model building.

Result: AI has enabled near-atomic resolution reconstructions, resolved intractable datasets, and applied to diverse biological systems.

Conclusion: Deep learning promises further automation and accessibility in structural biology, revolutionizing macromolecular understanding.

Abstract: The past decade's "cryoEM revolution" has produced exponential growth in
high-resolution structural data through advances in cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and tomography (cryoET). Deep learning integration into
structural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low
signal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge
problems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review
examines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated
particle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,
CryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias
(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In
cryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous
missing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines
subtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow
culminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like
ModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into
interpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved
near-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,
resolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation
bias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV
virus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes. As deep learning evolves,
particularly with large language models and vision transformers, the future
promises sophisticated automation and accessibility in structural biology,
potentially revolutionizing our understanding of macromolecular architecture
and function.

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: A toolbox for analyzing iterative algorithms in high-dimensional nonconvex optimization with random data, extending state evolution predictions to a broader class of methods and providing finite-sample guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generalize state evolution predictions beyond coordinate-wise separable updates and ensure rigorous, finite-sample analysis for a wider range of algorithms.

Method: Develops state evolution for methods with interleaved first-order and saddle point updates, using Hilbert space lifting and combining Bolthausen's conditioning with Gordon's Gaussian comparison.

Result: Established rigorous state evolution for non-separable updates and finite-sample guarantees for empirical updates.

Conclusion: The toolbox and technical toolkit advance analysis of iterative algorithms in high-dimensional nonconvex optimization, with potential broader applicability.

Abstract: We develop a toolbox for exact analysis of iterative algorithms on a class of
high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems with random data. While prior
work has shown that low-dimensional statistics of (generalized) first-order
methods can be predicted by a deterministic recursion known as state evolution,
our focus is on developing such a prediction for a more general class of
algorithms. We provide a state evolution for any method whose iterations are
given by (possibly interleaved) first-order and saddle point updates, showing
two main results. First, we establish a rigorous state evolution prediction
that holds even when the updates are not coordinate-wise separable. Second, we
establish finite-sample guarantees bounding the deviation of the empirical
updates from the established state evolution. In the process, we develop a
technical toolkit that may prove useful in related problems. One component of
this toolkit is a general Hilbert space lifting technique to prove existence
and uniqueness of a convenient parameterization of the state evolution. Another
component of the toolkit combines a generic application of Bolthausen's
conditioning method with a sequential variant of Gordon's Gaussian comparison
inequality, and provides additional ingredients that enable a general
finite-sample analysis.

### [475] [Extreme value theory for singular subspace estimation in the matrix denoising model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19978)
*Junhyung Chang,Joshua Cape*

Main category: math.ST

TL;DR: The paper studies singular subspace estimation in matrix denoising, showing the two-to-infinity norm of aligned differences follows a Gumbel distribution. It proposes a hypothesis test for low-rank signal structure with higher power for structured alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve hypothesis testing for low-rank signal structures in noisy matrices by leveraging the two-to-infinity norm, which detects structured alternatives more effectively than Frobenius norm.

Method: Uses entrywise matrix perturbation analysis, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation, and random matrix theory to derive asymptotic distributions and de-biased estimators.

Result: The two-to-infinity norm of aligned differences converges to the Gumbel distribution, enabling more powerful hypothesis tests for structured alternatives.

Conclusion: The proposed method outperforms Frobenius norm-based tests, especially for detecting localized deviations, and is robust to non-Gaussian noise.

Abstract: This paper studies fine-grained singular subspace estimation in the matrix
denoising model where a deterministic low-rank signal matrix is additively
perturbed by a stochastic matrix of Gaussian noise. We establish that the
maximum Euclidean row norm (i.e., the two-to-infinity norm) of the aligned
difference between the leading sample and population singular vectors
approaches the Gumbel distribution in the large-matrix limit, under suitable
signal-to-noise conditions and after appropriate centering and scaling. We
apply our novel asymptotic distributional theory to test hypotheses of low-rank
signal structure encoded in the leading singular vectors and their
corresponding principal subspace. We provide de-biased estimators for the
corresponding nuisance signal singular values and show that our proposed
plug-in test statistic has desirable properties. Notably, compared to using the
Frobenius norm subspace distance, our test statistic based on the
two-to-infinity norm has higher power to detect structured alternatives that
differ from the null in only a few matrix entries or rows. Our main results are
obtained by a novel synthesis of and technical analysis involving entrywise
matrix perturbation analysis, extreme value theory, saddle point approximation
methods, and random matrix theory. Our contributions complement the existing
literature for matrix denoising focused on minimaxity, mean squared error
analysis, unitarily invariant distances between subspaces, component-wise
asymptotic distributional theory, and row-wise uniform error bounds. Numerical
simulations illustrate our main results and demonstrate the robustness
properties of our testing procedure to non-Gaussian noise distributions.

TL;DR: Developed a Non-Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology using OWL and SWRL, validated with clinical scenarios and SPARQL queries, demonstrating rule-based reasoning and therapy recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support knowledge representation in acute care settings by organizing clinical concepts and enabling rule-based reasoning for NIRS.

Method: Used OWL semantics and Protege to build the ontology, added SWRL rules for reasoning, and validated with 17 hypothetical patient scenarios and SPARQL queries using eICU data.

Result: Ontology includes 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data properties with 882 axioms. SPARQL queries validated all test cases, showing accurate patient outcomes.

Conclusion: The NIRS ontology successfully unifies concepts, supports rule-based reasoning, and aligns with standardized vocabularies, aiding clinical documentation and analysis.

Abstract: Objective: Develop a Non Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology to
support knowledge representation in acute care settings.
  Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology
Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and
relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical
structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated
logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used
SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)
Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data
properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To
standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive
definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully
validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,
for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours
due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,
including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,
and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the
ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy
recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,
integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.
  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and
demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient
scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper compares behavioural cloning (BC) and reinforcement learning (RL) for training Guidance & Control Networks (G&CNETs) in spacecraft trajectory optimization, introducing a tailored RL framework. BC excels in replicating expert policies, while RL shows adaptability and can outperform suboptimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate BC and RL for training G&CNETs, addressing the lack of direct comparisons in literature and improving training stability and fairness.

Method: A novel RL framework for G&CNETs with decoupled action/control frequencies and reward redistribution, compared against BC on continuous-thrust spacecraft tasks.

Result: BC closely mimics expert policies but depends on dataset quality; RL adapts better to stochastic conditions and can discover superior solutions.

Conclusion: RL-trained G&CNETs offer advantages in adaptability and discovering optimal strategies, while BC is reliable for deterministic environments with high-quality data.

Abstract: Guidance & control networks (G&CNETs) provide a promising alternative to
on-board guidance and control (G&C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a
differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control
architecture. When training G&CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge:
behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement
learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors.
Although both approaches have been adopted in G&CNET related literature, direct
comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&CNETs on continuous-thrust
spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training
framework tailored to G&CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control
frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training
and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&CNETs
excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal
control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively
constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast
RL-trained G&CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic
conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert
demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the
generation of training samples.

TL;DR: IPIP is a framework for improving MLIP models iteratively, reducing prediction errors and speeding up simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between pretraining and downstream tasks in MLIPs, and reduce reliance on large labeled datasets.

Method: Iterative Pretraining for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP) with a forgetting mechanism to avoid suboptimal local minima.

Result: Achieves 80% error reduction and 4x speedup in the Mo-S-O system.

Conclusion: IPIP offers a lightweight, efficient solution for accurate MLIPs without extensive data or complex architectures.

Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy and have been applied across
various domains in physical science. However, their performance often relies on
large-scale labeled training data. While existing pretraining strategies can
improve model performance, they often suffer from a mismatch between the
objectives of pretraining and downstream tasks or rely on extensive labeled
datasets and increasingly complex architectures to achieve broad
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Iterative Pretraining
for Interatomic Potentials (IPIP), a framework designed to iteratively improve
the predictive performance of MLIP models. IPIP incorporates a forgetting
mechanism to prevent iterative training from converging to suboptimal local
minima. Unlike general-purpose foundation models, which frequently underperform
on specialized tasks due to a trade-off between generality and system-specific
accuracy, IPIP achieves higher accuracy and efficiency using lightweight
architectures. Compared to general-purpose force fields, this approach achieves
over 80% reduction in prediction error and up to 4x speedup in the challenging
Mo-S-O system, enabling fast and accurate simulations.

Main category: math.AG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the manifold hypothesis for LLM token embeddings, identifies geometric singularities around polysemous tokens, and proposes a scheme-theoretic blow-up method to resolve these singularities, ensuring representational stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the representational instability caused by geometric singularities in LLM token embeddings, which existing smooth manifold-based methods fail to handle.

Method: The method involves applying scheme-theoretic blow-up at singular points, replacing them with exceptional divisors (projective spaces) to disambiguate semantic meanings.

Result: The paper proves that this desingularization process resolves the original pathologies, ensuring geometric regularization of the embedding space.

Conclusion: The conclusion advocates for a shift from static embedding look-ups to dynamic, geometrically-grounded computation in LLM architectures.

Abstract: Recent work has provided compelling evidence challenging the foundational
manifold hypothesis for the token embedding spaces of Large Language Models
(LLMs). These findings reveal the presence of geometric singularities around
polysemous tokens, which can lead to representational instability. Existing
methodologies, which presuppose a smooth data manifold, are ill-equipped to
address such intrinsic structural flaws. In this paper, we formalize this
problem in the language of scheme theory and propose a rigorous resolution by
applying the scheme-theoretic blow-up at each singular point. This procedure
replaces a singular point in the ambient affine scheme with its exceptional
divisor, which we identify as a canonical geometric space -- a projective space
of directions -- that houses the disambiguated semantic meanings of the token.
This process of ``representational desingularization'' constructs a new
geometric landscape for embeddings. We prove a formal theorem guaranteeing the
geometric regularization of this new space, showing that the original
pathologies are resolved. Finally, we outline the architectural implications of
our framework, arguing for a paradigm shift from static look-ups to dynamic,
geometrically-grounded computation.

TL;DR: ChoreoMuse is a diffusion-based framework for generating high-quality, style-controllable dance videos that align with music and dancer characteristics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to produce dance videos that harmonize with music and user-defined styles, limiting real-world creative applications.

Method: Uses SMPL parameters and MotionTune encoder to link music to video generation, ensuring beat alignment and style adherence. Introduces new metrics for evaluation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style adherence.

Conclusion: ChoreoMuse is a robust solution for automated choreography generation across diverse musical genres and dancer characteristics.

Abstract: Modern artistic productions increasingly demand automated choreography
generation that adapts to diverse musical styles and individual dancer
characteristics. Existing approaches often fail to produce high-quality dance
videos that harmonize with both musical rhythm and user-defined choreography
styles, limiting their applicability in real-world creative contexts. To
address this gap, we introduce ChoreoMuse, a diffusion-based framework that
uses SMPL format parameters and their variation version as intermediaries
between music and video generation, thereby overcoming the usual constraints
imposed by video resolution. Critically, ChoreoMuse supports
style-controllable, high-fidelity dance video generation across diverse musical
genres and individual dancer characteristics, including the flexibility to
handle any reference individual at any resolution. Our method employs a novel
music encoder MotionTune to capture motion cues from audio, ensuring that the
generated choreography closely follows the beat and expressive qualities of the
input music. To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match
both musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that
measure alignment with the intended stylistic cues. Extensive experiments
confirm that ChoreoMuse achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple
dimensions, including video quality, beat alignment, dance diversity, and style
adherence, demonstrating its potential as a robust solution for a wide range of
creative applications. Video results can be found on our project page:

TL;DR: A novel radiance caching method for path-traced volume rendering improves rendering quality and reduces noise without increasing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic rendering in scientific visualization faces challenges like slow performance and high pixel variance due to Monte Carlo integration.

Method: The approach uses a trainable, multi-level radiance cache based on 3D Gaussian splatting, adapting dynamically to scene changes.

Result: The method produces less noisy, higher-quality images compared to baseline and state-of-the-art techniques, maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The path-space radiance cache is a robust, easy-to-integrate solution that enhances volumetric visualization rendering quality.

Abstract: Real-time path tracing is rapidly becoming the standard for rendering in
entertainment and professional applications. In scientific visualization,
volume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and
interpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have
gained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant
challenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and
high pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we
introduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.
Our method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D
Gaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.
This cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to
changes in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer
functions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality
images without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare
it against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event
estimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching. Through both
quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that our path-space
radiance cache is a robust solution that is easy to integrate and significantly
enhances the rendering quality of volumetric visualization applications while
maintaining comparable computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding using unconstrained photo collections, extending 3D Gaussian splatting with language embedding and introducing new methods for feature extraction and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods focus on 3D reconstruction but lack immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which is limited to static text-image pairs.

Method: Extends language-embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), extracts multi-appearance CLIP features, and introduces uncertainty maps, an autoencoder, and a post-ensemble strategy for feature fusion.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, enabling accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and applications like interactive roaming and architectural style recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances immersive 3D scene understanding, demonstrating effectiveness in open-vocabulary tasks and practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D
reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and
historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the
immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which
remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we
draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use
unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for
understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we
extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel
framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo
collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the
same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance
field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language
feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the
multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next,
we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance
language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively
compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally,
to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark
dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained
photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms
existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling
applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries,
architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

*Xin Zhang,Anpei Chen,Jincheng Xiong,Pinxuan Dai,Yujun Shen,Weiwei Xu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural shell texture to disentangle geometry and appearance in Gaussian splatting, improving efficiency and detail reconstruction with fewer primitives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian splatting techniques require many primitives due to entangled geometry and appearance, limiting efficiency.

Method: A neural shell texture is introduced as a global representation, using Gaussian primitives for geometry and texture sampling.

Result: The method achieves high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail, and easy mesh extraction with fewer primitives.

Conclusion: Disentangling geometry and appearance in Gaussian splatting enhances efficiency and detail reconstruction.

Abstract: Gaussian splatting techniques have shown promising results in novel view
synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using
significantly fewer primitives.

### [484] [Towards Generalized Parameter Tuning in Coherent Ising Machines: A Portfolio-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20295)
*Tatsuro Hanyu,Takahiro Katagiri,Daichi Mukunoki,Tetsuya Hoshino*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: The paper introduces an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) using the Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in CIMs is challenging due to sensitivity to many parameters, and existing methods lack efficiency.

Method: Proposes two tuning methods (Method A and Method B) combining sequential optimization and prioritization strategies.

Result: Method A improved performance by 1.47x, and Method B by 1.65x over baseline.

Conclusion: The algorithm portfolio approach effectively enhances hyperparameter tuning for CIMs.

Abstract: Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) have recently gained attention as a promising
computing model for solving combinatorial optimization problems. In particular,
the Chaotic Amplitude Control (CAC) algorithm has demonstrated high solution
quality, but its performance is highly sensitive to a large number of
hyperparameters, making efficient tuning essential. In this study, we present
an algorithm portfolio approach for hyperparameter tuning in CIMs employing
Chaotic Amplitude Control with momentum (CACm) algorithm. Our method
incorporates multiple search strategies, enabling flexible and effective
adaptation to the characteristics of the hyperparameter space. Specifically, we
propose two representative tuning methods, Method A and Method B. Method A
optimizes each hyperparameter sequentially with a fixed total number of trials,
while Method B prioritizes hyperparameters based on initial evaluations before
applying Method A in order. Performance evaluations were conducted on the
Supercomputer "Flow" at Nagoya University, using planted Wishart instances and
Time to Solution (TTS) as the evaluation metric. Compared to the baseline
performance with best-known hyperparameters, Method A achieved up to 1.47x
improvement, and Method B achieved up to 1.65x improvement. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm portfolio approach in enhancing
the tuning process for CIMs.

*Harsh Purohit,Tomoya Nishida,Kota Dohi,Takashi Endo,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Proposes an LLM-based method to generate synthetic anomalies for evaluating unsupervised anomalous sound detection (UASD) systems without real anomaly data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods lack scalability and realism, while advanced models require anomalous data, which is often unavailable.

Method: Uses LLMs to interpret fault descriptions and apply audio transformations to normal sounds, creating diverse synthetic anomalies.

Result: Synthetic anomalies show consistent detection difficulty trends with real anomalies across machine types.

Conclusion: The LLM-based approach effectively enables relative evaluation of UASD systems without real anomaly data.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for generating machine-type-specific anomalies
to evaluate the relative performance of unsupervised anomalous sound detection
(UASD) systems across different machine types, even in the absence of real
anomaly sound data. Conventional keyword-based data augmentation methods often
produce unrealistic sounds due to their reliance on manually defined labels,
limiting scalability as machine types and anomaly patterns diversify. Advanced
audio generative models, such as MIMII-Gen, show promise but typically depend
on anomalous training data, making them less effective when diverse anomalous
examples are unavailable. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
synthesis approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) to interpret textual
descriptions of faults and automatically select audio transformation functions,
converting normal machine sounds into diverse and plausible anomalous sounds.
We validate this approach by evaluating a UASD system trained only on normal
sounds from five machine types, using both real and synthetic anomaly data.
Experimental results reveal consistent trends in relative detection difficulty
across machine types between synthetic and real anomalies. This finding
supports our hypothesis and highlights the effectiveness of the proposed
LLM-based synthesis approach for relative evaluation of UASD systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO's success in discrete spaces hasn't been applied to continuous control, limiting its use in robotics.

Method: Introduces trajectory-based policy clustering, state-aware advantage estimation, and regularized policy updates.

Result: Theoretical framework and analysis of convergence and computational complexity.

Conclusion: Lays groundwork for empirical validation in robotic tasks like locomotion and manipulation.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown promise in discrete

TL;DR: FP-LGN grounds spatial language to improve robot sensing by fusing human observations with robot data, using uncertainty-aware fusion for better task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address sensing limitations in robots during collaborative tasks by leveraging human observations with grounded uncertainty.

Method: Developed FP-LGN, a model that learns map image features and spatial relation semantics, trained via three-stage curriculum learning to estimate aleatoric uncertainty.

Result: FP-LGN matched expert rules in NLL, showed robustness, and improved human-robot task performance through uncertainty-aware fusion.

Conclusion: FP-LGN effectively grounds human language for uncertainty-aware fusion, enhancing collaborative sensing and task outcomes.

Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing
limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion
framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human
inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network
(FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features
and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained
as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language
using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched
expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated
greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results
demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled
uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot
sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot
collaborative task performance.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the potential of AI in robotics, identifies challenges in applying AI to physical-world tasks, and proposes a research roadmap for future advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage AI breakthroughs for overcoming barriers in robotics and ensuring effective human-robot collaboration.

Method: Assessment of AI achievements in robotics since the 1990s and proposing a research roadmap.

Result: Identifies key challenges like dataset diversity, algorithm design, explainability, and lifelong learning.

Conclusion: AI in robotics requires tailored solutions, transparency, and safety for long-term success.

Abstract: AI technologies, including deep learning, large-language models have gone
from one breakthrough to the other. As a result, we are witnessing growing
excitement in robotics at the prospect of leveraging the potential of AI to
tackle some of the outstanding barriers to the full deployment of robots in our
daily lives. However, action and sensing in the physical world pose greater and
different challenges than analysing data in isolation. As the development and
application of AI in robotic products advances, it is important to reflect on
which technologies, among the vast array of network architectures and learning
models now available in the AI field, are most likely to be successfully
applied to robots; how they can be adapted to specific robot designs, tasks,
environments; which challenges must be overcome. This article offers an
assessment of what AI for robotics has achieved since the 1990s and proposes a
short- and medium-term research roadmap listing challenges and promises. These
range from keeping up-to-date large datasets, representatives of a diversity of
tasks robots may have to perform, and of environments they may encounter, to
designing AI algorithms tailored specifically to robotics problems but generic
enough to apply to a wide range of applications and transfer easily to a
variety of robotic platforms. For robots to collaborate effectively with
humans, they must predict human behavior without relying on bias-based
profiling. Explainability and transparency in AI-driven robot control are not
optional but essential for building trust, preventing misuse, and attributing
responsibility in accidents. We close on what we view as the primary long-term
challenges, that is, to design robots capable of lifelong learning, while
guaranteeing safe deployment and usage, and sustainable computational costs.

*Yuhong Deng,Chao Tang,Cunjun Yu,Linfeng Li,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLASP introduces semantic keypoints for general-purpose clothes manipulation, bridging high-level planning and low-level execution, outperforming baselines in simulations and real-robot tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for clothes manipulation are limited to specific tasks and types due to clothes' complex geometry. CLASP aims to generalize across diverse clothes and tasks.

Method: CLASP uses semantic keypoints (e.g., 'left sleeve') extracted from RGB-D images to represent clothes. It combines vision language models (VLMs) for task planning and a skill library for execution.

Result: CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simulations and real-robot experiments, showing strong generalization across tasks (folding, hanging, etc.) and clothes types.

Conclusion: CLASP's semantic keypoints effectively generalize clothes manipulation, demonstrating robust performance in both simulation and real-world settings.

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability
for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain
limited to specific tasks and clothes types, due to the complex,
high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation
with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes
manipulation over different clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long
dresses, ... , as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, ... .
The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints -- e.g., ''left sleeve'', ''right
shoulder'', etc. -- a sparse spatial-semantic representation that is salient
for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably
extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate
representation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints
to bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high
level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the
semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a
simple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments
show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks
across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and
generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four
distinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's
performance on a real robot.

*Matin Aghaei,Mohammad Ali Alomrani,Yingxue Zhang,Mahdi Biparva*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper questions the role of LLMs in improving ObjectGoal Navigation, showing that a geometry-based heuristic (DWFE) outperforms previous methods, and adding a lightweight language prior (SHF) further enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether LLMs truly enhance planning in ObjectGoal Navigation or if simpler methods like geometry-based heuristics are more effective.

Method: Replaced LLM-based components with a Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE) and added a lightweight language prior (SHF) for evaluation.

Result: DWFE improved Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and SPL from 20.9% to 36.0%. SHF further increased Success by +2% and SPL by +0.9%, with shorter paths.

Conclusion: Frontier geometry, not LLM reasoning, drives most gains. Metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are needed before attributing success to LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often credited with recent leaps in
ObjectGoal Navigation, yet the extent to which they improve planning remains
unclear. We revisit this question on the HM3D-v1 validation split. First, we
strip InstructNav of its Dynamic Chain-of-Navigation prompt, open-vocabulary
GLEE detector and Intuition saliency map, and replace them with a simple
Distance-Weighted Frontier Explorer (DWFE). This geometry-only heuristic raises
Success from 58.0% to 61.1% and lifts SPL from 20.9% to 36.0% over 2 000
validation episodes, outperforming all previous training-free baselines.
Second, we add a lightweight language prior (SHF); on a 200-episode subset this
yields a further +2% Success and +0.9% SPL while shortening paths by five steps
on average. Qualitative trajectories confirm the trend: InstructNav back-tracks
and times-out, DWFE reaches the goal after a few islands, and SHF follows an
almost straight route. Our results indicate that frontier geometry, not
emergent LLM reasoning, drives most reported gains, and suggest that
metric-aware prompts or offline semantic graphs are necessary before
attributing navigation success to "LLM intelligence."

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes a PPO-trained adaptive degeneracy optimization agent (DOA) to address degeneracy in 2D-SLAM for indoor environments, overcoming data, quality, and annotation challenges with a specialized reward function and transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor environments like corridors cause degeneracy in SLAM, which traditional methods struggle to address due to data and training limitations.

Method: Uses PPO to train DOA with a reward function and transfer learning, dynamically adjusting sensor contributions based on degeneracy factors.

Result: DOA outperforms SOTA methods in degeneracy detection and optimization across environments, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed DOA effectively mitigates SLAM degeneracy with adaptive optimization and transfer learning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Particle filter-based 2D-SLAM is widely used in indoor localization tasks due
to its efficiency. However, indoor environments such as long straight corridors
can cause severe degeneracy problems in SLAM. In this paper, we use Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an adaptive degeneracy optimization agent
(DOA) to address degeneracy problem. We propose a systematic methodology to
address three critical challenges in traditional supervised learning
frameworks: (1) data acquisition bottlenecks in degenerate dataset, (2)
inherent quality deterioration of training samples, and (3) ambiguity in
annotation protocol design. We design a specialized reward function to guide
the agent in developing perception capabilities for degenerate environments.
Using the output degeneracy factor as a reference weight, the agent can
dynamically adjust the contribution of different sensors to pose optimization.
Specifically, the observation distribution is shifted towards the motion model
distribution, with the step size determined by a linear interpolation formula
related to the degeneracy factor. In addition, we employ a transfer learning
module to endow the agent with generalization capabilities across different
environments and address the inefficiency of training in degenerate
environments. Finally, we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate the
rationality of our model design and the role of transfer learning. We also
compare the proposed DOA with SOTA methods to prove its superior degeneracy
detection and optimization capabilities across various environments.

Conclusion: Humanoid Occupancy enhances environmental perception and standardizes visual modules, enabling broader deployment of humanoid robots in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified digital and robotic twinning framework for validating multi-modal GNC systems in spacecraft RPO and FF, demonstrating consistency between simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Validating GNC systems for spacecraft RPO and FF is challenging due to space environment complexity, requiring a robust V&V process.

Method: A hybrid framework combining digital and robotic twins, using testbeds (GRAND, TRON, OS) for RF- and vision-based navigation validation.

Result: Consistency between digital and robotic twins was achieved, validating the framework for realistic GNC system assessment.

Conclusion: The hybrid twinning pipeline is reliable for verifying GNC systems, bridging simulation and real-world behavior.

Abstract: In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-guided adaptive compensator framework for robotics, outperforming traditional adaptive controllers and reducing reasoning complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs in adaptive control, addressing limitations of prior work like simplified systems and lack of real-world validation.

Method: Inspired by MRAC, the framework uses LLMs to design compensators aligning unknown systems with reference systems.

Result: The LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms traditional methods, reduces reasoning complexity, and shows strong generalizability.

Conclusion: This work advances LLM applications in automatic control, offering practical and deployable solutions.

Abstract: With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and
practicality compared to vision-language models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes methods for detecting navigable surfaces in truss structures using binary segmentation of 3D point clouds, comparing analytical algorithms and deep learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspection and maintenance of reticular structures are costly and hazardous, requiring autonomous solutions. Prior work lacks focus on autonomous navigation within such structures.

Method: Two approaches are introduced: an analytical algorithm using eigendecomposition of planar patches, and deep learning models (PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, PointTransformerV3).

Result: The analytical method is easier to tune and performs comparably to deep learning models, which excel in accuracy (e.g., PointTransformerV3 achieves 97% mIoU).

Conclusion: Both methods show promise for autonomous navigation in truss structures, with trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy, guiding future research and applications.

Abstract: Reticular structures form the backbone of major infrastructure like bridges,
pylons, and airports, but their inspection and maintenance are costly and
hazardous, often requiring human intervention. While prior research has focused
on fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous
navigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study
addresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss
structures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces
several approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus
background from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into
two categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical
approach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the
eigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced
deep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3
are trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that
the analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance
comparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally
intensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves
a Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%. The study demonstrates the
promise of both analytical and deep learning methods for improving autonomous
navigation in complex truss environments. The results highlight the trade-offs
between computational efficiency and segmentation performance, providing
valuable guidance for future research and practical applications in autonomous
infrastructure inspection and maintenance.

TL;DR: LanternNet, an autonomous robotic system, effectively detects and suppresses invasive spotted lanternflies (SLF), outperforming traditional methods in cost, scalability, and environmental impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLF control methods are labor-intensive, environmentally harmful, and ineffective long-term, necessitating a scalable, autonomous solution.

Method: LanternNet uses a central hub with YOLOv8 for SLF detection and three robotic spokes for neutralization, monitoring, and navigation.

Result: Field tests showed significant SLF population reductions (p < 0.01) and improved tree health, with cost and scalability advantages.

Conclusion: LanternNet exemplifies the potential of robotics and AI in invasive species management, offering adaptability for broader ecological applications.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to
agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods,
such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive,
environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This
research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system
designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central,
tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF
identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest
neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field
deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated
LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p
< 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in
tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to
conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and
improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced
autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential
for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative
potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species
management and improved environmental outcomes.

Conclusion: The method enables versatile manipulation while maintaining robustness against disturbances.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation of quadrupedal robots has broadened robotic applications,
but using legs as manipulators often compromises locomotion, while mounting
arms complicates the system. To mitigate this issue, we introduce bipedalism
for quadrupedal robots, thus freeing the front legs for versatile interactions
with the environment. We propose a risk-adaptive distributional Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework designed for quadrupedal robots walking on their hind
legs, balancing worst-case conservativeness with optimal performance in this
inherently unstable task. During training, the adaptive risk preference is
dynamically adjusted based on the uncertainty of the return, measured by the
coefficient of variation of the estimated return distribution. Extensive
experiments in simulation show our method's superior performance over
baselines. Real-world deployment on a Unitree Go2 robot further demonstrates
the versatility of our policy, enabling tasks like cart pushing, obstacle
probing, and payload transport, while showcasing robustness against challenging
dynamics and external disturbances.

### [498] [Free Energy-Inspired Cognitive Risk Integration for AV Navigation in Pedestrian-Rich Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20850)
*Meiting Dang,Yanping Wu,Yafei Wang,Dezong Zhao,David Flynn,Chongfeng Wei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel framework for AV-pedestrian interactions integrates cognitive modeling and risk-aware decision-making, improving safety and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack human-like adaptability in AV-pedestrian interactions, especially in dynamic environments.

Method: Uses a cognitive-risk social force model for pedestrians and a risk-aware graph convolutional network for AV decision-making.

Result: Simulations show improved safety, efficiency, and smoothness in AV navigation.

Conclusion: The framework enhances realistic interaction dynamics between AVs and pedestrians.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous vehicle (AV) behavior planning have shown
impressive social interaction capabilities when interacting with other road
users. However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in
interactions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex
multi-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on
crowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to
AVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic
boundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed
behavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling
interactions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a
cognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is
integrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic
interaction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk
Social Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused
measure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like
trajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a
dynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a
Soft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and
informed decisions. Simulation results indicate that our proposed framework
effectively improves safety, efficiency, and smoothness of AV navigation
compared to the state-of-the-art method.

Main category: q-fin.TR

TL;DR: MountainLion is a multi-modal, multi-agent system using LLM-based agents to integrate and interpret financial data for trading, improving returns and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods lack interpretability and require large datasets; MountainLion leverages LLMs for better decision-making.

Method: Coordinates specialized LLM agents to process textual news, charts, and signals, with a reflection module for continuous improvement.

Result: Enriches trading signals with contextual data, improving returns and investor confidence.

Conclusion: MountainLion offers a robust, interpretable, and actionable framework for financial trading.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading is a challenging task requiring the integration of
heterogeneous data from multiple modalities. Traditional deep learning and
reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and
encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of
interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents
has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex
investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present
\textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading
that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and
generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news,
candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial
reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment
recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A
central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to
continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time
report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment
strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches
technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow
signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment
framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.

### [500] [A Theory of $θ$-Expectations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20353)
*Qian Qi*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper develops a framework for stochastic calculus under non-convex ambiguity, introducing θ-BSDEs with a pointwise maximization driver. It ensures well-posedness and connects to nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stochastic calculus under ambiguity is insensitive to non-convex uncertainty, causing identifiability issues. This work aims to address this gap.

Method: Introduces θ-BSDEs with a driver determined by maximization over a non-convex set. Uses global analytic hypotheses and fixed-point arguments for well-posedness.

Result: Establishes well-posedness under global Lipschitz conditions and pathwise uniqueness under Malliavin non-degeneracy. Connects to nonlinear PDEs.

Conclusion: The framework resolves identifiability for non-convex ambiguity, offering a dynamically consistent expectation and linking to PDEs.

Abstract: The canonical theory of stochastic calculus under ambiguity, founded on
sub-additivity, is insensitive to non-convex uncertainty structures, leading to
an identifiability impasse. This paper develops a mathematical framework for an
identifiable calculus sensitive to non-convex geometry. We introduce the
$\theta$-BSDE, a class of backward stochastic differential equations where the
driver is determined by a pointwise maximization over a primitive, possibly
non-convex, uncertainty set. The system's tractability is predicated not on
convexity, but on a global analytic hypothesis: the existence of a unique and
globally Lipschitz maximizer map for the driver function. Under this
hypothesis, which carves out a tractable class of models, we establish
well-posedness via a fixed-point argument. For a distinct, geometrically
regular class of models, we prove a result of independent interest: under
non-degeneracy conditions from Malliavin calculus, the maximizer is unique
along any solution path, ensuring the model's internal consistency. We clarify
the fundamental logical gap between this pathwise property and the global
regularity required by our existence proof. The resulting valuation operator
defines a dynamically consistent expectation, and we establish its connection
to fully nonlinear PDEs via a Feynman-Kac formula.

*Nadeen Fathallah,Daniel Hernández,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AccessGuru automates detection and correction of web accessibility violations using a novel taxonomy and LLMs, outperforming prior methods with an 84% average violation score decrease.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most web pages lack accessibility compliance, excluding users with diverse abilities. Manual efforts are costly, so automation is needed to promote inclusiveness.

Method: Introduces a taxonomy (Syntactic, Semantic, Layout) and combines accessibility tools with LLMs for detection and correction via taxonomy-driven prompting.

Result: AccessGuru reduces violations by 84%, surpassing prior methods (max 50%), and is evaluated on a real-world benchmark.

Conclusion: AccessGuru effectively automates accessibility compliance, significantly improving over existing solutions.

Abstract: The vast majority of Web pages fail to comply with established Web
accessibility guidelines, excluding a range of users with diverse abilities
from interacting with their content. Making Web pages accessible to all users
requires dedicated expertise and additional manual efforts from Web page
providers. To lower their efforts and promote inclusiveness, we aim to
automatically detect and correct Web accessibility violations in HTML code.
While previous work has made progress in detecting certain types of
accessibility violations, the problem of automatically detecting and correcting
accessibility violations remains an open challenge that we address. We
introduce a novel taxonomy classifying Web accessibility violations into three
key categories - Syntactic, Semantic, and Layout. This taxonomy provides a
structured foundation for developing our detection and correction method and
redefining evaluation metrics. We propose a novel method, AccessGuru, which
combines existing accessibility testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
to detect violations and applies taxonomy-driven prompting strategies to
correct all three categories. To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a
benchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies
syntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through
comparative analysis with human expert corrections. Evaluation against our
benchmark shows that AccessGuru achieves up to 84% average violation score
decrease, significantly outperforming prior methods that achieve at most 50%.

### [502] [The Impact of Fine-tuning Large Language Models on Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19909)
*Roman Macháček,Anastasiia Grishina,Max Hort,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study explores the impact of fine-tuning techniques on LLMs for Automated Program Repair (APR), finding parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and IA3 outperform full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM performance in APR with lower computational costs by evaluating fine-tuning techniques.

Method: Empirical investigation of six LLMs (e.g., CodeGen, CodeLlama-2) on three APR benchmarks using no fine-tuning, full fine-tuning, and PEFT (LoRA, IA3).

Result: Full fine-tuning reduces performance due to data distribution issues and overfitting, while PEFT methods yield better results.

Conclusion: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning is more effective for adapting LLMs to APR tasks compared to full fine-tuning.

Abstract: Automated Program Repair (APR) uses various tools and techniques to help
developers achieve functional and error-free code faster. In recent years,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity as components in APR tool
chains because of their performance and flexibility. However, training such
models requires a significant amount of resources. Fine-tuning techniques have
been developed to adapt pre-trained LLMs to specific tasks, such as APR, and
enhance their performance at far lower computational costs than training from
scratch. In this study, we empirically investigate the impact of various
fine-tuning techniques on the performance of LLMs used for APR. Our experiments
provide insights into the performance of a selection of state-of-the-art LLMs
pre-trained on code. The evaluation is done on three popular APR benchmarks
(i.e., QuixBugs, Defects4J and HumanEval-Java) and considers six different LLMs
with varying parameter sizes (resp. CodeGen, CodeT5, StarCoder, DeepSeekCoder,
Bloom, and CodeLlama-2). We consider three training regimens: no fine-tuning,
full fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using LoRA and
IA3. We observe that full fine-tuning techniques decrease the benchmarking
performance of various models due to different data distributions and
overfitting. By using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, we restrict
models in the amount of trainable parameters and achieve better results.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen), a framework for ethical practices in code generation models, identifies 11 dimensions through literature review and practitioner surveys, and highlights overlooked social issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing concerns about ethical issues in AI-based code generation (e.g., licensing, privacy, fairness) necessitate a structured approach to ensure responsible practices.

Method: A two-phase literature review of 803 papers and a survey of 32 practitioners, including affected developers, to refine dimensions of ES-CodeGen.

Result: Identified 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen, including a new focus on code quality, and highlighted consequences, artifacts, and stages. Practitioners acknowledged improved understanding but often ignored social dimensions.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the need for addressing ethical issues in code generation and calls for greater attention to social-related dimensions in ES-CodeGen practices.

Abstract: Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and
effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are
growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing,
privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching
goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing
attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we
introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to
refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development
from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices.
To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review
where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code
generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of
ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of
ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who
submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users
have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation
models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension
on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified
consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey
reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related
dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or
strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen.
Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.

*Le Deng,Xiaoxue Ren,Chao Ni,Ming Liang,David Lo,Zhongxin Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A method to infer internal API information for project-specific code completion, improving accuracy by constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, and validated by outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval-augmented generation methods for code completion struggle with incorporating internal API information, especially when APIs are not explicitly imported.

Method: Extends API representation by constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, creating a knowledge base for LLMs, and introduces ProjBench for evaluation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by 22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%, with further boosts when integrated with baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenge of incorporating internal API information, significantly enhancing code completion accuracy.

Abstract: Project-specific code completion is a critical task that leverages context
from a project to generate accurate code. State-of-the-art methods use
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) and
project information for code completion. However, they often struggle to
incorporate internal API information, which is crucial for accuracy, especially
when APIs are not explicitly imported in the file.
  To address this, we propose a method to infer internal API information
without relying on imports. Our method extends the representation of APIs by
constructing usage examples and semantic descriptions, building a knowledge
base for LLMs to generate relevant completions. We also introduce ProjBench, a
benchmark that avoids leaked imports and consists of large-scale real-world
projects.
  Experiments on ProjBench and CrossCodeEval show that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, improving code exact match by
22.72% and identifier exact match by 18.31%. Additionally, integrating our
method with existing baselines boosts code match by 47.80% and identifier match
by 35.55%.

*Xinlong Zhao,Tong Jia,Minghua He,Yihan Wu,Ying Li,Gang Huang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FreeLog introduces a zero-label cross-system log anomaly detection method, eliminating the need for labeled target logs, and matches state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing log anomaly detection methods require labeled data, posing challenges in real-world applications. Cross-system transfer is promising but still relies on some labeled target logs, leading to cold-start issues.

Method: FreeLog uses a system-agnostic representation meta-learning approach to enable anomaly detection without labeled target logs.

Result: Experiments on three public datasets show FreeLog performs comparably to methods requiring labeled target data.

Conclusion: FreeLog successfully addresses the zero-label challenge in cross-system log anomaly detection, offering practical advantages.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and
reliability of software systems. However, existing approaches rely on large
amounts of labeled log data, which poses significant challenges in real-world
applications. To address this issue, cross-system transfer has been identified
as a key research direction. State-of-the-art cross-system approaches achieve
promising performance with only a few labels from the target system. However,
their reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start
problem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we
explore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly
detection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we
propose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that
eliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log
anomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three
public log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the
target system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To help enterprises, especially SMEs, adapt to digital transformation by adopting process-oriented production models.

Method: Starts with simple text-based knowledge artefacts, progressing to formal representations, enabling shared stakeholder participation.

Result: Produces a diagrammatic workflow of the target process, accessible to all stakeholders.

Conclusion: The method supports collaborative and structured business process design, aiding digital transformation.

Abstract: Enterprises are currently undergoing profound transformations due to the
unpostponable digital transformation. Then, to remain competitive, enterprises
must adapt their organisational structures and operations. This organisational
shift is also important for small and medium-sized enterprises. A key
innovation frontier is the adoption of process-oriented production models. This
paper presents a knowledge-based method to support business experts in
designing business processes. The method requires no prior expertise in
Knowledge Engineering and guides designers through a structured sequence of
steps to produce a diagrammatic workflow of the target process. The
construction of the knowledge base starts from simple, text-based, knowledge
artefacts and then progresses towards more structured, formal representations.
The approach has been conceived to allow a shared approach for all stakeholders
and actors who participate in the BP design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate complex software development tasks by leveraging cooperative LLM agents, addressing single-agent limitations.

Method: Specialized agents collaborate: Planner decomposes tasks, Coder implements, Debugger fixes, Reviewer validates. Includes prompt strategies and workflow orchestration.

Result: Case study demonstrates handling non-trivial tasks via planning, coding, debugging, and reviewing.

Conclusion: Dividing responsibilities among agents leverages LLM strengths and mitigates limitations, though challenges like error propagation remain for future work.

Abstract: Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally
requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose
AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered
agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents
- a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a
high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first
decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements
each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the
Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We
describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication,
and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow
orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial
development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative
debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities
among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while
mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations -
such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward
more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering
automation.

*Zhanhang Xiong,Dongxia Wang,Yuekang Li,Xinyuan An,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CrossPL is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperable code, revealing current models' limitations in this area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for LLMs to generate correct CPL-interoperating code for complex systems integrating multiple languages via IPC is underexplored.

Method: CrossPL was created by analyzing GitHub repositories using FSMs and an LLM-based pipeline to extract, generate, and validate CPL tasks.

Result: Evaluation of 20 LLMs showed poor performance in CPL scenarios, highlighting the need for further research.

Conclusion: CrossPL provides a foundation for advancing LLMs' CPL capabilities, with open access to the benchmark and code.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in software
engineering workflows, a critical capability remains underexplored: generating
correct code that enables cross-programming-language (CPL) interoperability.
This skill is essential for building complex systems that integrate components
written in multiple languages via mechanisms like inter-process communication
(IPC). To bridge this gap, we present CrossPL, the first benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to generate CPL-interoperating code.
CrossPL comprises 1,982 tasks centered around IPC, covering six widely-used
programming languages and seven representative CPL techniques. We construct
this benchmark by (i) analyzing 19,169 multi-language GitHub repositories using
156 hand-crafted finite state machines (FSMs), and (ii) developing an LLM-based
pipeline that automatically extracts CPL code snippets, generates task
instructions, and validates functional correctness. We evaluate 14
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs and 6 code-oriented LLMs released in the
past three years on CrossPL via FSM-based validation. Results reveal that even
the best-performing models struggle with CPL scenarios, underscoring the need
for more targeted research in this space. Our benchmark and code are available

TL;DR: The paper explores the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with code preferences, proposing APO as an adaptive method that outperforms existing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal training strategy for aligning LLMs with diverse code preferences, given unclear effectiveness of SFT and DPO across scenarios.

Method: Theoretical analysis and empirical experiments compare SFT, DPO, and their combination (S&D), leading to the proposal of APO for adaptive preference optimization.

Result: APO consistently matches or surpasses SFT and S&D in six code preference tasks, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: APO provides a dynamic and superior approach for aligning LLMs with code preferences, offering theoretical and practical guidance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear
across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically
investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code
preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we
hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal
solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore
superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal
solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive
Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively
amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages
exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive
experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our
theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or
surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies. Our work provides
both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate
training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates how unclear task descriptions affect code generation by LLMs, revealing significant performance drops due to minor flaws and contradictions. Larger models are more resilient but not immune.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness of LLMs in real-world scenarios where task descriptions are often ambiguous or flawed.

Method: Extended HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks with flawed task descriptions via guided mutations, evaluating multiple LLMs for correctness and failure modes.

Result: Minor task description flaws cause performance drops; contradictory descriptions lead to logical errors. Larger models are more resilient but still affected.

Conclusion: LLMs need robustness to handle imperfect task descriptions, requiring better training, evaluation benchmarks, and deployment strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code
generation tasks under idealized conditions, where task descriptions are clear
and precise. However, in practice, task descriptions frequently exhibit
ambiguity, incompleteness, or internal contradictions. In this paper, we
present the first empirical study examining the robustness of state-of-the-art
code generation models when faced with such unclear task descriptions. We
extend the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks by systematically introducing
realistic task descriptions flaws through guided mutation strategies, producing
a dataset that mirrors the messiness of informal developer instructions. We
evaluate multiple LLMs of varying sizes and architectures, analyzing their
functional correctness and failure modes across task descriptions categories.
Our findings reveal that even minor imperfections in task description phrasing
can cause significant performance degradation, with contradictory task
descriptions resulting in numerous logical errors. Moreover, while larger
models tend to be more resilient than smaller variants, they are not immune to
the challenges posed by unclear requirements. We further analyze semantic error
patterns and identify correlations between description clarity, model behavior,
and error types. Our results underscore the critical need for developing LLMs
that are not only powerful but also robust to the imperfections inherent in
natural user tasks, highlighting important considerations for improving model
training strategies, designing more realistic evaluation benchmarks, and
ensuring reliable deployment in practical software development environments.

*Maria Camporese,Fabio Massacci*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether LLMs in Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) rely on memorized fixes by testing their performance under controlled conditions with shifted fault locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs' success in AVR is due to hidden factors like training-data leakage or perfect fault localization, rather than genuine repair capabilities.

Method: The study shifts fault locations in prompts, uses two LLMs (one for patching, one for review), and validates patches with regression and vulnerability tests. Manual audits and statistical methods estimate error rates.

Result: The results aim to reveal whether LLMs reproduce memorized fixes or genuinely repair vulnerabilities when fault locations are altered.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the reliability of LLMs in AVR and whether their performance is artificially inflated by hidden factors.

Abstract: Background: Automated Vulnerability Repair (AVR) is a fast-growing branch of
program repair. Recent studies show that large language models (LLMs)
outperform traditional techniques, extending their success beyond code
generation and fault detection.
  Hypothesis: These gains may be driven by hidden factors -- "invisible hands"
such as training-data leakage or perfect fault localization -- that let an LLM
reproduce human-authored fixes for the same code.
  Objective: We replicate prior AVR studies under controlled conditions by
deliberately adding errors to the reported vulnerability location in the
prompt. If LLMs merely regurgitate memorized fixes, both small and large
localization errors should yield the same number of correct patches, because
any offset should divert the model from the original fix.
  Method: Our pipeline repairs vulnerabilities from the Vul4J and VJTrans
benchmarks after shifting the fault location by n lines from the ground truth.
A first LLM generates a patch, a second LLM reviews it, and we validate the
result with regression and proof-of-vulnerability tests. Finally, we manually
audit a sample of patches and estimate the error rate with the
Agresti-Coull-Wilson method.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework predicts 3D microphysical properties of ice crystals from 2D imagery with high accuracy, improving with stereo views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding ice crystal properties is crucial for climate studies, but direct measurement is challenging. This work aims to predict these properties from 2D imagery.

Method: Synthetic ice crystals are generated using 3D modeling and geometric parameters from a field campaign. ML models are trained to predict properties like density, surface area, and bullet count from imagery.

Result: ML models achieved high accuracy (R² up to 0.99) for density and surface area, and 0.91 F1 score for bullet count. Stereo views further improved predictions.

Conclusion: The framework enables accurate estimation of ice crystal properties from 2D imagery, aiding climate modeling and microphysical parameterizations.

Abstract: The microphysical properties of ice crystals are important because they
significantly alter the radiative properties and spatiotemporal distributions
of clouds, which in turn strongly affect Earth's climate. However, it is
challenging to measure key properties of ice crystals, such as mass or
morphological features. Here, we present a framework for predicting
three-dimensional (3D) microphysical properties of ice crystals from in situ
two-dimensional (2D) imagery. First, we computationally generate synthetic ice
crystals using 3D modeling software along with geometric parameters estimated
from the 2021 Ice Cryo-Encapsulation Balloon (ICEBall) field campaign. Then, we
use synthetic crystals to train machine learning (ML) models to predict
effective density ($\rho_{e}$), effective surface area ($A_e$), and number of
bullets ($N_b$) from synthetic rosette imagery. When tested on unseen synthetic
images, we find that our ML models can predict microphysical properties with
high accuracy. For $\rho_{e}$ and $A_e$, respectively, our best-performing
single view models achieved $R^2$ values of 0.99 and 0.98. For $N_b$, our best
single view model achieved a balanced accuracy and F1 score of 0.91. We also
quantify the marginal prediction improvements from incorporating a second view.
A stereo view ResNet-18 model reduced RMSE by 40% for both $\rho_e$ and $A_e$,
relative to a single view ResNet-18 model. For $N_b$, we find that a stereo
view ResNet-18 model improved the F1 score by 8%. This work provides a novel
ML-driven framework for estimating ice microphysical properties from in situ
imagery, which will allow for downstream constraints on microphysical
parameterizations, such as the mass-size relationship.

### [513] [A note on the Artstein-Avidan-Milman's generalized Legendre transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20577)
*Frank Nielsen*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: Generalized Legendre transforms correspond to ordinary Legendre transforms of affine-deformed functions, with implications for information geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the understanding of invertible reverse-ordering transforms on convex functions by linking generalized Legendre transforms to affine deformations.

Method: Proving that generalized Legendre transforms on functions are equivalent to ordinary Legendre transforms of affine-deformed functions.

Result: Generalized convex conjugates are shown to be convex conjugates of affine-deformed functions.

Conclusion: The findings connect generalized transforms to affine deformations and suggest applications in information geometry.

Abstract: Artstein-Avidan and Milman [Annals of mathematics (2009), (169):661-674]
characterized invertible reverse-ordering transforms on the space of
lower-semi-continuous extended real-valued convex functions as affine
deformations of the ordinary Legendre transform. In this note, we prove that
all those generalized Legendre transforms on functions correspond to the
ordinary Legendre transform on dually corresponding affine-deformed functions.
That is, generalized convex conjugates are convex conjugates of affine-deformed
functions. We conclude this note by sketching how this result can be
interpreted from the lens of information geometry.

### [514] [Handoff Design in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks Using DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20966)
*Hussein A. Ammar,Raviraj Adve,Shahram Shahbazpanahi,Gary Boudreau,Israfil Bahceci*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A DRL-based solution using Soft Actor-Critic predicts and manages handoffs in UC-mMIMO networks, balancing user rate and overhead with novel reward functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User mobility in UC-mMIMO networks causes frequent handoffs, leading to resource overheads. A scalable, real-time solution is needed.

Method: Uses Soft Actor-Critic with continuous action space and novel reward functions (HO penalty). Two variants: DA (direction-assisted) and HA (history-assisted).

Result: DRL approach outperforms discrete space methods, learns to cluster HOs, and operates in real-time (<0.4 ms response).

Conclusion: The DRL-based solution effectively manages HOs, minimizing overhead while maintaining performance, and is scalable for real-time use.

Abstract: In the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO (UC-mMIMO) network scheme, user
mobility necessitates updating the set of serving access points to maintain the
user-centric clustering. Such updates are typically performed through handoff
(HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the
allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for
mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with
continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve
as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that
integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the
associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the
first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on
the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA)
observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF).
Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is
more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy
automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the
overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a
response time less than 0.4 ms.

### [515] [The Architecture of Cognitive Amplification: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding as a Resolution to the Comfort-Growth Paradox in Human-AI Cognitive Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19483)
*Giuseppe Riva*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI systems risk fostering intellectual stagnation due to their user-friendly nature. The paper proposes Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to balance convenience and cognitive growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the 'comfort-growth paradox' where AI's ease of use may hinder cognitive development.

Method: Introduces a framework with Progressive Autonomy, Adaptive Personalization, and Cognitive Load Optimization, based on Vygotskian theories and AI ethics.

Result: Demonstrates improved skill acquisition, self-regulation, and higher-order thinking in various domains.

Conclusion: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding promotes cognitive growth while mitigating risks like dependency and bias.

Abstract: AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to
active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these
systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and
creativity - they present a fundamental "comfort-growth paradox": AI's
user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive
friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and
provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency
rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to
resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to
dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding
principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1)
Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence
increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual
needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing
mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity.
Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains
supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved
self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes
safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias
amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in
human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward
genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and
continuous learning.

TL;DR: The paper explores creativity in the UDHR to guide Computational Creativity (CC) systems, linking creativity as a Human Right and providing design considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align CC systems with the UDHR's view of creativity as a Human Right, emphasizing its evolving role in shared intelligence.

Method: Analysis of five UDHR articles, demonstrated with actualizations, leading to design considerations for CC systems.

Result: Established a relationship between creativity and CC systems, grounded in UDHR principles.

Conclusion: The study bridges creativity as a Human Right with CC system design, offering practical considerations for future development.

Abstract: We investigate creativity that is underlined in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) to present design considerations for Computational
Creativity (CC) systems. We find this declaration to describe creativity in
salient aspects and bring to light creativity as a Human Right attributed to
the Fourth Generation of such rights. This generation of rights attributes CC
systems and the evolving nature of interaction with entities of shared
intelligence. Our methodology examines five of thirty articles from the UDHR
and demonstrates each article with actualizations concluding with design
considerations for each. We contribute our findings to ground the relationship
between creativity and CC systems.

*Gabriel Recchia,Chatrik Singh Mangat,Jinu Nyachhyon,Mridul Sharma,Callum Canavan,Dylan Epstein-Gross,Muhammed Abdulbari*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Simple oversight protocols for AI evaluation show no clear advantage, with evaluator biases and model confidence affecting accuracy. Prior optimistic results may stem from human knowledge advantages, which diminish as models scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of scalable oversight protocols in verifying AI models more capable than human evaluators, given biases and systematic errors.

Method: Two studies tested simple oversight protocols where evaluators knew the model was mostly correct. Study 1 examined argument presentation, while Study 2 explored confidence after online research. Prior data was reanalyzed.

Result: No overall advantage for tested protocols. Argument presentation improved accuracy for incorrect model answers (Study 1). Confidence increased post-research, even for incorrect answers (Study 2). Prior optimistic results may not scale with model capability.

Conclusion: Oversight protocols must address evaluator biases, outperform simple deference, and scale with problem difficulty and model capability.

Abstract: Scalable oversight protocols aim to empower evaluators to accurately verify
AI models more capable than themselves. However, human evaluators are subject
to biases that can lead to systematic errors. We conduct two studies examining
the performance of simple oversight protocols where evaluators know that the
model is "correct most of the time, but not all of the time". We find no
overall advantage for the tested protocols, although in Study 1, showing
arguments in favor of both answers improves accuracy in cases where the model
is incorrect. In Study 2, participants in both groups become more confident in
the system's answers after conducting online research, even when those answers
are incorrect. We also reanalyze data from prior work that was more optimistic
about simple protocols, finding that human evaluators possessing knowledge
absent from models likely contributed to their positive results--an advantage
that diminishes as models continue to scale in capability. These findings
underscore the importance of testing the degree to which oversight protocols
are robust to evaluator biases, whether they outperform simple deference to the
model under evaluation, and whether their performance scales with increasing
problem difficulty and model capability.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartGen, an automated pipeline for generating synthetic chart-image-code pairs to evaluate chart-to-code reconstruction, addressing a gap in multimodal benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on chart summarization or Q&A, lacking tasks for grounding visualizations in machine-readable code. ChartGen aims to bridge this gap.

Method: ChartGen uses a vision-language model (VLM) to reconstruct seed chart images into Python scripts, then iteratively refines them with a code-oriented LLM. It generates 222.5K unique pairs from 13K seeds.

Result: The dataset includes 27 chart types, 11 libraries, and multiple data modalities. Evaluation of six VLMs (3B-26B) shows significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: ChartGen provides a valuable resource for advancing chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation, with released pipeline, prompts, and dataset.

Abstract: Chart-to-code reconstruction -- the task of recovering executable plotting
scripts from chart images -- provides important insights into a model's ability
to ground data visualizations in precise, machine-readable form. Yet many
existing multimodal benchmarks largely focus primarily on answering questions
about charts or summarizing them. To bridge this gap, we present ChartGen, a
fully-automated pipeline for code-guided synthetic chart generation. Starting
from seed chart images, ChartGen (i) prompts a vision-language model (VLM) to
reconstruct each image into a python script, and (ii) iteratively augments that
script with a code-oriented large language model (LLM). Using ChartGen, we
create 222.5K unique chart-image code pairs from 13K seed chart images, and
present an open-source synthetic chart dataset covering 27 chart types, 11
plotting libraries, and multiple data modalities (image, code, text, CSV,
DocTags). From this corpus, we curate a held-out chart-to-code evaluation
subset of 4.3K chart image-code pairs, and evaluate six open-weight VLMs (3B -
26B parameters), highlighting substantial room for progress. We release the
pipeline, prompts, and the dataset to help accelerate efforts towards robust
chart understanding and vision-conditioned code generation:

*Qing Dong,Pengyuan Liu,Dong Yu,Chen Kang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The PSYA framework enhances generative agents by modeling emotions, thoughts, and actions more authentically, improving human behavior simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks oversimplify emotional modeling, limiting the authenticity of human behavior simulations.

Method: The PSYA framework integrates three modules: Feeling (affect layers), Thought (Triple Network Model), and Action (emotion-need-plan optimization).

Result: PSYA produces more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, replicating human experimental outcomes.

Conclusion: PSYA offers a richer, more accurate approach for generative agents and an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

Abstract: Generative agents have made significant progress in simulating human
behavior, but existing frameworks often simplify emotional modeling and focus
primarily on specific tasks, limiting the authenticity of the simulation. Our
work proposes the Psychological-mechanism Agent (PSYA) framework, based on the
Cognitive Triangle (Feeling-Thought-Action), designed to more accurately
simulate human behavior. The PSYA consists of three core modules: the Feeling
module (using a layer model of affect to simulate changes in short-term,
medium-term, and long-term emotions), the Thought module (based on the Triple
Network Model to support goal-directed and spontaneous thinking), and the
Action module (optimizing agent behavior through the integration of emotions,
needs and plans). To evaluate the framework's effectiveness, we conducted daily
life simulations and extended the evaluation metrics to self-influence,
one-influence, and group-influence, selection five classic psychological
experiments for simulation. The results show that the PSYA framework generates
more natural, consistent, diverse, and credible behaviors, successfully
replicating human experimental outcomes. Our work provides a richer and more
accurate emotional and cognitive modeling approach for generative agents and
offers an alternative to human participants in psychological experiments.

*Alex Leitch,Celia Chen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper critiques current HCI research on AI art for focusing on detection and automation, arguing it misses how artistic value arises from human creative struggle. It proposes documenting stylistic lineage in AI-generated art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HCI research on AI art misunderstands artistic value by focusing on detection and automation, ignoring the human creative process.

Method: Examines historical precedents to show artistic style stems from creative struggle, not just visual appearance. Proposes documenting stylistic lineage in AI art.

Result: AI systems currently flatten human choices into patterns without preserving their origins.

Conclusion: HCI should shift focus to documenting stylistic lineage and creative choices in AI-generated art, not just perfecting output.

Abstract: As AI art generation becomes increasingly sophisticated, HCI research has
focused primarily on questions of detection, authenticity, and automation. This
paper argues that such approaches fundamentally misunderstand how artistic
value emerges from the concerns that drive human image production. Through
examination of historical precedents, we demonstrate that artistic style is not
only visual appearance but the resolution of creative struggle, as artists
wrestle with influence and technical constraints to develop unique ways of
seeing. Current AI systems flatten these human choices into reproducible
patterns without preserving their provenance. We propose that HCI's role lies
not only in perfecting visual output, but in developing means to document the
origins and evolution of artistic style as it appears within generated visual
traces. This reframing suggests new technical directions for HCI research in
generative AI, focused on automatic documentation of stylistic lineage and
creative choice rather than simple reproduction of aesthetic effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of LLMs in healthcare, such as interpretability and multi-task integration, for domain-specific needs like myopia, and demonstrate real-world effectiveness as patient education tools.

Method: Develop ChatMyopia, integrating an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge base from literature, expert consensus, and guidelines. Validate through myopic maculopathy grading, single-question exams, and human evaluations.

Result: ChatMyopia delivered personalized, accurate, and safe responses, significantly improving patient satisfaction in a randomized trial (n=70) compared to traditional leaflets.

Conclusion: ChatMyopia is a valuable supplement for patient education in primary eye care, enhancing satisfaction and communication.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for tailored healthcare
communication but face challenges in interpretability and multi-task
integration particularly for domain-specific needs like myopia, and their
real-world effectiveness as patient education tools has yet to be demonstrated.
Here, we introduce ChatMyopia, an LLM-based AI agent designed to address text
and image-based inquiries related to myopia. To achieve this, ChatMyopia
integrates an image classification tool and a retrieval-augmented knowledge
base built from literature, expert consensus, and clinical guidelines. Myopic
maculopathy grading task, single question examination and human evaluations
validated its ability to deliver personalized, accurate, and safe responses to
myopia-related inquiries with high scalability and interpretability. In a
randomized controlled trial (n=70, NCT06607822), ChatMyopia significantly
improved patient satisfaction compared to traditional leaflets, enhancing
patient education in accuracy, empathy, disease awareness, and patient-eyecare
practitioner communication. These findings highlight ChatMyopia's potential as
a valuable supplement to enhance patient education and improve satisfaction
with medical services in primary eye care settings.

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI can foster psychological spaciousness in society by quantifying subconscious self-expression modifications due to cultural norms, using gaze analysis and a new metric (GPI-Diff).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how marginalized groups subconsciously alter authenticity due to dominant cultural norms and how AI can promote inclusivity.

Method: Analyzes gaze effects via Reddit posts, introduces GPI-Diff metric, and formulates an equation for LLM training.

Result: Develops a mathematical model for AI training and advocates for inclusive HCI based on neuroplasticity principles.

Conclusion: AI can enhance societal harmony by fostering authenticity and inclusivity through tailored LLM training.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence provides an opportunity to
create psychological spaciousness in society. Spaciousness is defined as the
ability to hold diverse interpersonal interactions and forms the basis for
vulnerability that leads to authenticity that leads to prosocial behaviors and
thus to societal harmony. This paper demonstrates an attempt to quantify, the
human conditioning to subconsciously modify authentic self-expression to fit
the norms of the dominant culture. Gaze is explored across various marginalized
and intersectional groups, using concepts from postmodern philosophy and
psychology. The effects of gaze are studied through analyzing a few redacted
Reddit posts, only to be discussed in discourse and not endorsement. A
mathematical formulation for the Gaze Pressure Index (GPI)-Diff Composite
Metric is presented to model the analysis of two sets of conversational spaces
in relation to one another. The outcome includes an equation to train Large
Language Models (LLMs) - the working mechanism of AI products such as Chat-GPT;
and an argument for affirming and inclusive HCI, based on the equation, is
presented. The argument is supported by a few principles of Neuro-plasticity,
The brain's lifelong capacity to rewire.

TL;DR: TS-Insight is a visual analytics tool designed to make Thompson Sampling algorithms more interpretable and debuggable by visualizing their internal decision mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson Sampling algorithms are often opaque, making debugging and trust difficult, especially in sensitive domains.

Method: TS-Insight uses multiple plots to track evolving posteriors, evidence counts, and sampling outcomes for each arm.

Result: The tool enables verification, diagnosis, and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics.

Conclusion: TS-Insight fosters trust and facilitates effective debugging and deployment in complex, sensitive decision-making scenarios.

Abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) and its variants are powerful Multi-Armed Bandit
algorithms used to balance exploration and exploitation strategies in active
learning. Yet, their probabilistic nature often turns them into a ``black
box'', hindering debugging and trust. We introduce TS-Insight, a visual
analytics tool explicitly designed to shed light on the internal decision
mechanisms of Thompson Sampling-based algorithms, for model developers. It
comprises multiple plots, tracing for each arm the evolving posteriors,
evidence counts, and sampling outcomes, enabling the verification, diagnosis,
and explainability of exploration/exploitation dynamics. This tool aims at
fostering trust and facilitating effective debugging and deployment in complex
binary decision-making scenarios especially in sensitive domains requiring

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The RISEE dataset integrates human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data with naturalistic driving trajectories to address gaps in existing datasets for autonomous driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack human-related information and safety-critical scenarios, while simulated datasets lack authenticity.

Method: Combines drone-based (realism) and simulation-based (safety) methods to collect data, including subjective evaluations and eye-tracking.

Result: 3567 valid risk ratings and 2045 eye-tracking segments from 101 participants across 179 scenarios.

Conclusion: The RISEE dataset fills critical gaps by incorporating human factors, enhancing autonomous driving system evaluation.

Abstract: In the research and development (R&D) and verification and validation (V&V)
phases of autonomous driving decision-making and planning systems, it is
necessary to integrate human factors to achieve decision-making and evaluation
that align with human cognition. However, most existing datasets primarily
focus on vehicle motion states and trajectories, neglecting human-related
information. In addition, current naturalistic driving datasets lack sufficient
safety-critical scenarios while simulated datasets suffer from low
authenticity. To address these issues, this paper constructs the Risk-Informed
Subjective Evaluation and Eye-tracking (RISEE) dataset which specifically
contains human subjective evaluations and eye-tracking data apart from regular
naturalistic driving trajectories. By leveraging the complementary advantages
of drone-based (high realism and extensive scenario coverage) and
simulation-based (high safety and reproducibility) data collection methods, we
first conduct drone-based traffic video recording at a highway ramp merging
area. After that, the manually selected highly interactive scenarios are
reconstructed in simulation software, and drivers' first-person view (FPV)
videos are generated, which are then viewed and evaluated by recruited
participants. During the video viewing process, participants' eye-tracking data
is collected. After data processing and filtering, 3567 valid subjective risk
ratings from 101 participants across 179 scenarios are retained, along with
2045 qualified eye-tracking data segments. The collected data and examples of
the generated FPV videos are available in our website.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces TULCA, a tensor decomposition method for flexible comparative analysis of tensors, integrating discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, with a visual analytics interface for interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor decomposition methods lack support for flexible comparative analysis, unlike dimensionality reduction methods for matrices.

Method: Extends ULCA to tensor analysis, integrating discriminant analysis and contrastive learning for decomposition, and includes a visualization method for core tensors.

Result: TULCA enables flexible tensor comparison and is demonstrated effective through computational evaluations and case studies, including supercomputer log data analysis.

Conclusion: TULCA addresses the limitation of existing methods by supporting comparative tensor analysis and visualization, validated by practical applications.

Abstract: Comparing tensors and identifying their (dis)similar structures is
fundamental in understanding the underlying phenomena for complex data. Tensor
decomposition methods help analysts extract tensors' essential characteristics
and aid in visual analytics for tensors. In contrast to dimensionality
reduction (DR) methods designed only for analyzing a matrix (i.e., second-order
tensor), existing tensor decomposition methods do not support flexible
comparative analysis. To address this analysis limitation, we introduce a new
tensor decomposition method, named tensor unified linear comparative analysis
(TULCA), by extending its DR counterpart, ULCA, for tensor analysis. TULCA
integrates discriminant analysis and contrastive learning schemes for tensor
decomposition, enabling flexible comparison of tensors. We also introduce an
effective method to visualize a core tensor extracted from TULCA into a set of
2D visualizations. We integrate TULCA's functionalities into a visual analytics
interface to support analysts in interpreting and refining the TULCA results.
We demonstrate the efficacy of TULCA and the visual analytics interface with
computational evaluations and two case studies, including an analysis of log
data collected from a supercomputer.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how practitioners favor visually appealing dimensionality reduction projections over structurally faithful ones, identifies this bias as 'visual interestingness,' and suggests mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why practitioners prefer aesthetically pleasing projections over structurally accurate ones and how this bias affects analysis.

Method: Conducted a user study to verify the bias's existence and explain its causes, focusing on factors like color-encoded labels and exposure time.

Result: Found that visual interestingness biases projection selection, especially with color labels and shorter viewing times.

Conclusion: Proposes strategies to reduce bias in interpreting dimensionality reduction projections for more reliable analysis.

Abstract: Selecting the dimensionality reduction technique that faithfully represents
the structure is essential for reliable visual communication and analytics. In
reality, however, practitioners favor projections for other attractions, such
as aesthetics and visual saliency, over the projection's structural
faithfulness, a bias we define as visual interestingness. In this research, we
conduct a user study that (1) verifies the existence of such bias and (2)
explains why the bias exists. Our study suggests that visual interestingness
biases practitioners' preferences when selecting projections for analysis, and
this bias intensifies with color-encoded labels and shorter exposure time.
Based on our findings, we discuss strategies to mitigate bias in perceiving and
interpreting DR projections.

*Sinnyum Choi,Woong Kim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study proposes replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec framework to improve LLM-based recommendation systems, achieving significant performance gains without structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in LLMs have not been fully utilized in recommendation systems, prompting the need for cost-effective improvements.

Method: Llama2 was replaced with Llama3 in the LlamaRec framework, with identical input data and random seed values for fair comparison.

Result: Performance improved by 38.65%, 8.69%, and 8.19% on ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed model replacement is a practical and cost-effective way to enhance recommendation system performance.

Abstract: Recently, competition in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has
intensified among major technological companies, resulting in the continuous
release of new large-language models (LLMs) that exhibit improved language
understanding and context-based reasoning capabilities. It is expected that
these advances will enable more efficient personalized recommendations in
LLM-based recommendation systems through improved quality of training data and
architectural design. However, many studies have not considered these recent
developments. In this study, it was proposed to improve LLM-based
recommendation systems by replacing Llama2 with Llama3 in the LlamaRec
framework. To ensure a fair comparison, random seed values were set and
identical input data was provided during preprocessing and training. The
experimental results show average performance improvements of 38.65\%, 8.69\%,
and 8.19\% for the ML-100K, Beauty, and Games datasets, respectively, thus
confirming the practicality of this method. Notably, the significant
improvements achieved by model replacement indicate that the recommendation
quality can be improved cost-effectively without the need to make structural
changes to the system. Based on these results, it is our contention that the
proposed approach is a viable solution for improving the performance of current
recommendation systems.

Motivation: Current trip recommendation models struggle with undesired repetitive outcomes, which AR-Trip aims to resolve.

Method: AR-Trip incorporates a cycle-aware predictor with three mechanisms to avoid duplicate POIs, using perturbations during training and decoding.

consistency, they struggle with undesired repetitive outcomes that need
resolution. We make two pivotal discoveries using statistical analyses and
experimental designs: (1) The occurrence of repetitions is intricately linked
to the models and decoding strategies. (2) During training and decoding, adding
perturbations to logits can reduce repetition. Motivated by these observations,
we introduce AR-Trip (Anti Repetition for Trip Recommendation), which
incorporates a cycle-aware predictor comprising three mechanisms to avoid
duplicate Points-of-Interest (POIs) and demonstrates their effectiveness in
alleviating repetition. Experiments on four public datasets illustrate that
AR-Trip successfully mitigates repetition issues while enhancing precision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting rare conversion events (<1%) in online advertising, which are difficult to model accurately due to their scarcity.

Method: The model classifies conversions into rare or frequent types, learns shared representations across all signals, and uses separate task towers for each type.

Result: The approach achieved a 0.69% AUC lift offline and a 2% reduction in Cost per Action online.

Conclusion: The MTL approach effectively improves prediction accuracy for rare conversion events and enhances online advertising performance metrics.

Abstract: We present a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) approach for improving predictions for
rare (e.g., <1%) conversion events in online advertising. The conversions are
classified into "rare" or "frequent" types based on historical statistics. The
model learns shared representations across all signals while specializing
through separate task towers for each type. The approach was tested and fully
deployed to production, demonstrating consistent improvements in both offline

### [530] [Beyond Interactions: Node-Level Graph Generation for Knowledge-Free Augmentation in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20578)
*Zhaoyan Wang,Hyunjun Ahn,In-Young Ko*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: NodeDiffRec is a knowledge-free framework using diffusion for node-level graph generation in recommender systems, improving semantic diversity and structural connectivity without external resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recommender systems rely on external knowledge, limiting real-world applicability. Knowledge-free models lack augmentation primitives to bridge semantic and structural gaps.

Method: NodeDiffRec synthesizes pseudo-items and interactions via diffusion, refining user preferences through denoising.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance with up to 98.6% improvement in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5 over baselines.

Conclusion: NodeDiffRec effectively enhances recommendations without external knowledge, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in recommender systems rely on external resources such as
knowledge graphs or large language models to enhance recommendations, which
limit applicability in real-world settings due to data dependency and
computational overhead. Although knowledge-free models are able to bolster
recommendations by direct edge operations as well, the absence of augmentation
primitives drives them to fall short in bridging semantic and structural gaps
as high-quality paradigm substitutes. Unlike existing diffusion-based works
that remodel user-item interactions, this work proposes NodeDiffRec, a
pioneering knowledge-free augmentation framework that enables fine-grained
node-level graph generation for recommendations and expands the scope of
restricted augmentation primitives via diffusion. By synthesizing pseudo-items
and corresponding interactions that align with the underlying distribution for
injection, and further refining user preferences through a denoising preference
modeling process, NodeDiffRec dramatically enhances both semantic diversity and
structural connectivity without external knowledge. Extensive experiments
across diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the
superiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with
maximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5
over selected baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the debate on whether DNNs can outperform traditional tree-based models in Learning-to-Rank tasks for e-commerce.

Method: Systematic benchmarking of DNNs against a production-grade LambdaMART model, evaluating architectures and loss functions on proprietary data, followed by an 8-week A/B test.

Result: A simple DNN outperformed LambdaMART in clicks and revenue, achieving parity in units sold.

Conclusion: DNNs can surpass tree-based models in certain e-commerce ranking metrics, though trade-offs exist.

Abstract: In e-commerce recommender and search systems, tree-based models, such as
LambdaMART, have set a strong baseline for Learning-to-Rank (LTR) tasks.
Despite their effectiveness and widespread adoption in industry, the debate
continues whether deep neural networks (DNNs) can outperform traditional
tree-based models in this domain. To contribute to this discussion, we
systematically benchmark DNNs against our production-grade LambdaMART model. We
evaluate multiple DNN architectures and loss functions on a proprietary dataset
from OTTO and validate our findings through an 8-week online A/B test. The
results show that a simple DNN architecture outperforms a strong tree-based
baseline in terms of total clicks and revenue, while achieving parity in total
units sold.

*Faruk Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad,Bugra Kilictas,Taylan Alpay*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a continuum of agents, proving convergence of regret-based learning dynamics to a unique quantal response equilibrium. It unifies functional analysis, geometry, and game theory, and introduces the ordinal folding index to measure convergence time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for large-scale multi-agent systems and link game theory with functional analysis and geometry.

Method: Develops a von Neumann algebra framework for collective strategy evolution, uses a reflective regret operator, and introduces the ordinal folding index to measure dynamics.

Result: Proves convergence to a unique equilibrium, establishes new rigidity results, and links regret flows with empirical stability in large language models.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust foundation for continuum agent systems and demonstrates the utility of ordinal metrics in equilibrium selection.

Abstract: We develop an operator algebraic framework for infinite games with a
continuum of agents and prove that regret based learning dynamics governed by a
noncommutative continuity equation converge to a unique quantal response
equilibrium under mild regularity assumptions. The framework unifies functional
analysis, coarse geometry and game theory by assigning to every game a von
Neumann algebra that represents collective strategy evolution. A reflective
regret operator within this algebra drives the flow of strategy distributions
and its fixed point characterises equilibrium. We introduce the ordinal folding
index, a computable ordinal valued metric that measures the self referential
depth of the dynamics, and show that it bounds the transfinite time needed for
convergence, collapsing to zero on coarsely amenable networks. The theory
yields new invariant subalgebra rigidity results, establishes existence and
uniqueness of envy free and maximin share allocations in continuum economies,
and links analytic properties of regret flows with empirical stability
phenomena in large language models. These contributions supply a rigorous
mathematical foundation for large scale multi agent systems and demonstrate the
utility of ordinal metrics for equilibrium selection.

*Lechen Feng,Xun Li,Yuan-Hua Ni*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper addresses drawbacks of penalty approaches in solving distributed and sparse feedback LQ problems by reformulating them using epi-composition functions and analyzing ADMM convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges like penalty parameter tuning and spurious stationary points in penalty-based methods for LQ problems.

Method: Reformulates SF-LQ and DFT-LQ problems using epi-composition functions, analyzes ADMM convergence, and employs subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation when needed.

Result: Direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, avoiding convex surrogates or penalty formulations.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust solution for LQ problems without relying on restrictive assumptions or penalty methods.

Abstract: This work is a companion paper of [8], where the distributed linear-quadratic
problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the sparse feedback LQ
problem (SF-LQ) are formulated into a nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization
problem with affine constraints. Moreover, a penalty approach is considered in
\cite{feng-part1}, and the PALM (proximal alternating linearized minimization)
algorithm is studied with convergence and complexity analysis. In this paper,
we aim to address the inherent drawbacks of the penalty approach, such as the
challenge of tuning the penalty parameter and the risk of introducing spurious
stationary points. Specifically, we first reformulate the SF-LQ problem and the
DFT-LQ problem from an epi-composition function perspective, aiming to solve
the constrained problem directly. Then, from a theoretical viewpoint, we
revisit the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and establish
its convergence to the set of cluster points under certain assumptions. When
these assumptions do not hold, we can effectively utilize alternative
approaches combining subgradient descent with Difference-of-Convex relaxation
methods. In summary, our results enable the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates, restrictive structural assumptions, or penalty formulations that
incorporate constraints into the cost function.

*Yu-Jui Huang,Zachariah Malik*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a density-dependent temperature in Langevin diffusion for non-convex optimization, forming a mean-field SDE. It proves uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck solution, constructs a weak SDE solution, and shows convergence to an invariant distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve optimization in non-convex landscapes by adapting temperature based on the diffusion's density, leveraging local landscape features like minimizer depth.

Method: Uses a density-dependent temperature in Langevin diffusion, forming a mean-field SDE. Analyzes via Wasserstein subdifferential calculus and Trevisan's superposition principle.

Result: Proves uniqueness of the Fokker-Planck solution, constructs a weak SDE solution, and shows convergence to an explicit invariant distribution (Lambert W function).

Conclusion: The self-regulated Langevin dynamics offers a novel approach for non-convex optimization with theoretical guarantees on convergence and invariant distribution.

Abstract: In the context of non-convex optimization, we let the temperature of a
Langevin diffusion to depend on the diffusion's own density function. The
rationale is that the induced density reveals to some extent the landscape
imposed by the non-convex function to be minimized, such that a
density-dependent temperature can provide location-wise random perturbation
that may better react to, for instance, the location and depth of local
minimizers. As the Langevin dynamics is now self-regulated by its own density,
it forms a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the Nemytskii
type, distinct from the standard McKean-Vlasov equations. Relying on
Wasserstein subdifferential calculus, we first show that the corresponding
(nonlinear) Fokker-Planck equation has a unique solution. Next, a weak solution
to the SDE is constructed from the solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, by
Trevisan's superposition principle. As time goes to infinity, we further show
that the density induced by the SDE converges to an invariant distribution,
which admits an explicit formula in terms of the Lambert $W$ function.

*Yanhui Sun,Wu Liu,Wentao Wang,Hantao Yao,Jiebo Luo,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: DynamiX is a novel social network simulator for dynamic social network modeling, improving attitude evolution and collective behavior analysis by addressing dynamic social relationships and role switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies neglect dynamic social relationship evolution, creating a gap in accurately simulating real-world social behaviors.

Method: DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for core agent selection and distinct modeling strategies for opinion leaders (information-stream-based link prediction) and ordinary users (inequality-oriented behavior decision-making).

Result: DynamiX outperforms static networks in attitude evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis, also aiding follower growth prediction and opinion leader cultivation.

Conclusion: DynamiX advances social network simulation by capturing dynamic social relationships, offering practical insights for social stability and opinion leader strategies.

Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic mechanisms of social platforms is an urgent
demand to maintain social stability. The rise of large language models provides
significant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude
dynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly
focus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of
social relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel
large-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network
modeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents
with key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of
real-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct
dynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For
opinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method
recommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous
connections, and autonomous behavior decisions. For ordinary users, we
construct an inequality-oriented behavior decision-making module, effectively
addressing unequal social interactions and capturing the patterns of
relationship adjustments driven by multi-dimensional factors. Experimental
results demonstrate that DynamiX exhibits marked improvements in attitude
evolution simulation and collective behavior analysis compared to static
networks. Besides, DynamiX opens a new theoretical perspective on follower
growth prediction, providing empirical evidence for opinion leaders
cultivation.

TL;DR: The paper classifies urban forms in U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators and links them to mobility patterns, showing distinct associations between urban morphology and transportation choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comparative and formal classifications of urban form and its impact on human mobility.

Method: Used unsupervised learning to classify urban forms based on structural indicators (density, connectivity, spatial configuration) and linked these to mobility patterns via descriptive statistics, marginal effects estimation, and statistical testing.

Result: Distinct urban forms correlate with specific mobility behaviors, e.g., reticular forms increase public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduce car dependence (-0.41), while organic forms increase car usage (0.44) and decrease public transport (-0.47) and active mobility (-0.30). Effects are statistically robust (p < 1e-19).

Conclusion: Urban form significantly influences transportation choices, suggesting it should be a key variable in mobility planning and sustainable urban policy design.

Abstract: Urban morphology has long been recognized as a factor shaping human mobility,
yet comparative and formal classifications of urban form across metropolitan
areas remain limited. Building on theoretical principles of urban structure and
advances in unsupervised learning, we systematically classified the built
environment of nine U.S. metropolitan areas using structural indicators such as
density, connectivity, and spatial configuration. The resulting morphological
types were linked to mobility patterns through descriptive statistics, marginal
effects estimation, and post hoc statistical testing. Here we show that
distinct urban forms are systematically associated with different mobility
behaviors, such as reticular morphologies being linked to significantly higher
public transport use (marginal effect = 0.49) and reduced car dependence
(-0.41), while organic forms are associated with increased car usage (0.44),
and substantial declines in public transport (-0.47) and active mobility
(-0.30). These effects are statistically robust (p < 1e-19), highlighting that
the spatial configuration of urban areas plays a fundamental role in shaping
transportation choices. Our findings extend previous work by offering a
reproducible framework for classifying urban form and demonstrate the added
value of morphological analysis in comparative urban research. These results
suggest that urban form should be treated as a key variable in mobility
planning and provide empirical support for incorporating spatial typologies
into sustainable urban policy design.

TL;DR: A novel multi-condition guided V2M framework improves music generation by incorporating time-varying conditions and a two-stage training strategy for better control and alignment with user expectations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2M methods lack control and fail to meet user expectations due to black-box generation.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) fine-grained feature selection and temporal alignment, (2) dynamic conditional fusion and control-guided decoding.

Result: Outperforms existing V2M methods in subjective and objective evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances control and alignment in V2M generation, meeting user needs effectively.

Abstract: Music enhances video narratives and emotions, driving demand for automatic
video-to-music (V2M) generation. However, existing V2M methods relying solely
on visual features or supplementary textual inputs generate music in a
black-box manner, often failing to meet user expectations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel multi-condition guided V2M generation framework
that incorporates multiple time-varying conditions for enhanced control over
music generation. Our method uses a two-stage training strategy that enables
learning of V2M fundamentals and audiovisual temporal synchronization while
meeting users' needs for multi-condition control. In the first stage, we
introduce a fine-grained feature selection module and a progressive temporal
alignment attention mechanism to ensure flexible feature alignment. For the
second stage, we develop a dynamic conditional fusion module and a
control-guided decoder module to integrate multiple conditions and accurately
guide the music composition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing V2M pipelines in both subjective and objective
evaluations, significantly enhancing control and alignment with user
expectations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning in near-field XL-MIMO OFDM systems by leveraging deep learning.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: positioning stage predicts user coordinates, which enhance channel estimation. Uses CP-Mamba, a U-shaped Mamba architecture, to capture spatial features and temporal dependencies.

Result: Numerical simulations show the proposed method outperforms baselines, with sparse arrays significantly improving accuracy over compact arrays.

Conclusion: The CP-Mamba framework effectively integrates positioning and channel estimation, demonstrating superior performance, especially with sparse arrays.

Abstract: This paper investigates joint channel estimation and positioning in
near-field sparse extra-large multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO)
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To achieve
cooperative gains between channel estimation and positioning, we propose a deep
learning-based two-stage framework comprising positioning and channel
estimation. In the positioning stage, the user's coordinates are predicted and
utilized in the channel estimation stage, thereby enhancing the accuracy of
channel estimation. Within this framework, we propose a U-shaped Mamba
architecture for channel estimation and positioning, termed as CP-Mamba. This
network integrates the strengths of the Mamba model with the structural
advantages of U-shaped convolutional networks, enabling effective capture of
local spatial features and long-range temporal dependencies of the channel.
Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage approach
with CP-Mamba architecture outperforms existing baseline methods. Moreover,
sparse arrays (SA) exhibit significantly superior performance in both channel
estimation and positioning accuracy compared to conventional compact arrays.

TL;DR: NeuroCLIP, a deep learning framework integrating EEG and fNIRS data, improves biomarker reliability for methamphetamine addiction and rTMS treatment evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective self-reports for methamphetamine dependence and rTMS treatment assessment are unreliable. Existing neuroimaging methods (EEG, fNIRS) have limitations due to conventional feature extraction.

Method: Proposed NeuroCLIP integrates EEG and fNIRS data using progressive learning for robust biomarker extraction.

Result: NeuroCLIP outperforms single-modality models in discriminating addiction and tracks rTMS treatment efficacy via neural pattern shifts. Biomarker correlates with craving scores.

Conclusion: NeuroCLIP enhances biomarker reliability for addiction research and clinical assessments, surpassing single-modality approaches.

Abstract: Methamphetamine dependence poses a significant global health challenge, yet
its assessment and the evaluation of treatments like repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) frequently depend on subjective self-reports, which
may introduce uncertainties. While objective neuroimaging modalities such as
electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
offer alternatives, their individual limitations and the reliance on
conventional, often hand-crafted, feature extraction can compromise the
reliability of derived biomarkers. To overcome these limitations, we propose
NeuroCLIP, a novel deep learning framework integrating simultaneously recorded
EEG and fNIRS data through a progressive learning strategy. This approach
offers a robust and trustworthy biomarker for methamphetamine addiction.
Validation experiments show that NeuroCLIP significantly improves
discriminative capabilities among the methamphetamine-dependent individuals and
healthy controls compared to models using either EEG or only fNIRS alone.
Furthermore, the proposed framework facilitates objective, brain-based
evaluation of rTMS treatment efficacy, demonstrating measurable shifts in
neural patterns towards healthy control profiles after treatment. Critically,
we establish the trustworthiness of the multimodal data-driven biomarker by
showing its strong correlation with psychometrically validated craving scores.
These findings suggest that biomarker derived from EEG-fNIRS data via NeuroCLIP
offers enhanced robustness and reliability over single-modality approaches,
providing a valuable tool for addiction neuroscience research and potentially
improving clinical assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance depth reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation in iToF systems without hardware modifications or complex data-driven methods.

Method: Uses a single modulation frequency, constructs a sensing matrix with multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle waves, accounts for lens distortion, and applies K-Means clustering for sparse recovery.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and robustness, requiring no hardware changes.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical and efficient solution for improving iToF system performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel compressed sensing method to improve the depth
reconstruction accuracy and multi-target separation capability of indirect
Time-of-Flight (iToF) systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on
hardware modifications, complex modulation, or cumbersome data-driven
reconstruction, our method operates with a single modulation frequency and
constructs the sensing matrix using multiple phase shifts and narrow-duty-cycle
continuous waves. During matrix construction, we further account for pixel-wise
range variation caused by lens distortion, making the sensing matrix better
aligned with actual modulation response characteristics. To enhance sparse
recovery, we apply K-Means clustering to the distance response dictionary and
constrain atom selection within each cluster during the OMP process, which
effectively reduces the search space and improves solution stability.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
traditional approaches in both reconstruction accuracy and robustness, without
requiring any additional hardware changes.

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN-Transformer framework is proposed for pediatric respiratory sound classification, outperforming previous models by 3.81-5.94%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of automated lung sound analysis for children under 6, whose lung acoustics differ from adults.

Method: Multistage hybrid CNN-Transformer framework combining CNN features with attention-based architecture, using scalogram images from recordings and breath events.

Result: Achieved scores of 0.9039 (binary) and 0.8448 (multiclass) for event classification, and 0.720 (ternary) and 0.571 (multiclass) for recording-level classification.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for pediatric respiratory disease diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring
respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled
healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely
studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in
children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental
changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of
respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches
tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid
CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an
attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using
scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our
model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and
0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to
address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of
0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores
outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This
approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease
diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a behavioral scoring framework for Uniswap users, with two scores: Liquidity Provision Score and Swap Behavior Score, using rule-based blueprints and a deep neural network for context-aware risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve risk modeling and on-chain reputation in DeFi by distinguishing between liquidity provision and active trading behaviors.

Method: A rule-based blueprint decomposes behaviors into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal patterns, enhanced by a deep residual neural network with U-Net-inspired skip blocks. Pool-level context (TVL, fee tiers, etc.) is incorporated.

Result: The framework effectively segments users and supports protocol-aligned reputation systems, as demonstrated on Uniswap v3 data.

Conclusion: The proposed zScore framework enables scalable, context-aware DeFi user scoring, enhancing risk assessment and incentive design for Uniswap.

Abstract: As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, distinguishing between user
behaviors - liquidity provision versus active trading - has become vital for
risk modeling and on-chain reputation. We propose a behavioral scoring
framework for Uniswap that assigns two complementary scores: a Liquidity
Provision Score that assesses strategic liquidity contributions, and a Swap
Behavior Score that reflects trading intent, volatility exposure, and
discipline. The scores are constructed using rule-based blueprints that
decompose behavior into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal
patterns. To handle edge cases and learn feature interactions, we introduce a
deep residual neural network with densely connected skip blocks inspired by the
U-Net architecture. We also incorporate pool-level context such as total value
locked (TVL), fee tiers, and pool size, allowing the system to differentiate
similar user behaviors across pools with varying characteristics. Our framework
enables context-aware and scalable DeFi user scoring, supporting improved risk
assessment and incentive design. Experiments on Uniswap v3 data show its
usefulness for user segmentation and protocol-aligned reputation systems.
Although we refer to our metric as zScore, it is independently developed and
methodologically different from the cross-protocol system proposed by Udupi et
al. Our focus is on role-specific behavioral modeling within Uniswap using
blueprint logic and supervised learning.

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of classifying benign vs malignant lung nodules in CT images with improved accuracy and generalization.

Method: Uses three pretrained backbones with custom classification heads, a two-stage attention mechanism, dynamic focal loss, MixUp augmentation, and test-time augmentation.

Result: Achieves 98.09% accuracy, 0.9961 AUC, and balanced sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96).

Conclusion: The model is a robust automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening, especially in challenging cases.

Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones --
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 -- are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a

*Qinlong Li,Pu Sun,Guanlin Zhu,Tianjiao Liang,Honggang QI*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A machine learning model was developed to predict postoperative recurrence risk in colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) patients, focusing on preoperative data to avoid data leakage. The 3-month prediction model showed strong clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current clinical models for CRLM prognosis lack accuracy, necessitating a more reliable predictive tool.

Method: Used preoperative clinical and radiomic features from CT imaging to predict recurrence at 3, 6, and 12 months, avoiding postoperative data to prevent leakage.

Result: The 3-month model achieved an AUC of 0.723, outperforming traditional strategies in decision curve analysis.

Conclusion: The study provides a clinically useful predictive model while addressing data leakage risks, enhancing reliability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Prognostic evaluation in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM)
remains challenging due to suboptimal accuracy of conventional clinical models.
This study developed and validated a robust machine learning model for
predicting postoperative recurrence risk. Preliminary ensemble models achieved
exceptionally high performance (AUC $>$ 0.98) but incorporated postoperative
features, introducing data leakage risks. To enhance clinical applicability, we
restricted input variables to preoperative baseline clinical parameters and
radiomic features from contrast-enhanced CT imaging, specifically targeting
recurrence prediction at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The 3-month
recurrence prediction model demonstrated optimal performance with an AUC of
0.723 in cross-validation. Decision curve analysis revealed that across
threshold probabilities of 0.55-0.95, the model consistently provided greater
net benefit than "treat-all" or "treat-none" strategies, supporting its utility
in postoperative surveillance and therapeutic decision-making. This study
successfully developed a robust predictive model for early CRLM recurrence with
confirmed clinical utility. Importantly, it highlights the critical risk of
data leakage in clinical prognostic modeling and proposes a rigorous framework
to mitigate this issue, enhancing model reliability and translational value in
real-world settings.

*Daniel La'ah Ayuba,Jean-Yves Guillemaut,Belen Marti-Cardona,Oscar Mendez Maldonado*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes SpecBPP, a self-supervised learning method for hyperspectral imagery (HSI) by predicting shuffled spectral band orders, achieving state-of-the-art results in SOC estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning is underexplored for HSI despite its potential due to spectral band structure.

Method: Uses Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP) with curriculum-based training to manage permutation complexity.

Result: Achieves R² of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19, outperforming MAE and JEPA baselines.

Conclusion: Spectral order prediction is effective for HSI understanding, advancing remote sensing representation learning.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning in vision
and language, but remains underexplored for hyperspectral imagery (HSI), where
the sequential structure of spectral bands offers unique opportunities. In this
work, we propose Spectral Band Permutation Prediction (SpecBPP), a novel
self-supervised learning framework that leverages the inherent spectral
continuity in HSI. Instead of reconstructing masked bands, SpecBPP challenges a
model to recover the correct order of shuffled spectral segments, encouraging
global spectral understanding. We implement a curriculum-based training
strategy that progressively increases permutation difficulty to manage the
factorial complexity of the permutation space. Applied to Soil Organic Carbon
(SOC) estimation using EnMAP satellite data, our method achieves
state-of-the-art results, outperforming both masked autoencoder (MAE) and
joint-embedding predictive (JEPA) baselines. Fine-tuned on limited labeled
samples, our model yields an $R^2$ of 0.9456, RMSE of 1.1053%, and RPD of 4.19,
significantly surpassing traditional and self-supervised benchmarks. Our
results demonstrate that spectral order prediction is a powerful pretext task
for hyperspectral understanding, opening new avenues for scientific
representation learning in remote sensing and beyond.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated breast cancer classification is challenging due to subtle differences between benign and malignant tissue in mammography.

Method: A hybrid approach fusing deep ResNet-50 features, handcrafted descriptors, and DINOv2 transformer embeddings, tested on the CBIS-DDSM dataset.

Result: Improved AUC to 79.6%, peak recall of 80.5%, and highest F1 score of 67.4%, outperforming ResNet-50 alone.

Conclusion: The hybrid fusion approach is practical and effective for clinical decision support, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Automated breast cancer classification from mammography remains a significant
challenge due to subtle distinctions between benign and malignant tissue. In
this work, we present a hybrid framework combining deep convolutional features
from a ResNet-50 backbone with handcrafted descriptors and transformer-based
embeddings. Using the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we benchmark our ResNet-50 baseline
(AUC: 78.1%) and demonstrate that fusing handcrafted features with deep
ResNet-50 and DINOv2 features improves AUC to 79.6% (setup d1), with a peak
recall of 80.5% (setup d1) and highest F1 score of 67.4% (setup d1). Our
experiments show that handcrafted features not only complement deep
representations but also enhance performance beyond transformer-based
embeddings. This hybrid fusion approach achieves results comparable to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining architectural simplicity and
computational efficiency, making it a practical and effective solution for
clinical decision support.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores how SSFL++ and KDS preprocessing improves multi-source CT-scan classification by reducing domain shifts, enhancing cross-source generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-source CT-scan classification faces challenges due to domain shifts, and existing methods' robustness mechanisms are not well understood.

Method: The study uses SSFL++ and KDS for spatial and temporal standardization to align disparate inputs into a consistent target space.

Result: The pipeline reduces inter-source variance, mitigates domain shift, and improves performance across architectures, validated by winning a competitive challenge.

Conclusion: Input-space standardization via SSFL++ and KDS is a robust solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair
cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining
Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling
(KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain
robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space
standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and
cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and
temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping
disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment
mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network
optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements
across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself.
The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a
competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and
practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel method uses Stable Diffusion-2.0 to generate synthetic skin lesion images and masks, improving model performance in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data scarcity and class imbalance in medical imaging for better disease diagnosis.

Method: Adapts Stable Diffusion-2.0 via LoRA fine-tuning and multi-objective loss optimization to generate images and masks.

Result: Synthetic data improves classification and segmentation models by 8-15% in accuracy and F1-score.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable solution for medical imaging challenges, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image analysis plays a pivotal role in the early diagnosis of
diseases such as skin lesions. However, the scarcity of data and the class
imbalance significantly hinder the performance of deep learning models. We
propose a novel method that leverages the pretrained Stable Diffusion-2.0 model
to generate high-quality synthetic skin lesion images and corresponding
segmentation masks. This approach augments training datasets for classification
and segmentation tasks. We adapt Stable Diffusion-2.0 through domain-specific
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and joint optimization of
multi-objective loss functions, enabling the model to simultaneously generate
clinically relevant images and segmentation masks conditioned on textual
descriptions in a single step. Experimental results show that the generated
images, validated by FID scores, closely resemble real images in quality. A
hybrid dataset combining real and synthetic data markedly enhances the
performance of classification and segmentation models, achieving substantial
improvements in accuracy and F1-score of 8% to 15%, with additional positive
gains in other key metrics such as the Dice coefficient and IoU. Our approach
offers a scalable solution to address the challenges of medical imaging data,
contributing to improved accuracy and reliability in diagnosing rare diseases.

*Davide Piccinini,Diego Valsesia,Enrico Magli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A lightweight neural network (DPSR) is proposed for real-time hyperspectral image super-resolution onboard satellites, matching pushbroom acquisition and outperforming complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have high spectral but low spatial resolution, limiting detection capabilities. Lightweight methods are needed for onboard satellite processing.

Method: DPSR processes images line-by-line with a causal memory mechanism, reducing memory and computational demands for real-time performance.

Result: DPSR achieves competitive or superior super-resolution quality compared to complex methods while enabling real-time processing on low-power hardware.

Conclusion: DPSR is an efficient solution for onboard hyperspectral image super-resolution, balancing performance and computational constraints.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imagers on satellites obtain the fine spectral signatures
essential for distinguishing one material from another at the expense of
limited spatial resolution. Enhancing the latter is thus a desirable
preprocessing step in order to further improve the detection capabilities
offered by hyperspectral images on downstream tasks. At the same time, there is
a growing interest towards deploying inference methods directly onboard of
satellites, which calls for lightweight image super-resolution methods that can
be run on the payload in real time. In this paper, we present a novel neural
network design, called Deep Pushbroom Super-Resolution (DPSR) that matches the
pushbroom acquisition of hyperspectral sensors by processing an image line by
line in the along-track direction with a causal memory mechanism to exploit
previously acquired lines. This design greatly limits memory requirements and
computational complexity, achieving onboard real-time performance, i.e., the
ability to super-resolve a line in the time it takes to acquire the next one,
on low-power hardware. Experiments show that the quality of the super-resolved
images is competitive or even outperforms state-of-the-art methods that are
significantly more complex.

### [550] [Implicit Spatiotemporal Bandwidth Enhancement Filter by Sine-activated Deep Learning Model for Fast 3D Photoacoustic Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20575)
*I Gede Eka Sulistyawan,Takuro Ishii,Riku Suzuki,Yoshifumi Saijo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A 3D photoacoustic tomography method using deep learning with sine activation to restore broadband signals from sparse, bandlimited sensors, improving image quality and enabling fast imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited sensor channels and bandlimited sampling degrade image quality in 3D-PAT, necessitating a solution to restore broadband signals and enhance sensitivity.

Method: A 2D deep learning model with sine activation is applied to sensor-wise PA radio-frequency data, trained on simulated random spherical absorbers due to scarce 3D data.

Result: The model effectively increased sensor density, recovered bandwidth, and enhanced high-frequency content, yielding clearer vascular structures with fewer artifacts. Quantitative improvements included full bandwidth at -12 dB and higher contrast-to-noise ratio.

Conclusion: The sine-activated DL model generalizes well across tests, enabling fast 3D-PAT imaging at 2 volumes-per-second for practical applications like free-moving targets.

Abstract: 3D photoacoustic tomography (3D-PAT) using high-frequency hemispherical
transducers offers near-omnidirectional reception and enhanced sensitivity to
the finer structural details encoded in the high-frequency components of the
broadband photoacoustic (PA) signal. However, practical constraints such as
limited number of channels with bandlimited sampling rate often result in
sparse and bandlimited sensors that degrade image quality. To address this, we
revisit the 2D deep learning (DL) approach applied directly to sensor-wise PA
radio-frequency (PARF) data. Specifically, we introduce sine activation into
the DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed
band-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training
data, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical
absorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is
designed to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model
was evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom
and in-vivo human palm vasculature. The results showed that the proposed
training mechanism on sine-activated model was well-generalized across the
different tests by effectively increasing the sensor density and recovering the
spatiotemporal bandwidth. Qualitatively, the sine-activated model uniquely
enhanced high-frequency content that produces clearer vascular structure with
fewer artefacts. Quantitatively, the sine-activated model exhibits full
bandwidth at -12 dB spectrum and significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio
with minimal loss of structural similarity index. Lastly, we optimized our
approach to enable fast enhanced 3D-PAT at 2 volumes-per-second for better
practical imaging of a free-moving targets.

### [551] [Aligning Large Language Model Agents with Rational and Moral Preferences: A Supervised Fine-Tuning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20796)
*Wei Lu,Daniel L. Chen,Christian B. Hansen*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLM behavior in strategic interactions, finding deviations from human behavior. It proposes a fine-tuning pipeline to align LLMs with economic preferences, testing in moral dilemmas and markets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and align LLM behavior in economically and morally consequential decisions, as these systems increasingly act autonomously.

Method: Uses canonical economic games to evaluate LLM preferences, then fine-tunes models using synthetic datasets based on two preference structures: homo economicus and homo moralis.

Result: Fine-tuning shifts LLM behavior toward desired economic agents, with applications showing influence on moral and market outcomes.

Conclusion: The work provides a cost-efficient, replicable pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

Abstract: Understanding how large language model (LLM) agents behave in strategic
interactions is essential as these systems increasingly participate
autonomously in economically and morally consequential decisions. We evaluate
LLM preferences using canonical economic games, finding substantial deviations
from human behavior. Models like GPT-4o show excessive cooperation and limited
incentive sensitivity, while reasoning models, such as o3-mini, align more
consistently with payoff-maximizing strategies. We propose a supervised
fine-tuning pipeline that uses synthetic datasets derived from economic
reasoning to align LLM agents with economic preferences, focusing on two
stylized preference structures. In the first, utility depends only on
individual payoffs (homo economicus), while utility also depends on a notion of
Kantian universalizability in the second preference structure (homo moralis).
We find that fine-tuning based on small datasets shifts LLM agent behavior
toward the corresponding economic agent. We further assess the fine-tuned
agents' behavior in two applications: Moral dilemmas involving autonomous
vehicles and algorithmic pricing in competitive markets. These examples
illustrate how different normative objectives embedded via realizations from
structured preference structures can influence market and moral outcomes. This
work contributes a replicable, cost-efficient, and economically grounded
pipeline to align AI preferences using moral-economic principles.

*Mikkel Schöttner Sieler,Thomas A. W. Bolton,Jagruti Patel,Patric Hagmann*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper compares nine feature subtypes from resting-state fMRI for behavior prediction, identifying functional connectivity (FC) as the best for cognition, age, and sex, while graph signal processing (GSP) and variability-based features also show promise. Scaling properties highlight the need to balance sample size and scan time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the most effective neuroimaging features for predicting behavioral variables, aiding the development of biomarkers for mental and neurological disorders.

Method: Comparison of nine feature subtypes (e.g., FC, GSP-derived metrics) from resting-state fMRI in 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project, predicting mental health, cognition, processing speed, substance use, age, and sex. Scaling properties were analyzed for sample size and scan time.

Result: FC was best for predicting cognition, age, and sex. GSP and variability-based features also performed well. No significant predictions for other targets. Scaling analysis suggested performance improves with balanced sample size and scan time.

Conclusion: FC is robust for behavior prediction, but GSP and variability-based features hold potential. Future studies should optimize acquisition strategies and sample composition.

Abstract: Predicting behavioral variables from neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to allow the development of
neuroimaging biomarkers of mental and neurological disorders. A crucial
processing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features. These can
differ in how well they predict the target of interest, and how this prediction
scales with sample size and scan time. Here, we compare nine feature subtypes
extracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction,
ranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional
connectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a
principled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional
features. We study 979 subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult
dataset, predicting summary scores for mental health, cognition, processing
speed, and substance use, as well as age and sex. The scaling properties of the
features are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan
time. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex.
Graph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and
age, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well. When
predicting sex, the low-pass graph filtered coupled FC slightly outperforms the
simple FC variant. None of the other targets were predicted significantly. The
scaling results point to higher performance reserves for the better-performing
features. They also indicate that it is important to balance sample size and
scan time when acquiring data for prediction studies. The results confirm FC as
a robust feature for behavior prediction, but also show the potential of GSP
and variability-based measures. We discuss the implications for future
prediction studies in terms of strategies for acquisition and sample
composition.

TL;DR: 1D-CGS is a hybrid model combining 1D-CNN and GraphSAGE for efficient node ranking in networks, outperforming traditional and deep learning methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying influential nodes in networks face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Method: 1D-CGS integrates 1D-CNN for local pattern extraction and GraphSAGE for neighborhood aggregation, using node degree and average neighbor degree as features. It trains on synthetic networks and applies to real-world networks.

Result: 1D-CGS outperforms baselines with 4.73% higher Kendall's Tau, 7.67% higher Jaccard Similarity, and near-perfect Monotonicity Index (0.99), while being faster.

Conclusion: 1D-CGS is a highly accurate and efficient solution for large-scale node ranking tasks.

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a critical task with a
wide range of applications across different domains. However, existing
approaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.
To address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective
hybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural
networks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for
efficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built
on two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and
average neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions
to extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate
neighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression
problem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate
ground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic
networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world
networks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve
real world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms
traditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking
accuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an
average improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard
Similarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves
an average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank
distributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings.
Furthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly
reasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning
methods, making it suitable for large scale applications.

TL;DR: The paper examines knowledge conflicts in LLMs used in finance, focusing on their investment biases and confirmation tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in finance face knowledge conflicts due to discrepancies between pre-trained data and real-time market info, leading to unreliable recommendations. Little research exists on LLMs' actual investment views.

Method: An experimental framework tests LLMs' latent preferences using hypothetical scenarios with balanced/imbalanced arguments, focusing on sector, size, and momentum.

Result: LLMs show distinct biases, like favoring large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies, often hardening into confirmation bias despite counter-evidence.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' confirmation biases in investment analysis, urging caution in their real-world financial deployment.

Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts
due to discrepancies between pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time
market data. These conflicts become particularly problematic when LLMs are
deployed in real-world investment services, where misalignment between a
model's embedded preferences and those of the financial institution can lead to
unreliable recommendations. Yet little research has examined what investment
views LLMs actually hold. We propose an experimental framework to investigate
such conflicts, offering the first quantitative analysis of confirmation bias
in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced
and imbalanced arguments, we extract models' latent preferences and measure
their persistence. Focusing on sector, size, and momentum, our analysis reveals
distinct, model-specific tendencies. In particular, we observe a consistent
preference for large-cap stocks and contrarian strategies across most models.
These preferences often harden into confirmation bias, with models clinging to
initial judgments despite counter-evidence.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent system for managing crypto portfolios, comparing static and dynamic strategies. The dynamic approach outperforms in risk-adjusted returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of managing volatile crypto portfolios using adaptive techniques.

Method: Uses a multi-agent system (Crew AI) to implement static equal weighting and dynamic rolling-window optimization strategies, evaluated using MPT metrics.

Result: Dynamic optimization outperforms static strategy in risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample.

Conclusion: Adaptive techniques and multi-agent systems are effective for crypto portfolio management, offering scalability and flexibility.

Abstract: The rapid growth of crypto markets has opened new opportunities for
investors, but at the same time exposed them to high volatility. To address the
challenge of managing dynamic portfolios in such an environment, this paper
presents a practical application of a multi-agent system designed to
autonomously construct and evaluate crypto-asset allocations. Using data on
daily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to
2025, we compare two automated investment strategies. These are a static equal
weighting strategy and a rolling-window optimization strategy, both implemented
to maximize the evaluation metrics of the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), such
as Expected Return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios, while minimizing volatility.
Each step of the process is handled by dedicated agents, integrated through a
collaborative architecture in Crew AI. The results show that the dynamic
optimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of
risk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the
benefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in
volatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets. The following methodology
proposed also demonstrates how multi-agent systems can provide scalable,
auditable, and flexible solutions in financial automation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a machine unlearning framework for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) systems to selectively remove knowledge of unwanted speaker identities while preserving performance for others.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy and ethical concerns in ZS-TTS by enabling the removal of specific speaker identities from pre-trained models.

Method: Proposes Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), incorporating randomness to prevent replication of forgotten voices, and introduces the spk-ZRF metric for evaluation.

Result: TGU effectively prevents replication of forgotten speakers' voices while maintaining high-quality synthesis for others.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses speaker identity unlearning in ZS-TTS, balancing privacy and performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech (ZS-TTS) technology has
enabled high-fidelity voice synthesis from minimal audio cues, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. Despite the threats to voice privacy,
research to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual
voices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper,
we address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems.
To meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for
ZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the
model forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to
generate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate
randomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices,
assuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a
new evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF). This assesses
the model's ability to disregard prompts associated with forgotten speakers,
effectively neutralizing its knowledge of these voices. The experiments
conducted on the state-of-the-art model demonstrate that TGU prevents the model
from replicating forget speakers' voices while maintaining high quality for
other speakers. The demo is available at https://speechunlearn.github.io/

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Few-shot methods outperform zero-shot audio classification by grouping audio embeddings and replacing noisy text embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving classification accuracy beyond zero-shot approaches, especially for diverse audio classes.

Method: Group audio embeddings by class and process them to replace noisy text embeddings.

Result: Few-shot classification generally surpasses zero-shot baseline performance.

Conclusion: Few-shot methods are more effective for audio classification than zero-shot approaches.

Abstract: State-of-the-art audio classification often employs a zero-shot approach,
which involves comparing audio embeddings with embeddings from text describing
the respective audio class. These embeddings are usually generated by neural
networks trained through contrastive learning to align audio and text
representations. Identifying the optimal text description for an audio class is
challenging, particularly when the class comprises a wide variety of sounds.
This paper examines few-shot methods designed to improve classification
accuracy beyond the zero-shot approach. Specifically, audio embeddings are
grouped by class and processed to replace the inherently noisy text embeddings.
Our results demonstrate that few-shot classification typically outperforms the

*Nouhaila Fraihi,Ouassim Karrakchou,Mounir Ghogho*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A compact CNN-TSA network with Frequency Band Selection (FBS) improves respiratory sound classification by combining CNNs and self-attention, reducing computational costs while achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for respiratory sound classification struggle with balancing local feature extraction (CNNs) and long-range dependency modeling (transformers), often at high computational costs.

Method: Proposes CNN-TSA, integrating lightweight self-attention into a CNN backbone, and introduces FBS to filter noisy frequencies. Age-specific models are added for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SPRSound-2022/2023 and ICBHI-2017 datasets with 50% fewer FLOPs. FBS also enhances transformer baselines.

Conclusion: The framework enables reliable, real-time respiratory sound analysis, suitable for resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Accurate classification of respiratory sounds requires deep learning models
that effectively capture fine-grained acoustic features and long-range temporal
dependencies. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well-suited for
extracting local time-frequency patterns but are limited in modeling global
context. In contrast, transformer-based models can capture long-range
dependencies, albeit with higher computational demands. To address these
limitations, we propose a compact CNN-Temporal Self-Attention (CNN-TSA) network
that integrates lightweight self-attention into an efficient CNN backbone.
Central to our approach is a Frequency Band Selection (FBS) module that
suppresses noisy and non-informative frequency regions, substantially improving
accuracy and reducing FLOPs by up to 50%. We also introduce age-specific models
to enhance robustness across diverse patient groups. Evaluated on the
SPRSound-2022/2023 and ICBHI-2017 lung sound datasets, CNN-TSA with FBS sets
new benchmarks on SPRSound and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ICBHI,
all with a significantly smaller computational footprint. Furthermore,
integrating FBS into an existing transformer baseline yields a new record on
ICBHI, confirming FBS as an effective drop-in enhancement. These results
demonstrate that our framework enables reliable, real-time respiratory sound
analysis suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: JAM introduces a flow-matching-based model for lyrics-to-song generation with word-level timing control, outperforming existing models and standardizing evaluation with the JAME dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lyrics-to-song models lack fine-grained word-level controllability desired by musicians, and there's a need for better alignment with human preferences.

Method: JAM uses flow-matching for word-level timing control and Direct Preference Optimization for aesthetic alignment, refining the model with synthetic data.

Result: JAM outperforms existing models in music-specific attributes and introduces the JAME dataset for standardized evaluation.

Conclusion: JAM advances lyrics-to-song generation with fine-grained control and improved quality, setting a new standard for evaluation.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching models have revolutionized automatic
text-to-audio generation in recent times. These models are increasingly capable
of generating high quality and faithful audio outputs capturing to speech and
acoustic events. However, there is still much room for improvement in creative
audio generation that primarily involves music and songs. Recent open
lyrics-to-song models, such as, DiffRhythm, ACE-Step, and LeVo, have set an
acceptable standard in automatic song generation for recreational use. However,
these models lack fine-grained word-level controllability often desired by
musicians in their workflows. To the best of our knowledge, our
flow-matching-based JAM is the first effort toward endowing word-level timing
and duration control in song generation, allowing fine-grained vocal control.
To enhance the quality of generated songs to better align with human
preferences, we implement aesthetic alignment through Direct Preference
Optimization, which iteratively refines the model using a synthetic dataset,
eliminating the need or manual data annotations. Furthermore, we aim to
standardize the evaluation of such lyrics-to-song models through our public
evaluation dataset JAME. We show that JAM outperforms the existing models in
terms of the music-specific attributes.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Music Arena is an open platform for scalable human preference evaluation of text-to-music models, addressing gaps in current evaluation methods by offering live, standardized, and music-specific assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human preference evaluations for text-to-music models are costly, inconsistent, and lack open, renewable data. Music Arena aims to provide a transparent, scalable solution.

Method: The platform allows real-world users to compare outputs from two TTM systems, collects detailed preferences (listening data, feedback), and uses an LLM-based routing system for heterogeneous TTM systems.

Result: Music Arena compiles a leaderboard of preferences and proposes a rolling data release policy with privacy guarantees, offering a renewable source of evaluation data.

Conclusion: Music Arena standardizes TTM evaluation, enhances transparency, and demonstrates how live evaluation can be tailored to domain-specific needs in AI.

Abstract: We present Music Arena, an open platform for scalable human preference
evaluation of text-to-music (TTM) models. Soliciting human preferences via
listening studies is the gold standard for evaluation in TTM, but these studies
are expensive to conduct and difficult to compare, as study protocols may
differ across systems. Moreover, human preferences might help researchers align
their TTM systems or improve automatic evaluation metrics, but an open and
renewable source of preferences does not currently exist. We aim to fill these
gaps by offering *live* evaluation for TTM. In Music Arena, real-world users
input text prompts of their choosing and compare outputs from two TTM systems,
and their preferences are used to compile a leaderboard. While Music Arena
follows recent evaluation trends in other AI domains, we also design it with
key features tailored to music: an LLM-based routing system to navigate the
heterogeneous type signatures of TTM systems, and the collection of *detailed*
preferences including listening data and natural language feedback. We also
propose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a
renewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.
Through its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,
and music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in
the TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully
adapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.

TL;DR: CrysVCD is a modular framework for inverse materials design that integrates chemical rules into generative models, ensuring valence balance and improving efficiency and stability in generated materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based generative models often ignore chemical constraints like oxidation state balance, leading to invalid structures. CrysVCD addresses this gap by embedding chemical rules directly into the generative process.

Method: CrysVCD uses a transformer-based elemental language model for valence-balanced compositions and a diffusion model for crystal structure generation, with valence constraints for efficiency.

Result: CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability and 68% phonon stability when fine-tuned. It also enables conditional generation of functional materials like high thermal conductivity semiconductors.

Conclusion: CrysVCD offers a reliable, scientifically grounded approach for materials discovery by ensuring chemical validity and can be integrated into diverse generative pipelines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based deep generative models have emerged as powerful tools for
inverse materials design. Yet, many existing approaches overlook essential
chemical constraints such as oxidation state balance, which can lead to
chemically invalid structures. Here we introduce CrysVCD (Crystal generator
with Valence-Constrained Design), a modular framework that integrates chemical
rules directly into the generative process. CrysVCD first employs a
transformer-based elemental language model to generate valence-balanced
compositions, followed by a diffusion model to generate crystal structures. The
valence constraint enables orders-of-magnitude more efficient chemical valence
checking, compared to pure data-driven approaches with post-screening. When
fine-tuned on stability metrics, CrysVCD achieves 85% thermodynamic stability
and 68% phonon stability. Moreover, CrysVCD supports conditional generation of
functional materials, enabling discovery of candidates such as high thermal
conductivity semiconductors and high-$\kappa$ dielectric compounds. Designed as
a general-purpose plugin, CrysVCD can be integrated into diverse generative
pipeline to promote chemical validity, offering a reliable, scientifically
grounded path for materials discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models lack trustworthiness and robustness in scientific applications, requiring alignment with domain knowledge for reliable performance.

Method: Attention-guided training integrates explainable AI, quantitative evaluation, and domain-specific priors to guide model attention during training.

Result: The approach improves generalization and ensures model focus on physically relevant regions, validated on semantic crack tip segmentation.

Conclusion: Attention-guided training enhances model reliability and interpretability by aligning attention with domain-specific insights.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness and robustness of deep learning models remains a
fundamental challenge, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications. In
this study, we present a framework called attention-guided training that
combines explainable artificial intelligence techniques with quantitative
evaluation and domain-specific priors to guide model attention. We demonstrate
that domain specific feedback on model explanations during training can enhance
the model's generalization capabilities. We validate our approach on the task
of semantic crack tip segmentation in digital image correlation data which is a
key application in the fracture mechanical characterization of materials. By
aligning model attention with physically meaningful stress fields, such as
those described by Williams' analytical solution, attention-guided training
ensures that the model focuses on physically relevant regions. This finally
leads to improved generalization and more faithful explanations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: PennyCoder is a lightweight framework for local quantum code generation, avoiding remote API reliance by using a fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1-8B model with LoRA and domain-specific tuning, achieving 44.3% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based quantum code assistants depend on remote APIs, causing privacy, latency, and cost issues. PennyCoder addresses this by enabling on-device quantum programming assistance.

Method: Fine-tuned LLaMA 3.1-8B model using LoRA and domain-specific instruction tuning for PennyLane, focusing on quantum machine learning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieved 44.3% accuracy, outperforming the base LLaMA 3.1-8B (33.7%) and RAG-augmented baseline (40.1%).

Conclusion: PennyCoder provides a device-native, efficient solution for quantum code generation, significantly improving accuracy and reducing reliance on external APIs.

Abstract: The growing demand for robust quantum programming frameworks has unveiled a
critical limitation: current large language model (LLM) based quantum code
assistants heavily rely on remote APIs, introducing challenges related to
privacy, latency, and excessive usage costs. Addressing this gap, we propose
PennyCoder, a novel lightweight framework for quantum code generation,
explicitly designed for local and embedded deployment to enable on-device
quantum programming assistance without external API dependence. PennyCoder
leverages a fine-tuned version of the LLaMA 3.1-8B model, adapted through
parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques combined with
domain-specific instruction tuning optimized for the specialized syntax and
computational logic of quantum programming in PennyLane, including tasks in
quantum machine learning and quantum reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work
focused on cloud-based quantum code generation, our approach emphasizes
device-native operability while maintaining high model efficacy. We rigorously
evaluated PennyCoder over a comprehensive quantum programming dataset,
achieving 44.3% accuracy with our fine-tuned model (compared to 33.7% for the
base LLaMA 3.1-8B and 40.1% for the RAG-augmented baseline), demonstrating a
significant improvement in functional correctness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of local measurements in VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning.

Method: ANO-VQC integrates adaptive non-local observables into VQCs, used in DQN and A3C algorithms.

Result: ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs on benchmark tasks, with adaptive measurements enhancing function space.

Conclusion: Adaptive multi-qubit observables enable practical quantum advantages in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical frameworks leverage quantum computing for machine
learning; however, variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are limited by the need
for local measurements. We introduce an adaptive non-local observable (ANO)
paradigm within VQCs for quantum reinforcement learning (QRL), jointly
optimizing circuit parameters and multi-qubit measurements. The ANO-VQC
architecture serves as the function approximator in Deep Q-Network (DQN) and
Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms. On multiple benchmark
tasks, ANO-VQC agents outperform baseline VQCs. Ablation studies reveal that
adaptive measurements enhance the function space without increasing circuit
depth. Our results demonstrate that adaptive multi-qubit observables can enable
practical quantum advantages in reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: A quantum-informed machine learning framework is introduced for learning chaotic systems, combining quantum circuit Born machines with classical models for improved efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in learning chaotic systems include instability in long-term predictions and capturing invariant statistical properties. Quantum machine learning offers potential but faces hardware noise and scalability issues.

Method: A quantum circuit Born machine learns invariant properties of chaotic systems, reducing data storage needs. This is integrated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address gradient issues.

Result: The framework outperforms classical models in three chaotic systems, achieving better efficiency and statistical fidelity.

Conclusion: The hybrid quantum-classical approach provides a practical solution for learning dynamical systems with near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Learning the behaviour of chaotic systems remains challenging due to
instability in long-term predictions and difficulties in accurately capturing
invariant statistical properties. While quantum machine learning offers a
promising route to efficiently capture physical properties from
high-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware
noise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning
framework for learning partial differential equations, with an application
focus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn
the invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial
memory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a
compact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data
storage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw
simulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then
incorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such
as gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical
fidelity. The framework is evaluated on three representative systems: the
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow and turbulent
channel flow. In all cases, the quantum-informed model achieves superior
performance compared to its classical counterparts without quantum priors. This
hybrid architecture offers a practical route for learning dynamical systems
using near-term quantum hardware.

Motivation: To improve parameter estimation in decision-making models by leveraging response time data, enhancing predictive accuracy and economic relevance.

Result: Demonstrated in an intertemporal choice experiment, showing improved predictive accuracy and impact on economically relevant parameter estimation.

Conclusion: Response time data enhances parameter estimation and predictive accuracy in decision-making models, with broad applicability.

Abstract: We propose a general methodology for recovering preference parameters from
data on choices and response times. Our methods yield estimates with fast
($1/n$ for $n$ data points) convergence rates when specialized to the popular
Drift Diffusion Model (DDM), but are broadly applicable to generalizations of
the DDM as well as to alternative models of decision making that make use of
response time data. The paper develops an empirical application to an
experiment on intertemporal choice, showing that the use of response times
delivers predictive accuracy and matters for the estimation of economically
relevant parameters.

TL;DR: The paper exposes security flaws in the Model Context Protocol (MCP), showing how simple attacks can exploit its trust model to steal financial data.


<details>

Motivation: To highlight the overlooked security risks in MCP's integration of AI agents and external services, demonstrating how low-skill attackers can exploit it.

Method: A proof-of-concept attack using a malicious MCP server to exploit banking tools and exfiltrate sensitive data.

Result: Reveals a critical security gap in MCP, showing trivial cross-server attacks are possible with minimal technical skills.

Conclusion: Urges immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to secure the MCP ecosystem against low-barrier threats.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in
AI-tool integration, enabling seamless communication between AI agents and
external services. However, this connectivity introduces novel attack vectors
that remain largely unexplored. This paper demonstrates how unsophisticated
threat actors, requiring only basic programming skills and free web tools, can
exploit MCP's trust model to exfiltrate sensitive financial data. We present a
proof-of-concept attack where a malicious weather MCP server, disguised as
benign functionality, discovers and exploits legitimate banking tools to steal
user account balances. The attack chain requires no advanced technical
knowledge, server infrastructure, or monetary investment. The findings reveal a
critical security gap in the emerging MCP ecosystem: while individual servers
may appear trustworthy, their combination creates unexpected cross-server
attack surfaces. Unlike traditional cybersecurity threats that assume
sophisticated adversaries, our research shows that the barrier to entry for
MCP-based attacks is alarmingly low. A threat actor with undergraduate-level
Python knowledge can craft convincing social engineering attacks that exploit
the implicit trust relationships MCP establishes between AI agents and tool
providers. This work contributes to the nascent field of MCP security by
demonstrating that current MCP implementations allow trivial cross-server
attacks and proposing both immediate mitigations and protocol improvements to
secure this emerging ecosystem.

privacy-preserving and policy-aware AI techniques, including Federated

practitioners and researchers to navigate trade-offs. Key performance metrics
-- latency, throughput, cost overhead, model utility, fairness, and
explainability -- are analyzed to highlight the multi-dimensional optimization
required in dataspaces. The paper identifies critical research gaps, including
the lack of standardized privacy-performance KPIs, challenges in explainable AI
for federated ecosystems, and semantic policy enforcement amidst regulatory

*Bilal Hussain Abbasi,Zirui Gong,Yanjun Zhang,Shang Gao,Antonio Robles-Kelly,Leo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces ConSeg, a backdoor attack method for semantic segmentation models that leverages contextual information to improve attack success rates and evade defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can misclassify victim classes as target classes when triggers are present, threatening model reliability.

Method: ConSeg exploits contextual relationships by setting the target class as the 'co-occurring' class of the victim class, mimicking and rebuilding contextual information to enhance attack effectiveness.

Result: ConSeg improves Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 15.55% over existing methods and resists state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: ConSeg demonstrates the effectiveness of contextual information in backdoor attacks, highlighting vulnerabilities in semantic segmentation models.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in computer vision, semantic segmentation
models may be susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks, involving hidden
triggers, aim to cause the models to misclassify instances of the victim class
as the target class when triggers are present, posing serious threats to the
reliability of these models. To further explore the field of backdoor attacks
against semantic segmentation, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
backdoor attack called Contextual Segmentation Backdoor Attack (ConSeg). ConSeg
leverages the contextual information inherent in semantic segmentation models
to enhance backdoor performance. Our method is motivated by an intriguing
observation, i.e., when the target class is set as the `co-occurring' class of
the victim class, the victim class can be more easily `mis-segmented'. Building
upon this insight, ConSeg mimics the contextual information of the target class
and rebuilds it in the victim region to establish the contextual relationship
between the target class and the victim class, making the attack easier. Our
experiments reveal that ConSeg achieves improvements in Attack Success Rate
(ASR) with increases of 15.55\%, compared to existing methods, while exhibiting
resilience against state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

TL;DR: Proposes Hot-Swap MarkBoard, a method for embedding unique watermarks in on-device DL models without retraining, ensuring IP protection and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses IP risks in on-device DL models by enabling unique watermarking for each user, overcoming limitations of fixed-watermark solutions.

Method: Uses multi-branch LoRA modules to embed n-bit binary signatures, allowing watermark customization via branch swapping and parameter obfuscation.

Result: Achieves 100% verification accuracy across various tasks and models, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard is efficient, adaptable, and effective for protecting IP in distributed on-device DL models.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

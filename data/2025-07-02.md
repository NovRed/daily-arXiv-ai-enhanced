### [1] [Moment Sampling in Video LLMs for Long-Form Video QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00033)
*Mustafa Chasmai,Gauri Jagatap,Gouthaman KV,Grant Van Horn,Subhransu Maji,Andrea Fanelli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'moment sampling' to improve frame selection in Video LLMs for long-form VideoQA, outperforming traditional sub-sampling by focusing on question-relevant frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video LLMs struggle with long-range reasoning in longer videos due to suboptimal frame sub-sampling, which loses key frames or includes redundant ones.

Method: Proposes 'moment sampling' using a lightweight text-to-video moment retrieval model to select question-relevant frames, enhancing VideoQA performance.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets with four Video LLMs show the method's effectiveness in improving long-form VideoQA.

Conclusion: Moment sampling is a model-agnostic solution that significantly enhances Video LLMs' performance on long videos by optimizing frame selection.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video large language models (Video LLMs) have
significantly advanced the field of video question answering (VideoQA). While
existing methods perform well on short videos, they often struggle with
long-range reasoning in longer videos. To scale Video LLMs for longer video
content, frame sub-sampling (selecting frames at regular intervals) is commonly
used. However, this approach is suboptimal, often leading to the loss of
crucial frames or the inclusion of redundant information from multiple similar
frames. Missing key frames impairs the model's ability to answer questions
accurately, while redundant frames lead the model to focus on irrelevant video
segments and increase computational resource consumption. In this paper, we
investigate the use of a general-purpose text-to-video moment retrieval model
to guide the frame sampling process. We propose "moment sampling", a novel,
model-agnostic approach that enables the model to select the most relevant
frames according to the context of the question. Specifically, we employ a
lightweight moment retrieval model to prioritize frame selection. By focusing
on the frames most pertinent to the given question, our method enhances
long-form VideoQA performance in Video LLMs. Through extensive experiments on
four long-form VideoQA datasets, using four state-of-the-art Video LLMs, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### [2] [Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation via Discrepancy-Weighted Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00042)
*Xinrun Xu,Jianwen Yang,Qiuhong Zhang,Zhanbiao Lian,Zhiming Ding,Shan Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ER-EMU, an edge model update algorithm, uses adaptive experience replay and a novel domain distance metric to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in traffic monitoring, improving performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in cloud-edge collaborative object detection for traffic monitoring, especially in dynamic environments with periodic variations, necessitates better knowledge retention and adaptation methods.

Method: ER-EMU employs a FIFO-managed experience buffer and DDM-ES algorithm using MK-MMD to prioritize dissimilar historical data, ensuring training diversity and balanced domain representation.

Result: Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset show ER-EMU consistently enhances performance of state-of-the-art frameworks.

Conclusion: ER-EMU effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting by leveraging adaptive experience replay and domain distance metrics, improving model adaptability in dynamic traffic environments.

Abstract: Continually adapting edge models in cloud-edge collaborative object detection
for traffic monitoring suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where models lose
previously learned knowledge when adapting to new data distributions. This is
especially problematic in dynamic traffic environments characterised by
periodic variations (e.g., day/night, peak hours), where past knowledge remains
valuable. Existing approaches like experience replay and visual prompts offer
some mitigation, but struggle to effectively prioritize and leverage historical
data for optimal knowledge retention and adaptation. Specifically, simply
storing and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating
all historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying
relevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model
update algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these
limitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a
First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based
Experience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel
maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target
domains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar
to the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates
the retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also
preventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated
using a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation
of previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,
involving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently
improves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative
object detection frameworks.

### [3] [MR-CLIP: Efficient Metadata-Guided Learning of MRI Contrast Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00043)
*Mehmet Yigit Avci,Pedro Borges,Paul Wright,Mehmet Yigitsoy,Sebastien Ourselin,Jorge Cardoso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-CLIP is a multimodal contrastive learning framework that aligns MRI images with DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware representations without manual labels, improving tasks like cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of reliable and standardized metadata in MRI scans complicates image interpretation and clinical workflows, necessitating robust contrast-aware representations.

Method: Proposes MR-CLIP, a contrastive learning framework aligning MR images with DICOM metadata, trained on diverse clinical datasets.

Result: MR-CLIP captures contrast variations, enabling anatomy-invariant representations and excelling in cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification.

Conclusion: MR-CLIP offers a scalable solution for contrast-aware representations, with potential for advanced clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans in clinical
systems is based on a precise understanding of image contrast. This contrast is
primarily governed by acquisition parameters, such as echo time and repetition
time, which are stored in the DICOM metadata. To simplify contrast
identification, broad labels such as T1-weighted or T2-weighted are commonly
used, but these offer only a coarse approximation of the underlying acquisition
settings. In many real-world datasets, such labels are entirely missing,
leaving raw acquisition parameters as the only indicators of contrast. Adding
to this challenge, the available metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or
inconsistent. The lack of reliable and standardized metadata complicates tasks
such as image interpretation, retrieval, and integration into clinical
workflows. Furthermore, robust contrast-aware representations are essential to
enable more advanced clinical applications, such as achieving
modality-invariant representations and data harmonization. To address these
challenges, we propose MR-CLIP, a multimodal contrastive learning framework
that aligns MR images with their DICOM metadata to learn contrast-aware
representations, without relying on manual labels. Trained on a diverse
clinical dataset that spans various scanners and protocols, MR-CLIP captures
contrast variations across acquisitions and within scans, enabling
anatomy-invariant representations. We demonstrate its effectiveness in
cross-modal retrieval and contrast classification, highlighting its scalability
and potential for further clinical applications. The code and weights are
publicly available at https://github.com/myigitavci/MR-CLIP.

### [4] [HistoART: Histopathology Artifact Detection and Reporting Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00044)
*Seyed Kahaki,Alexander R. Webber,Ghada Zamzmi,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Rucha Deshpande,Aldo Badano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper compares three methods for detecting artifacts in Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) in cancer diagnostics, with the foundation model-based approach (FMA) outperforming deep learning and knowledge-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Artifacts in WSIs can compromise diagnostic accuracy, necessitating robust detection methods.

Method: Three approaches were tested: FMA (fine-tuned UNI architecture), DLA (ResNet50 backbone), and KBA (handcrafted features).

Result: FMA achieved the highest AUROC (0.995), outperforming DLA (0.977) and KBA (0.940).

Conclusion: The FMA is highly effective for artifact detection, and a quality report scorecard was developed for actionable insights.

Abstract: In modern cancer diagnostics, Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) is widely used to
digitize tissue specimens for detailed, high-resolution examination; however,
other diagnostic approaches, such as liquid biopsy and molecular testing, are
also utilized based on the cancer type and clinical context. While WSI has
revolutionized digital histopathology by enabling automated, precise analysis,
it remains vulnerable to artifacts introduced during slide preparation and
scanning. These artifacts can compromise downstream image analysis. To address
this challenge, we propose and compare three robust artifact detection
approaches for WSIs: (1) a foundation model-based approach (FMA) using a
fine-tuned Unified Neural Image (UNI) architecture, (2) a deep learning
approach (DLA) built on a ResNet50 backbone, and (3) a knowledge-based approach
(KBA) leveraging handcrafted features from texture, color, and frequency-based
metrics. The methods target six common artifact types: tissue folds,
out-of-focus regions, air bubbles, tissue damage, marker traces, and blood
contamination. Evaluations were conducted on 50,000+ image patches from diverse
scanners (Hamamatsu, Philips, Leica Aperio AT2) across multiple sites. The FMA
achieved the highest patch-wise AUROC of 0.995 (95% CI [0.994, 0.995]),
outperforming the ResNet50-based method (AUROC: 0.977, 95% CI [0.977, 0.978])
and the KBA (AUROC: 0.940, 95% CI [0.933, 0.946]). To translate detection into
actionable insights, we developed a quality report scorecard that quantifies
high-quality patches and visualizes artifact distributions.

### [5] [CaughtCheating: Is Your MLLM a Good Cheating Detective? Exploring the Boundary of Visual Perception and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00045)
*Ming Li,Chenguang Wang,Yijun Liang,Xiyao Wang,Yuhang Zhou,Xiyang Wu,Yuqing Zhang,Ruiyi Zhang,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'CaughtCheating,' a challenging scenario where MLLMs like GPT-o3 fail, highlighting gaps in their visual perception and reasoning compared to human detectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for MLLMs are no longer challenging due to their near-ceiling performance, prompting the need for harder tasks like CaughtCheating to test their limits.

Method: The study investigates scenarios where GPT-o3 struggles, particularly in detecting subtle clues in images (inspired by social media requests), and analyzes the reasons for its failure.

Result: GPT-o3's performance drops to nearly zero in the CaughtCheating scenario, revealing limitations in visual perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: CaughtCheating serves as a valuable benchmark for advancing MLLMs toward human-level detective capabilities, emphasizing the need for further research.

Abstract: Recent agentic Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-o3 have
achieved near-ceiling scores on various existing benchmarks, motivating a
demand for more challenging test tasks. These MLLMs have been reported to excel
in a few expert-level tasks for humans, e.g., GeoGuesser, reflecting their
potential as a detective who can notice minuscule cues in an image and weave
them into coherent, situational explanations, leading to a reliable answer. But
can they match the performance of excellent human detectives? To answer this
question, we investigate some hard scenarios where GPT-o3 can still handle, and
find a common scenario where o3's performance drops to nearly zero, which we
name CaughtCheating. It is inspired by the social media requests that ask
others to detect suspicious clues from photos shared by the poster's partner.
We conduct extensive experiments and analysis to understand why existing MLLMs
lack sufficient capability to solve this kind of task. CaughtCheating provides
a class of challenging visual perception and reasoning tasks with great value
and practical usage. Success in these tasks paves the way for MLLMs to acquire
human-level detective perception and reasoning capabilities.

### [6] [Evolutionary computing-based image segmentation method to detect defects and features in Additive Friction Stir Deposition Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00046)
*Akshansh Mishra,Eyob Mesele Sefene,Shivraman Thapliyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An evolutionary computing approach using PSO for image segmentation in AFSD processes, integrating gradient analysis and distance transforms to detect defects and features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve defect detection and quality assessment in AFSD processes by leveraging advanced image segmentation and visualization techniques.

Method: Combines PSO for threshold optimization with gradient magnitude analysis and distance transforms to create attention-weighted visualizations.

Result: PSO identified optimal thresholds (156-173), and multi-channel visualizations revealed hidden defects and material transitions.

Conclusion: Attention-based analysis effectively detects bonding issues and inhomogeneities, offering quantitative metrics for AFSD process optimization.

Abstract: This work proposes an evolutionary computing-based image segmentation
approach for analyzing soundness in Additive Friction Stir Deposition (AFSD)
processes. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) was employed to determine optimal
segmentation thresholds for detecting defects and features in multilayer AFSD
builds. The methodology integrates gradient magnitude analysis with distance
transforms to create novel attention-weighted visualizations that highlight
critical interface regions. Five AFSD samples processed under different
conditions were analyzed using multiple visualization techniques i.e.
self-attention maps, and multi-channel visualization. These complementary
approaches reveal subtle material transition zones and potential defect regions
which were not readily observable through conventional imaging. The PSO
algorithm automatically identified optimal threshold values (ranging from
156-173) for each sample, enabling precise segmentation of material interfaces.
The multi-channel visualization technique effectively combines boundary
information (red channel), spatial relationships (green channel), and material
density data (blue channel) into cohesive representations that quantify
interface quality. The results demonstrate that attention-based analysis
successfully identifies regions of incomplete bonding and inhomogeneities in
AFSD joints, providing quantitative metrics for process optimization and
quality assessment of additively manufactured components.

### [7] [AdaDeDup: Adaptive Hybrid Data Pruning for Efficient Large-Scale Object Detection Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00049)
*Feiyang Kang,Nadine Chang,Maying Shen,Marc T. Law,Rafid Mahmood,Ruoxi Jia,Jose M. Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaDeDup is a hybrid data pruning framework combining density-based and model-informed methods to efficiently reduce dataset redundancy while preserving critical information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale datasets are computationally burdensome and redundant, making training machine learning models inefficient. Existing pruning methods are either task-agnostic or computationally expensive.

Method: AdaDeDup integrates density-based pruning with model feedback. It partitions data, prunes initially, evaluates impact using a proxy model, and adaptively adjusts pruning thresholds per cluster.

Result: AdaDeDup outperforms baselines, reduces performance degradation (e.g., 54% vs. random sampling on Waymo), and maintains near-original performance while pruning 20% of data.

Conclusion: AdaDeDup enhances data efficiency for large-scale model training, offering a practical solution to dataset redundancy and computational challenges.

Abstract: The computational burden and inherent redundancy of large-scale datasets
challenge the training of contemporary machine learning models. Data pruning
offers a solution by selecting smaller, informative subsets, yet existing
methods struggle: density-based approaches can be task-agnostic, while
model-based techniques may introduce redundancy or prove computationally
prohibitive. We introduce Adaptive De-Duplication (AdaDeDup), a novel hybrid
framework that synergistically integrates density-based pruning with
model-informed feedback in a cluster-adaptive manner. AdaDeDup first partitions
data and applies an initial density-based pruning. It then employs a proxy
model to evaluate the impact of this initial pruning within each cluster by
comparing losses on kept versus pruned samples. This task-aware signal
adaptively adjusts cluster-specific pruning thresholds, enabling more
aggressive pruning in redundant clusters while preserving critical data in
informative ones. Extensive experiments on large-scale object detection
benchmarks (Waymo, COCO, nuScenes) using standard models (BEVFormer, Faster
R-CNN) demonstrate AdaDeDup's advantages. It significantly outperforms
prominent baselines, substantially reduces performance degradation (e.g., over
54% versus random sampling on Waymo), and achieves near-original model
performance while pruning 20% of data, highlighting its efficacy in enhancing
data efficiency for large-scale model training. Code is open-sourced.

### [8] [VSF-Med:A Vulnerability Scoring Framework for Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00052)
*Binesh Sadanandan,Vahid Behzadan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF--Med is a framework for evaluating vulnerabilities in medical Vision Language Models (VLMs) using adversarial attacks, visual perturbations, and a scoring rubric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical VLMs lack systematic security evaluations, posing risks in clinical settings.

Method: VSF--Med combines text-prompt attack templates, visual perturbations, and an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by LLMs.

Result: The framework tested 30,000 adversarial variants, revealing vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art VLMs like Llama-3.2-11B and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: VSF--Med provides a reproducible benchmark for assessing medical VLM security.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) hold great promise for streamlining
labour-intensive medical imaging workflows, yet systematic security evaluations
in clinical settings remain scarce. We introduce VSF--Med, an end-to-end
vulnerability-scoring framework for medical VLMs that unites three novel
components: (i) a rich library of sophisticated text-prompt attack templates
targeting emerging threat vectors; (ii) imperceptible visual perturbations
calibrated by structural similarity (SSIM) thresholds to preserve clinical
realism; and (iii) an eight-dimensional rubric evaluated by two independent
judge LLMs, whose raw scores are consolidated via z-score normalization to
yield a 0--32 composite risk metric. Built entirely on publicly available
datasets and accompanied by open-source code, VSF--Med synthesizes over 30,000
adversarial variants from 5,000 radiology images and enables reproducible
benchmarking of any medical VLM with a single command. Our consolidated
analysis reports mean z-score shifts of $0.90\sigma$ for
persistence-of-attack-effects, $0.74\sigma$ for prompt-injection effectiveness,
and $0.63\sigma$ for safety-bypass success across state-of-the-art VLMs.
Notably, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct exhibits a peak vulnerability increase
of $1.29\sigma$ for persistence-of-attack-effects, while GPT-4o shows increases
of $0.69\sigma$ for that same vector and $0.28\sigma$ for prompt-injection
attacks.

### [9] [MANTA: Cross-Modal Semantic Alignment and Information-Theoretic Optimization for Long-form Multimodal Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00068)
*Ziqi Zhong,Daniel Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANTA is a framework unifying visual and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing with large language models, improving multi-modal learning by addressing alignment, synchronization, representation, and retrieval challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal learning approaches treat modalities separately, leading to inconsistencies in representation and reasoning. MANTA aims to unify and optimize these modalities for better performance.

Method: MANTA uses information-theoretic optimization for semantic alignment, adaptive temporal synchronization, hierarchical content representation, and context-aware retrieval. It formalizes these within a mathematical framework.

Result: MANTA improves state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in accuracy for Long Video Question Answering, with notable gains in temporal reasoning (23.8%) and cross-modal understanding (25.1%).

Conclusion: MANTA establishes new foundations for unifying multi-modal representations through structured text, demonstrating significant performance improvements and novel techniques for redundancy minimization.

Abstract: While multi-modal learning has advanced significantly, current approaches
often treat modalities separately, creating inconsistencies in representation
and reasoning. We introduce MANTA (Multi-modal Abstraction and Normalization
via Textual Alignment), a theoretically-grounded framework that unifies visual
and auditory inputs into a structured textual space for seamless processing
with large language models. MANTA addresses four key challenges: (1) semantic
alignment across modalities with information-theoretic optimization, (2)
adaptive temporal synchronization for varying information densities, (3)
hierarchical content representation for multi-scale understanding, and (4)
context-aware retrieval of sparse information from long sequences. We formalize
our approach within a rigorous mathematical framework, proving its optimality
for context selection under token constraints. Extensive experiments on the
challenging task of Long Video Question Answering show that MANTA improves
state-of-the-art models by up to 22.6% in overall accuracy, with particularly
significant gains (27.3%) on videos exceeding 30 minutes. Additionally, we
demonstrate MANTA's superiority on temporal reasoning tasks (23.8% improvement)
and cross-modal understanding (25.1% improvement). Our framework introduces
novel density estimation techniques for redundancy minimization while
preserving rare signals, establishing new foundations for unifying multimodal
representations through structured text.

TL;DR: The study proposes a transfer learning-based system using YOLOv7 and YOLOv8 for early detection of plant diseases, with YOLOv8 outperforming other methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plant diseases significantly impact agriculture, and early detection is crucial to mitigate damage and improve crop yield.

Method: Utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, fine-tuned on plant leaf images, to detect diseases like Powdery Mildew and Tomato mosaic virus.

Result: Achieved high performance metrics (mAP: 91.05, F1-score: 89.40, Precision: 91.22, Recall: 87.66), with YOLOv8 being superior.

Conclusion: The system offers a scalable, automated solution for early disease detection, enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.

Abstract: Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural
sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to
mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can
severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in
technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring
and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system
designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning
approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two
state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these
models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately
detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery
Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus. The model's
performance was evaluated using several metrics, including mean Average
Precision (mAP), F1-score, Precision, and Recall, yielding values of 91.05,
89.40, 91.22, and 87.66, respectively. The result demonstrates the superior
effectiveness and efficiency of YOLOv8 compared to other object detection
methods, highlighting its potential for use in modern agricultural practices.
The approach provides a scalable, automated solution for early any plant
disease detection, contributing to enhanced crop yield, reduced reliance on
manual monitoring, and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

### [11] [Diffusion-Based Image Augmentation for Semantic Segmentation in Outdoor Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00153)
*Peter Mortimer,Mirko Maehlisch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes diffusion-based image augmentation to improve learning-based perception for autonomous vehicles in underrepresented environments like snow, using foundation models and semantic filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outdoor robots face performance issues in dynamic environments (e.g., snow) due to underrepresented training data. The goal is to adapt perception systems for such conditions.

Method: Uses diffusion-based image augmentation to align training data with deployment environments, leveraging vision foundation models and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation to filter hallucinations.

Result: The method enables fine-tuning models for specific environments (e.g., snow) by controlling semantic distributions in training data.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based augmentation is adaptable to various underrepresented environments (e.g., sand, volcanic terrains) beyond snow.

Abstract: The performance of leaning-based perception algorithms suffer when deployed
in out-of-distribution and underrepresented environments. Outdoor robots are
particularly susceptible to rapid changes in visual scene appearance due to
dynamic lighting, seasonality and weather effects that lead to scenes
underrepresented in the training data of the learning-based perception system.
In this conceptual paper, we focus on preparing our autonomous vehicle for
deployment in snow-filled environments. We propose a novel method for
diffusion-based image augmentation to more closely represent the deployment
environment in our training data. Diffusion-based image augmentations rely on
the public availability of vision foundation models learned on internet-scale
datasets. The diffusion-based image augmentations allow us to take control over
the semantic distribution of the ground surfaces in the training data and to
fine-tune our model for its deployment environment. We employ open vocabulary
semantic segmentation models to filter out augmentation candidates that contain
hallucinations. We believe that diffusion-based image augmentations can be
extended to many other environments apart from snow surfaces, like sandy
environments and volcanic terrains.

### [12] [FreeLong++: Training-Free Long Video Generation via Multi-band SpectralFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00162)
*Yu Lu,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeLong and FreeLong++ are training-free frameworks for improving long video generation by balancing frequency distribution, outperforming existing methods in temporal consistency and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending short-video generation models to longer videos faces challenges like degraded temporal consistency and high-frequency distortion.

Method: FreeLong blends global low-frequency and local high-frequency features; FreeLong++ extends this with a multi-branch architecture for multi-band frequency fusion.

Result: FreeLong++ improves temporal consistency and visual fidelity for longer videos (4x-8x native length) and supports multi-prompt and controllable generation.

Conclusion: The proposed frameworks effectively address long video generation challenges without additional training, enhancing existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation models have enabled high-quality short
video generation from text prompts. However, extending these models to longer
videos remains a significant challenge, primarily due to degraded temporal
consistency and visual fidelity. Our preliminary observations show that naively
applying short-video generation models to longer sequences leads to noticeable
quality degradation. Further analysis identifies a systematic trend where
high-frequency components become increasingly distorted as video length grows,
an issue we term high-frequency distortion. To address this, we propose
FreeLong, a training-free framework designed to balance the frequency
distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong
achieves this by blending global low-frequency features, which capture holistic
semantics across the full video, with local high-frequency features extracted
from short temporal windows to preserve fine details. Building on this,
FreeLong++ extends FreeLong dual-branch design into a multi-branch architecture
with multiple attention branches, each operating at a distinct temporal scale.
By arranging multiple window sizes from global to local, FreeLong++ enables
multi-band frequency fusion from low to high frequencies, ensuring both
semantic continuity and fine-grained motion dynamics across longer video
sequences. Without any additional training, FreeLong++ can be plugged into
existing video generation models (e.g. Wan2.1 and LTX-Video) to produce longer
videos with substantially improved temporal consistency and visual fidelity. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on longer video
generation tasks (e.g. 4x and 8x of native length). It also supports coherent
multi-prompt video generation with smooth scene transitions and enables
controllable video generation using long depth or pose sequences.

Motivation: Tropical tree crown detection is vital for ecosystem studies but hindered by scarce annotated datasets.

Method: Introduces SelvaBox, a large manually labeled dataset, and benchmarks it with high-resolution inputs and multi-resolution training.

Result: Higher-resolution inputs boost accuracy, and SelvaBox-trained models achieve competitive zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: SelvaBox advances tropical tree crown detection, with public release of dataset, code, and weights.

Abstract: Detecting individual tree crowns in tropical forests is essential to study
these complex and crucial ecosystems impacted by human interventions and
climate change. However, tropical crowns vary widely in size, structure, and
pattern and are largely overlapping and intertwined, requiring advanced remote
sensing methods applied to high-resolution imagery. Despite growing interest in
tropical tree crown detection, annotated datasets remain scarce, hindering
robust model development. We introduce SelvaBox, the largest open-access
dataset for tropical tree crown detection in high-resolution drone imagery. It
spans three countries and contains more than 83,000 manually labeled crowns -
an order of magnitude larger than all previous tropical forest datasets
combined. Extensive benchmarks on SelvaBox reveal two key findings: (1)
higher-resolution inputs consistently boost detection accuracy; and (2) models
trained exclusively on SelvaBox achieve competitive zero-shot detection
performance on unseen tropical tree crown datasets, matching or exceeding
competing methods. Furthermore, jointly training on SelvaBox and three other
datasets at resolutions from 3 to 10 cm per pixel within a unified
multi-resolution pipeline yields a detector ranking first or second across all
evaluated datasets. Our dataset, code, and pre-trained weights are made public.

*J. I. Ruíz,A. Méndez,E. Rodríguez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GNN-based deep learning architecture for segmenting plant components in LiDAR 3D point clouds, outperforming existing methods with over 80% IoU accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like 2D imaging, 3D reconstructions, and CNNs have limitations in processing 3D data and identifying plant components.

Method: Uses GNNs with PCA feature enhancement, KNN for edge establishment, Edge-Conv layers, and GAT for classifying plant components.

Result: Achieves over 80% IoU average, outperforming other point cloud-based models.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based approach improves segmentation accuracy for plant component identification.

Abstract: In precision agriculture, one of the most important tasks when exploring crop
production is identifying individual plant components. There are several
attempts to accomplish this task by the use of traditional 2D imaging, 3D
reconstructions, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However, they have
several drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant
components. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning
architecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and
Ranging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on
the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex
and by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,
thus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used
to further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention
Networks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the
plant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil. This study demonstrates that our
graph-based deep learning approach enhances segmentation accuracy for
identifying individual plant components, achieving percentages above 80% in the
IoU average, thus outperforming other existing models based on point clouds.

*Changsoo Jung,Sheikh Mannan,Jack Fitzgerald,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FiboSB, a challenging 6D pose video dataset for collaborative K-12 tasks, evaluates existing methods, and improves performance by fine-tuning YOLO11-x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems struggle to capture real-world interactions in collaborative educational settings, which 6D pose estimation could address.

Method: The authors create FiboSB, a dataset of group interactions with small objects, test four 6D pose methods, and fine-tune YOLO11-x for better performance.

Result: Current 6D pose methods fail in collaborative contexts; fine-tuned YOLO11-x achieves an mAP_50 of 0.898.

Conclusion: FiboSB and the improved method lay the foundation for better 6D pose estimation in collaborative educational environments.

Abstract: Interactive and spatially aware technologies are transforming educational
frameworks, particularly in K-12 settings where hands-on exploration fosters
deeper conceptual understanding. However, during collaborative tasks, existing
systems often lack the ability to accurately capture real-world interactions
between students and physical objects. This issue could be addressed with
automatic 6D pose estimation, i.e., estimation of an object's position and
orientation in 3D space from RGB images or videos. For collaborative groups
that interact with physical objects, 6D pose estimates allow AI systems to
relate objects and entities. As part of this work, we introduce FiboSB, a novel
and challenging 6D pose video dataset featuring groups of three participants
solving an interactive task featuring small hand-held cubes and a weight scale.
This setup poses unique challenges for 6D pose because groups are holistically
recorded from a distance in order to capture all participants -- this, coupled
with the small size of the cubes, makes 6D pose estimation inherently
non-trivial. We evaluated four state-of-the-art 6D pose estimation methods on
FiboSB, exposing the limitations of current algorithms on collaborative group
work. An error analysis of these methods reveals that the 6D pose methods'
object detection modules fail. We address this by fine-tuning YOLO11-x for
FiboSB, achieving an overall mAP_50 of 0.898. The dataset, benchmark results,
and analysis of YOLO11-x errors presented here lay the groundwork for
leveraging the estimation of 6D poses in difficult collaborative contexts.

*Chi-Yao Huang,Zeel Bhatt,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOCAL introduces a contrastive learning framework for visual odometry, improving interpretability and flexibility by treating VO as a label ranking problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based VO methods rely on rigid geometric assumptions, lacking interpretability and theoretical grounding in data-driven frameworks.

Method: VOCAL integrates Bayesian inference with representation learning, organizing visual features to reflect camera states through a ranking mechanism.

Result: VOCAL shows improved interpretability and flexibility on the KITTI dataset, advancing spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: VOCAL redefines VO with a contrastive learning approach, enhancing interpretability and compatibility with multimodal data.

Abstract: Breakthroughs in visual odometry (VO) have fundamentally reshaped the
landscape of robotics, enabling ultra-precise camera state estimation that is
crucial for modern autonomous systems. Despite these advances, many
learning-based VO techniques rely on rigid geometric assumptions, which often
fall short in interpretability and lack a solid theoretical basis within fully
data-driven frameworks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VOCAL
(Visual Odometry via ContrAstive Learning), a novel framework that reimagines
VO as a label ranking challenge. By integrating Bayesian inference with a
representation learning framework, VOCAL organizes visual features to mirror
camera states. The ranking mechanism compels similar camera states to converge
into consistent and spatially coherent representations within the latent space.
This strategic alignment not only bolsters the interpretability of the learned
features but also ensures compatibility with multimodal data sources. Extensive
evaluations on the KITTI dataset highlight VOCAL's enhanced interpretability
and flexibility, pushing VO toward more general and explainable spatial
intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeTarget360 is a novel system for 360-degree gaze target estimation in images, outperforming prior methods by integrating conditional inference engines and multi-scale fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling robots to understand human gaze targets is crucial for tasks like attention estimation and movement anticipation in human-robot interactions. Prior methods lack effectiveness in out-of-frame scenarios.

Method: The system combines an eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion decoder for conditional inference.

Result: Cross-validation shows GazeTarget360 provides accurate and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios, marking a first-of-its-kind solution.

Conclusion: GazeTarget360 is a highly efficient and deployable system for realistic gaze target prediction, with publicly available source code.

Abstract: Enabling robots to understand human gaze target is a crucial step to allow
capabilities in downstream tasks, for example, attention estimation and
movement anticipation in real-world human-robot interactions. Prior works have
addressed the in-frame target localization problem with data-driven approaches
by carefully removing out-of-frame samples. Vision-based gaze estimation
methods, such as OpenFace, do not effectively absorb background information in
images and cannot predict gaze target in situations where subjects look away
from the camera. In this work, we propose a system to address the problem of
360-degree gaze target estimation from an image in generalized visual scenes.
The system, named GazeTarget360, integrates conditional inference engines of an
eye-contact detector, a pre-trained vision encoder, and a multi-scale-fusion
decoder. Cross validation results show that GazeTarget360 can produce accurate
and reliable gaze target predictions in unseen scenarios. This makes a
first-of-its-kind system to predict gaze targets from realistic camera footage
which is highly efficient and deployable. Our source code is made publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VirtualFencer is a system that extracts 3D fencing motion and strategy from video without supervision, generating realistic fencing behavior for self-play, real fencer interaction, and professional fencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fencing involves diverse motions and strategic responses to opponents, making it ideal for data-driven modeling.

Method: VirtualFencer extracts 3D fencing motion and strategy from unsupervised video data.

Result: The system can fence against itself, real fencers from video, and interactively with professionals.

Conclusion: VirtualFencer effectively models and generates realistic fencing behavior, demonstrating versatility in applications.

Abstract: Fencing is a sport where athletes engage in diverse yet strategically logical
motions. While most motions fall into a few high-level actions (e.g. step,
lunge, parry), the execution can vary widely-fast vs. slow, large vs. small,
offensive vs. defensive. Moreover, a fencer's actions are informed by a
strategy that often comes in response to the opponent's behavior. This
combination of motion diversity with underlying two-player strategy motivates
the application of data-driven modeling to fencing. We present VirtualFencer, a
system capable of extracting 3D fencing motion and strategy from in-the-wild
video without supervision, and then using that extracted knowledge to generate
realistic fencing behavior. We demonstrate the versatile capabilities of our
system by having it (i) fence against itself (self-play), (ii) fence against a
real fencer's motion from online video, and (iii) fence interactively against a
professional fencer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An efficient ML pipeline for organizing VR property images by room type and bed configuration, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The unstructured categorization of VR property images complicates travelers' understanding of spatial layouts and sleeping arrangements.

Method: A pipeline combining supervised room-type detection, overlap detection, clustering, and MLLM for bed type mapping.

Result: Strong performance, surpassing contrastive learning and pretrained embedding methods.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively organizes VR images, aiding travelers in comprehending property layouts and configurations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of vacation rental (VR) platforms has led to an increasing
volume of property images, often uploaded without structured categorization.
This lack of organization poses significant challenges for travelers attempting
to understand the spatial layout of a property, particularly when multiple
rooms of the same type are present. To address this issue, we introduce an
effective approach for solving the room scene discovery and grouping problem,
as well as identifying bed types within each bedroom group. This grouping is
valuable for travelers to comprehend the spatial organization, layout, and the
sleeping configuration of the property. We propose a computationally efficient
machine learning pipeline characterized by low latency and the ability to
perform effectively with sample-efficient learning, making it well-suited for
real-time and data-scarce environments. The pipeline integrates a supervised
room-type detection model, a supervised overlap detection model to identify the
overlap similarity between two images, and a clustering algorithm to group the
images of the same space together using the similarity scores. Additionally,
the pipeline maps each bedroom group to the corresponding bed types specified
in the property's metadata, based on the visual content present in the group's
images using a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) model. We evaluate the
aforementioned models individually and also assess the pipeline in its
entirety, observing strong performance that significantly outperforms
established approaches such as contrastive learning and clustering with
pretrained embeddings.

*Mohamad Dabboussi,Malo Huard,Yann Gousseau,Pietro Gori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised pipeline for multi-view X-ray correspondence improves fracture detection without manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI methods lack robust multi-view correspondence for precise clinical evaluations.

Method: Uses synthetic X-ray views (DRRs) from CT volumes and a transformer-based training phase to predict correspondences.

Result: Improves multi-view fracture classification on both synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Learning synthetic correspondences enhances real-world multi-view fracture detection.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of multi-view radiographs is crucial for diagnosing
fractures, muscular injuries, and other anomalies. While significant advances
have been made in AI-based analysis of single images, current methods often
struggle to establish robust correspondences between different X-ray views, an
essential capability for precise clinical evaluations. In this work, we present
a novel self-supervised pipeline that eliminates the need for manual annotation
by automatically generating a many-to-many correspondence matrix between
synthetic X-ray views. This is achieved using digitally reconstructed
radiographs (DRR), which are automatically derived from unannotated CT volumes.
Our approach incorporates a transformer-based training phase to accurately
predict correspondences across two or more X-ray views. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that learning correspondences among synthetic X-ray views can be
leveraged as a pretraining strategy to enhance automatic multi-view fracture
detection on real data. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real X-ray
datasets show that incorporating correspondences improves performance in
multi-view fracture classification.

*Ali Mammadov,Loïc Le Folgoc,Guillaume Hocquet,Pietro Gori*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy to reduce performance variability in Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods for WSI classification, improving reproducibility and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High variability in MIL methods for WSI classification (10-15 AUC points) due to weight initialization, batch ordering, and learning rate makes reliable comparison difficult.

Method: Train multiple models for a few epochs, average the most stable ones based on validation scores, and apply this fusion strategy to existing MIL models.

Result: Validated on 2 datasets, 3 initialization strategies, and 5 MIL methods (2000+ experiments), showing reduced variability and improved reproducibility.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively reduces performance variability in MIL methods, simplifies hyperparameter tuning, and maintains computational efficiency.

Abstract: Digital pathology has revolutionized the field by enabling the digitization
of tissue samples into whole slide images (WSIs). However, the high resolution
and large size of WSIs present significant challenges when it comes to applying
Deep Learning models. As a solution, WSIs are often divided into smaller
patches with a global label (\textit{i.e., diagnostic}) per slide, instead of a
(too) costly pixel-wise annotation. By treating each slide as a bag of patches,
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods have emerged as a suitable solution
for WSI classification. A major drawback of MIL methods is their high
variability in performance across different runs, which can reach up to 10-15
AUC points on the test set, making it difficult to compare different MIL
methods reliably. This variability mainly comes from three factors: i) weight
initialization, ii) batch (shuffling) ordering, iii) and learning rate. To
address that, we introduce a Multi-Fidelity, Model Fusion strategy for MIL
methods. We first train multiple models for a few epochs and average the most
stable and promising ones based on validation scores. This approach can be
applied to any existing MIL model to reduce performance variability. It also
simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves reproducibility while maintaining
computational efficiency. We extensively validate our approach on WSI
classification tasks using 2 different datasets, 3 initialization strategies
and 5 MIL methods, for a total of more than 2000 experiments.

*Chuyan Zhang,Kefan Wang,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SR-LoRA improves LoRA by using stable rank for efficient rank allocation, outperforming adaptive LoRA variants in domain-gap tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed low-rank structure in LoRA limits adaptability in domain-gap scenarios, and current adaptive methods are computationally expensive.

Method: SR-LoRA leverages stable rank of pre-trained weights for layer-wise rank allocation, avoiding costly searches.

Result: SR-LoRA outperforms adaptive LoRA variants in few-shot tasks with domain gaps, balancing performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: SR-LoRA provides a principled, efficient solution for rank allocation in LoRA, enhancing adaptability without extra costs.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven effective in reducing computational
costs while maintaining performance comparable to fully fine-tuned foundation
models across various tasks. However, its fixed low-rank structure restricts
its adaptability in scenarios with substantial domain gaps, where higher ranks
are often required to capture domain-specific complexities. Current adaptive
LoRA methods attempt to overcome this limitation by dynamically expanding or
selectively allocating ranks, but these approaches frequently depend on
computationally intensive techniques such as iterative pruning, rank searches,
or additional regularization. To address these challenges, we introduce Stable
Rank-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (SR-LoRA), a novel framework that utilizes the
stable rank of pre-trained weight matrices as a natural prior for layer-wise
rank allocation. By leveraging the stable rank, which reflects the intrinsic
dimensionality of the weights, SR-LoRA enables a principled and efficient
redistribution of ranks across layers, enhancing adaptability without incurring
additional search costs. Empirical evaluations on few-shot tasks with
significant domain gaps show that SR-LoRA consistently outperforms recent
adaptive LoRA variants, achieving a superior trade-off between performance and
efficiency. Our code is available at

Result: Achieves 0.455 average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baselines by 8%.

Conclusion: MammoTracker enhances CAD-based lesion progression analysis; the dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate lesion tracking in temporal mammograms is essential for monitoring
breast cancer progression and facilitating early diagnosis. However, automated
lesion correspondence across exams remains a challenges in computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) systems, limiting their effectiveness. We propose MammoTracker,
a mask-guided lesion tracking framework that automates lesion localization
across consecutively exams. Our approach follows a coarse-to-fine strategy
incorporating three key modules: global search, local search, and score
refinement. To support large-scale training and evaluation, we introduce a new
dataset with curated prior-exam annotations for 730 mass and calcification
cases from the public EMBED mammogram dataset, yielding over 20000 lesion
pairs, making it the largest known resource for temporal lesion tracking in
mammograms. Experimental results demonstrate that MammoTracker achieves 0.455
average overlap and 0.509 accuracy, surpassing baseline models by 8%,
highlighting its potential to enhance CAD-based lesion progression analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether text-to-video models can inherently perceive affordances (how humans interact with environments) and generate coherent human behavior in scenes.

Method: Fine-tune a text-to-video model to insert a person into a scene based on a prompt, ensuring behavior, appearance, and scene affordance coherence. Uses cross-attention heatmaps to infer affordances without labeled data.

Result: Demonstrates that pre-trained video models can uncover affordance perception without explicit labels, enabling coherent human-scene interactions.

Conclusion: Video generation models can be repurposed as interactive world simulators, leveraging inherent affordance perception for realistic human-environment interactions.

Abstract: Can a video generation model be repurposed as an interactive world simulator?
We explore the affordance perception potential of text-to-video models by
teaching them to predict human-environment interaction. Given a scene image and
a prompt describing human actions, we fine-tune the model to insert a person
into the scene, while ensuring coherent behavior, appearance, harmonization,
and scene affordance. Unlike prior work, we infer human affordance for video
generation (i.e., where to insert a person and how they should behave) from a
single scene image, without explicit conditions like bounding boxes or body
poses. An in-depth study of cross-attention heatmaps demonstrates that we can
uncover the inherent affordance perception of a pre-trained video model without
labeled affordance datasets.

TL;DR: MOVi-MC-AC is a new dataset for amodal segmentation and content completion, featuring multi-camera views and ground-truth amodal content labels for 5.8M object instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack multi-camera context and ground-truth amodal content, limiting progress in occluded object understanding.

Method: Simulates cluttered household scenes with multi-camera video, providing consistent object IDs and amodal labels across frames and cameras.

Result: Largest amodal dataset with 5.8M instances, first to include ground-truth amodal content, and introduces multi-camera tracking.

Conclusion: MOVi-MC-AC advances computer vision by addressing gaps in multi-camera tracking and amodal content reconstruction.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation and amodal content completion require using object priors
to estimate occluded masks and features of objects in complex scenes. Until
now, no data has provided an additional dimension for object context: the
possibility of multiple cameras sharing a view of a scene. We introduce
MOVi-MC-AC: Multiple Object Video with Multi-Cameras and Amodal Content, the
largest amodal segmentation and first amodal content dataset to date. Cluttered
scenes of generic household objects are simulated in multi-camera video.
MOVi-MC-AC contributes to the growing literature of object detection, tracking,
and segmentation by including two new contributions to the deep learning for
computer vision world. Multiple Camera (MC) settings where objects can be
identified and tracked between various unique camera perspectives are rare in
both synthetic and real-world video. We introduce a new complexity to synthetic
video by providing consistent object ids for detections and segmentations
between both frames and multiple cameras each with unique features and motion
patterns on a single scene. Amodal Content (AC) is a reconstructive task in
which models predict the appearance of target objects through occlusions. In
the amodal segmentation literature, some datasets have been released with
amodal detection, tracking, and segmentation labels. While other methods rely
on slow cut-and-paste schemes to generate amodal content pseudo-labels, they do
not account for natural occlusions present in the modal masks. MOVi-MC-AC
provides labels for ~5.8 million object instances, setting a new maximum in the
amodal dataset literature, along with being the first to provide ground-truth
amodal content. The full dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CGEarthEye, a high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation model (RSVFM) for the Jilin-1 satellite, leveraging a 15-million-scale SSL dataset (JLSSD) and achieving SOTA performance across 10 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited access to ultra-high-resolution RS imagery hinders RSVFM progress. The Jilin-1 constellation's abundant sub-meter-level data offers an opportunity to address this gap.

Method: Proposes CGEarthEye, a 2.1-billion-parameter RSVFM framework with five backbones, using multi-temporal SSL (JLSSD) and contrastive strategies (seasonal, augmentation, masked patch token).

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on 10 benchmark datasets across four RS tasks, with superior feature visualization, convergence, efficiency, and practical mapping.

Conclusion: CGEarthEye's capabilities can enhance Jilin-1 data applications in Earth Observation, bridging the gap in high-resolution RSVFM development.

Abstract: Deep learning methods have significantly advanced the development of
intelligent rinterpretation in remote sensing (RS), with foundational model
research based on large-scale pre-training paradigms rapidly reshaping various
domains of Earth Observation (EO). However, compared to the open accessibility
and high spatiotemporal coverage of medium-resolution data, the limited
acquisition channels for ultra-high-resolution optical RS imagery have
constrained the progress of high-resolution remote sensing vision foundation
models (RSVFM). As the world's largest sub-meter-level commercial RS satellite
constellation, the Jilin-1 constellation possesses abundant sub-meter-level
image resources. This study proposes CGEarthEye, a RSVFM framework specifically
designed for Jilin-1 satellite characteristics, comprising five backbones with
different parameter scales with totaling 2.1 billion parameters. To enhance the
representational capacity of the foundation model, we developed JLSSD, the
first 15-million-scale multi-temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) dataset
featuring global coverage with quarterly temporal sampling within a single
year, constructed through multi-level representation clustering and sampling
strategies. The framework integrates seasonal contrast, augmentation-based
contrast, and masked patch token contrastive strategies for pre-training.
Comprehensive evaluations across 10 benchmark datasets covering four typical RS
tasks demonstrate that the CGEarthEye consistently achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. Further analysis reveals CGEarthEye's superior
characteristics in feature visualization, model convergence, parameter
efficiency, and practical mapping applications. This study anticipates that the
exceptional representation capabilities of CGEarthEye will facilitate broader
and more efficient applications of Jilin-1 data in traditional EO application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS struggles with initialization, optimization of unstructured Gaussians, and lacks adaptive density control, limiting its effectiveness in complex scenes.

Abstract: We propose a method to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)~\cite{Kerbl2023},
addressing challenges in initialization, optimization, and density control.
Gaussian Splatting is an alternative for rendering realistic images while
supporting real-time performance, and it has gained popularity due to its
explicit 3D Gaussian representation. However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate
initialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian
distributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control
mechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided
initialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and
faster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy
to refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with
the surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive
density control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional
complexity, for visual fidelity. These innovations enable our method to achieve
high-fidelity real-time rendering and significant improvements in visual
quality, even in complex scenes. Our method demonstrates comparable or superior
results to state-of-the-art methods, rendering high-fidelity images in real
time.

*Wanghui Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study proposes an improved U-net model for denoising offline handwriting signatures, enhancing clarity and recognition robustness using wavelet and PCA transforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwriting signatures are crucial for identity recognition but often contain noise from historical documents, complicating forensic analysis.

Method: The study introduces a denoising model based on an improved U-net structure, incorporating discrete wavelet transform and PCA transform to suppress noise.

Result: The model outperforms traditional methods, improving signature image clarity and readability for better recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed model provides reliable technical support for signature analysis, enhancing forensic and recognition applications.

Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are
widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial
contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In
forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures
requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which
are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials.
However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount
of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting
identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising
model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness
of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform
and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The
experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the
traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity
and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical
support for signature analysis and recognition.

*Hikaru Shijo,Yutaka Yoshihama,Kenichi Yadani,Norifumi Murata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATLI improves OOD detection by adaptively combining top-k logits, reducing FPR95 by 6.73% over MaxLogit and 2.67% over other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks often overconfidently predict OOD samples, risking safety. Better OOD detection is needed.

Method: Proposes ATLI, which adaptively selects and combines top-k logits for OOD scoring, enhancing MaxLogit.

Result: ATLI reduces FPR95 by 6.73% vs. MaxLogit and 2.67% vs. other methods on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: ATLI effectively improves OOD detection by leveraging adaptive logit integration.

Abstract: Neural networks often make overconfident predictions from out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples. Detection of OOD data is therefore crucial to improve the safety
of machine learning. The simplest and most powerful method for OOD detection is
MaxLogit, which uses the model's maximum logit to provide an OOD score. We have
discovered that, in addition to the maximum logit, some other logits are also
useful for OOD detection. Based on this finding, we propose a new method called
ATLI (Adaptive Top-k Logits Integration), which adaptively determines effective
top-k logits that are specific to each model and combines the maximum logit
with the other top-k logits. In this study we evaluate our proposed method
using ImageNet-1K benchmark. Extensive experiments showed our proposed method
to reduce the false positive rate (FPR95) by 6.73% compared to the MaxLogit
approach, and decreased FPR95 by an additional 2.67% compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

*Xin Yang,Ruiming Du,Hanyang Huang,Jiayang Xie,Pengyao Xie,Leisen Fang,Ziyue Guo,Nanjun Jiang,Yu Jiang,Haiyan Cen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlantSegNeRF, a novel approach for high-precision plant organ segmentation from multi-view RGB images, outperforms existing methods in accuracy and generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing plant point cloud segmentation techniques lack resolution, accuracy, and generalizability across species.

Method: PlantSegNeRF uses 2D instance segmentation, instance matching, and implicit scene rendering (NeRF) to generate high-precision instance point clouds.

Result: Outperforms common methods by 16.1-24.2% in semantic segmentation metrics and shows significant improvements in instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: PlantSegNeRF advances organ-level phenotyping and provides high-quality 3D data for large-scale plant models.

Abstract: Organ segmentation of plant point clouds is a prerequisite for the
high-resolution and accurate extraction of organ-level phenotypic traits.
Although the fast development of deep learning has boosted much research on
segmentation of plant point clouds, the existing techniques for organ
segmentation still face limitations in resolution, segmentation accuracy, and
generalizability across various plant species. In this study, we proposed a
novel approach called plant segmentation neural radiance fields (PlantSegNeRF),
aiming to directly generate high-precision instance point clouds from
multi-view RGB image sequences for a wide range of plant species. PlantSegNeRF
performed 2D instance segmentation on the multi-view images to generate
instance masks for each organ with a corresponding ID. The multi-view instance
IDs corresponding to the same plant organ were then matched and refined using a
specially designed instance matching module. The instance NeRF was developed to
render an implicit scene, containing color, density, semantic and instance
information. The implicit scene was ultimately converted into high-precision
plant instance point clouds based on the volume density. The results proved
that in semantic segmentation of point clouds, PlantSegNeRF outperformed the
commonly used methods, demonstrating an average improvement of 16.1%, 18.3%,
17.8%, and 24.2% in precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU compared to the
second-best results on structurally complex datasets. More importantly,
PlantSegNeRF exhibited significant advantages in plant point cloud instance
segmentation tasks. Across all plant datasets, it achieved average improvements
of 11.7%, 38.2%, 32.2% and 25.3% in mPrec, mRec, mCov, mWCov, respectively.
This study extends the organ-level plant phenotyping and provides a
high-throughput way to supply high-quality 3D data for the development of
large-scale models in plant science.

*Xinge Yang,Chuong Nguyen,Wenbin Wang,Kaizhang Kang,Wolfgang Heidrich,Xiaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a scalable dataset synthesis method for addressing defocus and optical aberrations in fixed-focus cameras, enabling effective generalization to real-world images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of shallow depth of field in fixed-focus cameras and domain gaps in deep learning models trained on open-source datasets.

Method: Efficient dataset synthesis modeling depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations without real-world fine-tuning.

Result: Network trained on low-res synthetic images generalizes well to high-res (12MP) real-world images.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the domain gap and addresses computational complexity and dataset scarcity.

Abstract: Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of
field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This
limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those
used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to
form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and
defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained
on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well
in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable
dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world
data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially
varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the
scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes
effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.

*Ian Jin,Fanxin Xia,Feng Ding,Xinfeng Zhang,Meiqin Liu,Yao Zhao,Weisi Lin,Lili Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A customizable ROI-based deep image compression method is proposed, allowing users to define ROI via text and manage quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ROI-based compression lacks flexibility for diverse user preferences in defining ROI and balancing quality between ROI and non-ROI.

Method: Introduces Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA), Customizable Value Assign (CVA), and Latent Mask Attention (LMA) modules for flexible ROI customization and quality management.

Result: The method effectively supports customizable ROI definition and quality trade-offs, outperforming existing schemes.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm successfully addresses the need for customizable and flexible ROI-based image compression.

Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by
prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users
(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,
ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various
preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require
different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image
compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack
effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.
This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image
compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,
which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just
inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder
controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)
mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users
instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off
between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)
module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent
Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused
in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of
the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses
the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as
the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

TL;DR: MedDiff-FT is a controllable medical image generation method that fine-tunes diffusion models for data-efficient, high-quality synthetic medical images, improving segmentation performance by 1% Dice score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of deep learning in medical image segmentation due to scarce high-quality training data and diffusion models' reliance on large datasets.

Method: Fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model with a dynamic adaptive guiding mask, stochastic mask generator, and automated quality assessment for anatomically coherent and diverse synthetic images.

Result: Improves segmentation performance by 1% Dice score on five datasets, balancing quality, diversity, and efficiency.

Conclusion: MedDiff-FT offers a practical solution for medical data augmentation, enhancing segmentation with synthetic images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning for medical image segmentation are often
limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data.While diffusion models
provide a potential solution by generating synthetic images, their
effectiveness in medical imaging remains constrained due to their reliance on
large-scale medical datasets and the need for higher image quality. To address
these challenges, we present MedDiff-FT, a controllable medical image
generation method that fine-tunes a diffusion foundation model to produce
medical images with structural dependency and domain specificity in a
data-efficient manner. During inference, a dynamic adaptive guiding mask
enforces spatial constraints to ensure anatomically coherent synthesis, while a
lightweight stochastic mask generator enhances diversity through hierarchical
randomness injection. Additionally, an automated quality assessment protocol
filters suboptimal outputs using feature-space metrics, followed by mask
corrosion to refine fidelity. Evaluated on five medical segmentation
datasets,MedDiff-FT's synthetic image-mask pairs improve SOTA method's
segmentation performance by an average of 1% in Dice score. The framework
effectively balances generation quality, diversity, and computational
efficiency, offering a practical solution for medical data augmentation. The

*Yingping Liang,Yutao Hu,Wenqi Shao,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Lift to Match (L2M), a two-stage framework for robust feature matching by lifting 2D images to 3D space, leveraging large-scale single-view images and synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature matching methods rely on clean multi-view images, limiting generalization. Conventional encoders trained on 2D images lack 3D awareness.

Method: L2M uses a 3D-aware feature encoder (multi-view synthesis + 3D Gaussian representation) and a feature decoder (novel-view rendering + synthetic data).

Result: The method achieves superior generalization in zero-shot benchmarks, proving robust feature matching across diverse domains.

Conclusion: L2M effectively addresses limitations of current methods by integrating 3D geometry and synthetic data, enhancing feature matching robustness.

Abstract: Feature matching plays a fundamental role in many computer vision tasks, yet
existing methods heavily rely on scarce and clean multi-view image collections,
which constrains their generalization to diverse and challenging scenarios.
Moreover, conventional feature encoders are typically trained on single-view 2D
images, limiting their capacity to capture 3D-aware correspondences. In this
paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that lifts 2D images to 3D space,
named as \textbf{Lift to Match (L2M)}, taking full advantage of large-scale and
diverse single-view images. To be specific, in the first stage, we learn a
3D-aware feature encoder using a combination of multi-view image synthesis and
3D feature Gaussian representation, which injects 3D geometry knowledge into
the encoder. In the second stage, a novel-view rendering strategy, combined
with large-scale synthetic data generation from single-view images, is employed
to learn a feature decoder for robust feature matching, thus achieving
generalization across diverse domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method achieves superior generalization across zero-shot evaluation
benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robust
feature matching.

*Xin Xu,Eibe Frank,Geoffrey Holmes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'MIV-head' for cross-domain few-shot learning without fine-tuning backbones, achieving competitive accuracy with lower adaptation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of few-shot learning when fine-tuning backbones is impractical, focusing on static embeddings from frozen backbones.

Method: Proposes the MIV-head, a backbone-agnostic classification head, trained on few-shot target domain data for efficient meta-testing.

Result: MIV-head outperforms adapter methods and traditional classification heads in accuracy while reducing adaptation costs.

Conclusion: The MIV-head is a practical solution for cross-domain few-shot learning, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: We investigate cross-domain few-shot learning under the constraint that
fine-tuning of backbones (i.e., feature extractors) is impossible or infeasible
-- a scenario that is increasingly common in practical use cases. Handling the
low-quality and static embeddings produced by frozen, "black-box" backbones
leads to a problem representation of few-shot classification as a series of
multiple instance verification (MIV) tasks. Inspired by this representation, we
introduce a novel approach to few-shot domain adaptation, named the "MIV-head",
akin to a classification head that is agnostic to any pretrained backbone and
computationally efficient. The core components designed for the MIV-head, when
trained on few-shot data from a target domain, collectively yield strong
performance on test data from that domain. Importantly, it does so without
fine-tuning the backbone, and within the "meta-testing" phase. Experimenting
under various settings and on an extension of the Meta-dataset benchmark for
cross-domain few-shot image classification, using representative off-the-shelf
convolutional neural network and vision transformer backbones pretrained on
ImageNet1K, we show that the MIV-head achieves highly competitive accuracy when
compared to state-of-the-art "adapter" (or partially fine-tuning) methods
applied to the same backbones, while incurring substantially lower adaptation
cost. We also find well-known "classification head" approaches lag far behind
in terms of accuracy. Ablation study empirically justifies the core components
of our approach. We share our code at https://github.com/xxweka/MIV-head.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiGA3D is a unified 3D inpainting pipeline using diffusion models to address appearance and geometry inconsistencies, improving robustness and consistency across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in 3D inpainting include lack of robustness in single-reference methods, appearance inconsistency in multi-view images, and geometry inconsistency during significant changes.

Method: DiGA3D uses multiple reference views, an Attention Feature Propagation mechanism, and a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling loss for coarse-to-fine consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show DiGA3D's effectiveness in handling multiple 3D inpainting tasks.

Conclusion: DiGA3D provides a versatile and robust solution for 3D inpainting, addressing key challenges with diffusion models.

Abstract: Developing a unified pipeline that enables users to remove, re-texture, or
replace objects in a versatile manner is crucial for text-guided 3D inpainting.
However, there are still challenges in performing multiple 3D inpainting tasks
within a unified framework: 1) Single reference inpainting methods lack
robustness when dealing with views that are far from the reference view. 2)
Appearance inconsistency arises when independently inpainting multi-view images
with 2D diffusion priors; 3) Geometry inconsistency limits performance when
there are significant geometric changes in the inpainting regions. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce DiGA3D, a novel and versatile 3D inpainting
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to propagate consistent appearance and
geometry in a coarse-to-fine manner. First, DiGA3D develops a robust strategy
for selecting multiple reference views to reduce errors during propagation.
Next, DiGA3D designs an Attention Feature Propagation (AFP) mechanism that
propagates attention features from the selected reference views to other views
via diffusion models to maintain appearance consistency. Furthermore, DiGA3D
introduces a Texture-Geometry Score Distillation Sampling (TG-SDS) loss to
further improve the geometric consistency of inpainted 3D scenes. Extensive
experiments on multiple 3D inpainting tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. The project page is available at https://rorisis.github.io/DiGA3D/.

Motivation: HMER struggles with complex formula structures and layouts; frequency domain analysis is introduced to enhance structural recognition.

Method: Incorporates discrete cosine transform (DCT) into HMER, marrying frequency domain with sequence prediction.

Result: MFH-CoMER achieves accuracy rates of 61.66%/62.07%/63.72% on CROHME 2014/2016/2019 test sets.

Conclusion: Frequency domain information effectively enhances HMER performance, as demonstrated by consistent improvements across baseline models.

Abstract: Handwritten mathematical expression recognition (HMER) suffers from complex
formula structures and character layouts in sequence prediction. In this paper,
we incorporate frequency domain analysis into HMER and propose a method that
marries frequency domain with HMER (MFH), leveraging the discrete cosine

demonstrating the efficacy of frequency domain information. Experiments show
that our MFH-CoMER achieves noteworthy accuracyrates of 61.66%/62.07%/63.72% on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent-PMRF improves face restoration by reformulating PMRF in VAE latent space, aligning better with human perception and achieving faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of PMRF's pixel-space modeling in aligning with human perception for face restoration.

Method: Reformulate PMRF in VAE latent space, using latent representations for minimum distortion estimation and bounding distortion by VAE reconstruction error.

Result: Latent-PMRF outperforms PMRF with a 5.79X speedup in FID and better perceptual-distortion tradeoff.

Conclusion: Latent-PMRF offers superior face restoration by leveraging latent space and optimized VAE design.

Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face
restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve
minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean
Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution
is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its
pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human
perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between
two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which
reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE),
facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By
defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum
distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's
reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our
proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and
restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the
superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to
existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a
5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as
open-source.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATSTrack addresses misalignment in Visual-Language Tracking by aligning temporal and spatial scales of visual and language inputs, improving feature modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The misalignment between visual inputs and language descriptions due to target movement and inherent differences in temporal/spatial scales hinders tracking performance.

Method: Decomposes language descriptions into phrases with attributes matching visual inputs, modifies features finely, and uses a Visual-Language token from the previous frame to guide feature extraction.

Result: ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces misalignment and enhances tracking by addressing scale differences.

Abstract: A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment
between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement.
Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to
preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor
ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the
temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs.
To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances
the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and
\textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as
\textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into
phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial
correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained
manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified
linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract
visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby
reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental
results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to
existing methods. Our code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods for VLMs like CLIP overlook low-confidence samples and operate within CLIP's original feature space, limiting adaptation.

Method: Proposes MS-TTA, a training-free approach using kNN Mean-Shift to refine test samples, enhancing feature compactness and class separability.

Result: MS-TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art training-free TTA methods on OOD and cross-dataset benchmarks.

Conclusion: MS-TTA achieves robust test-time adaptation without additional training, leveraging refined embeddings for improved performance.

Abstract: Visual-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong generalization but
struggle with distribution shifts at test time. Existing training-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) methods operate strictly within CLIP's original
feature space, relying on high-confidence samples while overlooking the
potential of low-confidence ones. We propose MS-TTA, a training-free approach
that enhances feature representations beyond CLIP's space using a single-step
k-nearest neighbors (kNN) Mean-Shift. By refining all test samples, MS-TTA
improves feature compactness and class separability, leading to more stable
adaptation. Additionally, a cache of refined embeddings further enhances
inference by providing Mean Shift enhanced logits. Extensive evaluations on OOD
and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that MS-TTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free TTA methods, achieving robust adaptation without
requiring additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bisecle is a novel method for video-language continual learning, inspired by hippocampal memory mechanisms, addressing catastrophic forgetting and update conflict in VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos evolve continuously, requiring VLMs to adapt without prohibitive computational costs, while avoiding forgetting and conflicts.

Method: Uses multi-directional supervision for cross-modal relationships and contrastive prompt learning to isolate task-specific knowledge.

Result: Bisecle mitigates forgetting and improves cross-task generalization on VideoQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Bisecle enables robust and efficient continual learning in video understanding by mimicking hippocampal memory processes.

Abstract: Frontier vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable improvements in
video understanding tasks. However, real-world videos typically exist as
continuously evolving data streams (e.g., dynamic scenes captured by wearable
glasses), necessitating models to continually adapt to shifting data
distributions and novel scenarios. Considering the prohibitive computational
costs of fine-tuning models on new tasks, usually, a small subset of parameters
is updated while the bulk of the model remains frozen. This poses new
challenges to existing continual learning frameworks in the context of large
multimodal foundation models, i.e., catastrophic forgetting and update
conflict. While the foundation models struggle with parameter-efficient
continual learning, the hippocampus in the human brain has evolved highly
efficient mechanisms for memory formation and consolidation. Inspired by the
rapid Binding and pattern separation mechanisms in the hippocampus, in this
work, we propose Bisecle for video-language continual learning, where a
multi-directional supervision module is used to capture more cross-modal
relationships and a contrastive prompt learning scheme is designed to isolate
task-specific knowledge to facilitate efficient memory storage. Binding and
separation processes further strengthen the ability of VLMs to retain complex
experiences, enabling robust and efficient continual learning in video
understanding tasks. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed Bisecle,
demonstrating its ability to mitigate forgetting and enhance cross-task
generalization on several VideoQA benchmarks.

*Ying Guo,Xi Liu,Cheng Zhen,Pengfei Yan,Xiaoming Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ARIG, an autoregressive frame-wise framework for real-time interactive head generation, addressing limitations of clip-wise methods by using diffusion-based motion prediction and emphasizing interactive and conversational state understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face-to-face communication drives the need for realistic virtual agents. Current methods struggle with real-time performance and realism due to signal acquisition, contextual understanding, and smooth switching issues.

Method: ARIG uses a non-vector-quantized autoregressive process with diffusion-based motion prediction. It incorporates interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and conversational state understanding (CSU) for realism.

Result: Experiments confirm ARIG's effectiveness in achieving real-time generation and improved interaction realism.

Conclusion: ARIG advances interactive head generation by combining autoregressive modeling, diffusion-based prediction, and deep contextual understanding.

Abstract: Face-to-face communication, as a common human activity, motivates the
research on interactive head generation. A virtual agent can generate motion
responses with both listening and speaking capabilities based on the audio or
motion signals of the other user and itself. However, previous clip-wise
generation paradigm or explicit listener/speaker generator-switching methods
have limitations in future signal acquisition, contextual behavioral
understanding, and switching smoothness, making it challenging to be real-time
and realistic. In this paper, we propose an autoregressive (AR) based
frame-wise framework called ARIG to realize the real-time generation with
better interaction realism. To achieve real-time generation, we model motion
prediction as a non-vector-quantized AR process. Unlike discrete codebook-index
prediction, we represent motion distribution using diffusion procedure,
achieving more accurate predictions in continuous space. To improve interaction
realism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed
conversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track
dual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through
bidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over
long ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU
to understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that
exist in actual conversations. These serve as conditions for the final
progressive motion prediction. Extensive experiments have verified the
effectiveness of our model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ADAptation, an unsupervised Active Learning framework for domain adaptation, using diffusion models and dual-scoring to handle distribution shifts in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance drops in deep learning models due to distribution shifts between training and test domains, reducing annotation costs.

Method: Uses diffusion models for domain homogenization, hypersphere-constrained contrastive learning, and dual-scoring for sample selection.

Result: Outperforms existing AL methods on breast ultrasound datasets across five classifiers.

Conclusion: ADAptation is effective for clinical domain adaptation with limited annotation budgets.

Abstract: Deep learning-based diagnostic models often suffer performance drops due to
distribution shifts between training (source) and test (target) domains.
Collecting and labeling sufficient target domain data for model retraining
represents an optimal solution, yet is limited by time and scarce resources.
Active learning (AL) offers an efficient approach to reduce annotation costs
while maintaining performance, but struggles to handle the challenge posed by
distribution variations across different datasets. In this study, we propose a
novel unsupervised Active learning framework for Domain Adaptation, named
ADAptation, which efficiently selects informative samples from multi-domain
data pools under limited annotation budget. As a fundamental step, our method
first utilizes the distribution homogenization capabilities of diffusion models
to bridge cross-dataset gaps by translating target images into source-domain
style. We then introduce two key innovations: (a) a hypersphere-constrained
contrastive learning network for compact feature clustering, and (b) a
dual-scoring mechanism that quantifies and balances sample uncertainty and
representativeness. Extensive experiments on four breast ultrasound datasets
(three public and one in-house/multi-center) across five common deep
classifiers demonstrate that our method surpasses existing strong AL-based
competitors, validating its effectiveness and generalization for clinical
domain adaptation. The code is available at the anonymized link:

*Zijian Chen,Yuan Tian,Yuze Sun,Wei Sun,Zicheng Zhang,Weisi Lin,Guangtao Zhai,Wenjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LMM-JND, a concept to quantify visual blind spots in large multimodal models (LMMs), and presents VPA-JND, a dataset to study these limitations. It highlights gaps in LMMs' visual perception compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic exploration of perceptual boundaries in LMMs and uncover their visual blind spots, which pose security and efficiency risks.

Method: Proposes LMM-JND and its pipeline, constructs the VPA-JND dataset with 21.5k images and 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, and evaluates LMMs like GPT-4o and InternVL2.5.

Result: Reveals significant visual blind spots in LMMs, showing they struggle with basic comparison tasks and lag behind human performance.

Conclusion: LMM-JND is a valuable metric for studying LMMs, and improving visual acuity in LMMs is crucial for security and performance.

Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual
system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work
has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a
scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across
multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly
advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted
capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual
defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential
security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an
initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots
in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new
concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting
uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks,
we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named
VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12
distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where
state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle
with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level
visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language
backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that
may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together,
our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective
for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

### [46] [Visual Anagrams Reveal Hidden Differences in Holistic Shape Processing Across Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00493)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Configural Shape Score (CSS) to evaluate models' absolute configural competence, showing top performance in self-supervised and language-aligned transformers like DINOv2 and SigLIP2. High-CSS models rely on long-range interactions, and CSS predicts shape-dependent evaluations, advocating for integrating both texture and shape cues in vision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness of contemporary vision models that overly rely on local texture cues, ignoring the importance of global configural shape, and to move beyond the shape-vs-texture bias by evaluating absolute configural competence.

Method: Proposes the Configural Shape Score (CSS) to measure models' ability to recognize objects in Object-Anagram pairs, which permute global part arrangements while preserving local texture. Tests 86 models, including convolutional, transformer, and hybrid architectures.

Result: Fully self-supervised and language-aligned transformers (e.g., DINOv2, SigLIP2, EVA-CLIP) perform best on CSS. High-CSS models depend on long-range interactions, with mechanistic probes revealing a mid-depth transition from local to global coding. BagNet control confirms no 'border-hacking' strategies.

Conclusion: Robust, human-like vision systems require integrating both local-texture and global configural shape cues, rather than forcing a choice between them. CSS serves as a valuable metric for evaluating such integration.

Abstract: Humans are able to recognize objects based on both local texture cues and the
configuration of object parts, yet contemporary vision models primarily harvest
local texture cues, yielding brittle, non-compositional features. Work on
shape-vs-texture bias has pitted shape and texture representations in
opposition, measuring shape relative to texture, ignoring the possibility that
models (and humans) can simultaneously rely on both types of cues, and
obscuring the absolute quality of both types of representation. We therefore
recast shape evaluation as a matter of absolute configural competence,
operationalized by the Configural Shape Score (CSS), which (i) measures the
ability to recognize both images in Object-Anagram pairs that preserve local
texture while permuting global part arrangement to depict different object
categories. Across 86 convolutional, transformer, and hybrid models, CSS (ii)
uncovers a broad spectrum of configural sensitivity with fully self-supervised
and language-aligned transformers -- exemplified by DINOv2, SigLIP2 and
EVA-CLIP -- occupying the top end of the CSS spectrum. Mechanistic probes
reveal that (iii) high-CSS networks depend on long-range interactions:
radius-controlled attention masks abolish performance showing a distinctive
U-shaped integration profile, and representational-similarity analyses expose a
mid-depth transition from local to global coding. A BagNet control remains at
chance (iv), ruling out "border-hacking" strategies. Finally, (v) we show that
configural shape score also predicts other shape-dependent evals. Overall, we
propose that the path toward truly robust, generalizable, and human-like vision
systems may not lie in forcing an artificial choice between shape and texture,
but rather in architectural and learning frameworks that seamlessly integrate
both local-texture and global configural shape.

*Yongzhen Wang,Liangliang Chen,Bingwen Hu,Heng Liu,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Laplace-Mamba integrates Laplace frequency prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSM-based approaches struggle with localized structures and high-dimensional data, leading to poor recovery of fine image features.

Method: Uses Laplace decomposition to split the image into low-frequency (global texture) and high-frequency (edges/details) components, processed via dual pathways: SSMs for global context and CNNs for local details.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration quality and efficiency, validated across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Laplace-Mamba effectively addresses SSM limitations, offering superior performance in image dehazing.

Abstract: Recent progress in image restoration has underscored Spatial State Models
(SSMs) as powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies, owing to their
appealing linear complexity and computational efficiency. However, SSM-based
approaches exhibit limitations in reconstructing localized structures and tend
to be less effective when handling high-dimensional data, frequently resulting
in suboptimal recovery of fine image features. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce Laplace-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Laplace frequency
prior with a hybrid Mamba-CNN architecture for efficient image dehazing.
Leveraging the Laplace decomposition, the image is disentangled into
low-frequency components capturing global texture and high-frequency components
representing edges and fine details. This decomposition enables specialized
processing via dual parallel pathways: the low-frequency branch employs SSMs
for global context modeling, while the high-frequency branch utilizes CNNs to
refine local structural details, effectively addressing diverse haze scenarios.
Notably, the Laplace transformation facilitates information-preserving
downsampling of low-frequency components in accordance with the Nyquist theory,
thereby significantly improving computational efficiency. Extensive evaluations
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency. The

TL;DR: ExPaMoE introduces an expandable parallel Mixture-of-Experts framework for continual test-time adaptation, addressing feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting by dynamically adapting to domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTTA methods struggle with feature entanglement and catastrophic forgetting due to shared model parameters across domains.

Method: ExPaMoE uses a dual-branch expert design with token-guided feature separation and dynamically expands experts using a Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator (SODD).

Result: ExPaMoE outperforms prior methods on benchmarks like CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC, and introduces the ImageNet++ benchmark.

Conclusion: ExPaMoE demonstrates robustness, scalability, and resistance to forgetting, making it superior for CTTA scenarios.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to enable models to adapt
on-the-fly to a stream of unlabeled data under evolving distribution shifts.
However, existing CTTA methods typically rely on shared model parameters across
all domains, making them vulnerable to feature entanglement and catastrophic
forgetting in the presence of large or non-stationary domain shifts. To address
this limitation, we propose \textbf{ExPaMoE}, a novel framework based on an
\emph{Expandable Parallel Mixture-of-Experts} architecture. ExPaMoE decouples
domain-general and domain-specific knowledge via a dual-branch expert design
with token-guided feature separation, and dynamically expands its expert pool
based on a \emph{Spectral-Aware Online Domain Discriminator} (SODD) that
detects distribution changes in real-time using frequency-domain cues.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ExPaMoE across diverse
CTTA scenarios. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks including
CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-to-ACDC for semantic
segmentation. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{ImageNet++}, a large-scale and
realistic CTTA benchmark built from multiple ImageNet-derived datasets, to
better reflect long-term adaptation under complex domain evolution. ExPaMoE
consistently outperforms prior arts, showing strong robustness, scalability,
and resistance to forgetting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-SP enhances multimodal large language models by adding six spatial visual tokens to improve local visual relationships, outperforming LLaVA-1.5 with minimal latency increase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-ViT struggles with local patch relationships, limiting detailed visual understanding in MLLMs.

Method: Proposes LLaVA-SP with a novel Projector using convolutional kernels for spatial tokens, two variants (Cropping and Pooling), and cross-attention for fusion.

Result: Significant performance gains on multimodal benchmarks, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 with similar inference speed.

Conclusion: LLaVA-SP effectively improves visual representation in MLLMs with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The architecture of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) commonly
connects a vision encoder, often based on CLIP-ViT, to a large language model.
While CLIP-ViT works well for capturing global image features, it struggles to
model local relationships between adjacent patches, leading to weaker visual
representation, which in turn affects the detailed understanding ability of
MLLMs. To solve this, we propose LLaVA-SP, which \textbf{ only adds six spatial
visual tokens} to the original visual tokens to enhance the visual
representation. Our approach offers three key advantages: 1)We propose a novel
Projector, which uses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens
from ViT patch features, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches:
``from central region to global" and ``from abstract to specific". Then, a
cross-attention mechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information,
enriching the overall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:
LLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive
cropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through
adaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding
tasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,
achieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal
benchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple
tasks with nearly identical inference latency. The code and models are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCING is a framework for person re-identification that improves cross-modal alignment and robustness using selective visual prompts and perturbation-driven training, achieving efficient performance without complex adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for adapting vision-language models to ReID tasks are computationally costly or lack cross-modal interaction, leading to suboptimal alignment.

Method: SCING introduces Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP) for dynamic visual-text alignment and Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) for robust feature learning under perturbations.

Result: The method outperforms on benchmarks like Market1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SCING offers a lightweight, effective solution for ReID, enhancing cross-modal alignment and robustness without heavy adapters.

Abstract: Recent advancements in adapting vision-language pre-training models like CLIP
for person re-identification (ReID) tasks often rely on complex adapter design
or modality-specific tuning while neglecting cross-modal interaction, leading
to high computational costs or suboptimal alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose a simple yet effective framework named Selective
Cross-modal Prompt Tuning (SCING) that enhances cross-modal alignment and
robustness against real-world perturbations. Our method introduces two key
innovations: Firstly, we proposed Selective Visual Prompt Fusion (SVIP), a
lightweight module that dynamically injects discriminative visual features into
text prompts via a cross-modal gating mechanism. Moreover, the proposed
Perturbation-Driven Consistency Alignment (PDCA) is a dual-path training
strategy that enforces invariant feature alignment under random image
perturbations by regularizing consistency between original and augmented
cross-modal embeddings. Extensive experiments are conducted on several popular
benchmarks covering Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, Occluded-Duke, Occluded-REID,
and P-DukeMTMC, which demonstrate the impressive performance of the proposed
method. Notably, our framework eliminates heavy adapters while maintaining
efficient inference, achieving an optimal trade-off between performance and
computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: TopoNet is a topology-constrained learning framework for laparoscopic liver landmark detection, combining RGB and depth data to improve accuracy while preserving structural integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver landmarks are vital for surgical guidance but are hard to detect due to tubular structures and deformations.

Method: Uses a snake-CNN dual-path encoder and a boundary-aware topology fusion module, with topological constraint losses.

Result: Achieves high accuracy on L3D and P2ILF datasets, showing clinical potential.

Conclusion: TopoNet is effective for liver landmark detection, with promising clinical applications.

Abstract: Liver landmarks provide crucial anatomical guidance to the surgeon during
laparoscopic liver surgery to minimize surgical risk. However, the tubular
structural properties of landmarks and dynamic intraoperative deformations pose
significant challenges for automatic landmark detection. In this study, we
introduce TopoNet, a novel topology-constrained learning framework for
laparoscopic liver landmark detection. Our framework adopts a snake-CNN
dual-path encoder to simultaneously capture detailed RGB texture information
and depth-informed topological structures. Meanwhile, we propose a
boundary-aware topology fusion (BTF) module, which adaptively merges RGB-D
features to enhance edge perception while preserving global topology.
Additionally, a topological constraint loss function is embedded, which
contains a center-line constraint loss and a topological persistence loss to
ensure homotopy equivalence between predictions and labels. Extensive
experiments on L3D and P2ILF datasets demonstrate that TopoNet achieves
outstanding accuracy and computational complexity, highlighting the potential
for clinical applications in laparoscopic liver surgery. Our code will be

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box-QAymo is a dataset and benchmark for evaluating VLMs on spatial and temporal reasoning via user-specified bounding boxes, addressing gaps in real-world interpretability for autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack interpretability in real-world driving scenarios, especially for localized user queries. Existing datasets focus on full-scene descriptions or waypoints, missing nuanced user intent.

Method: Introduces Box-QAymo, a dataset with bounding box-based queries, hierarchical evaluation (binary checks, attribute prediction, motion understanding, spatiotemporal reasoning), and rigorous quality control.

Result: Reveals significant limitations in VLMs for perception questions, highlighting the gap in real-world performance.

Conclusion: Box-QAymo lays groundwork for more robust, interpretable autonomous driving systems by improving VLM communication under real-world conditions.

Abstract: Interpretable communication is essential for safe and trustworthy autonomous
driving, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often operate under
idealized assumptions and struggle to capture user intent in real-world
scenarios. Existing driving-oriented VQA datasets are limited to full-scene
descriptions or waypoint prediction, preventing the assessment of whether VLMs
can respond to localized user-driven queries. We introduce Box-QAymo, a
box-referring dataset and benchmark designed to both evaluate and finetune VLMs
on spatial and temporal reasoning over user-specified objects. Users express
intent by drawing bounding boxes, offering a fast and intuitive interface for
focused queries in complex scenes. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical
evaluation protocol that begins with binary sanity-check questions to assess
basic model capacities, and progresses to (1) attribute prediction for
box-referred objects, (2) motion understanding of target instances, and (3)
spatiotemporal motion reasoning over inter-object dynamics across frames. To
support this, we crowd-sourced fine-grained object classes and visual
attributes that reflect the complexity drivers encounter, and extract object
trajectories to construct temporally grounded QA pairs. Rigorous quality
control through negative sampling, temporal consistency checks, and
difficulty-aware balancing guarantee dataset robustness and diversity. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals significant limitations in current VLMs when
queried about perception questions, highlighting the gap in achieving
real-world performance. This work provides a foundation for developing more
robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems that can communicate
effectively with users under real-world conditions. Project page and dataset

TL;DR: The paper introduces Attention Ablation Technique (AAT) to improve CLIP's performance by selectively disabling harmful attention heads in its image encoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certain attention heads in CLIP's image encoder may degrade performance, and ablating them could enhance downstream task results.

Method: Proposes AAT, a method to suppress detrimental attention heads by manipulating attention weights, using two tailored strategies.

Result: AAT improves downstream tasks, increasing recall by up to 11.1% in cross-modal retrieval, with no added inference cost.

Conclusion: AAT effectively refines vision-language models like CLIP by optimizing attention heads, offering performance gains without extra computational overhead.

Abstract: This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While
CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we
hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final
representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream
tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method,
called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of
specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two
alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT
systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance
representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves
downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up
to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight
the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models
with virtually no increase in inference cost.

*Zhenya Yang,Bingchen Gong,Kai Chen,Qi Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LOD-GS is a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting that dynamically predicts optimal filtering strength to eliminate aliasing artifacts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aliasing artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) persist due to insensitive low-pass filtering methods, leading to under-filtering or over-smoothing.

Method: LOD-GS introduces basis functions to each Gaussian, modeling appearance variations based on sampling rate, and jointly optimizes these parameters with 3D Gaussians.

Result: LOD-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality by effectively eliminating aliasing, validated on public and a new synthetic dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses aliasing in 3DGS dynamically and comprehensively, with open-sourced code and dataset for broader use.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in quality and efficiency achieved by 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) in 3D scene rendering, aliasing artifacts remain a persistent
challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate
aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often
resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this
limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework
for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering
strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of
basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to
model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These
basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an
end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and
camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on
down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation,
overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive
assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at
varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our
newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering
quality while effectively eliminating aliasing. The code and dataset have been
open-sourced.

*Kai Zhou,Shuhai Zhang,Zeng You,Jinwu Hu,Mingkui Tan,Fei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes PGFA, a prototype-guided feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, addressing limitations in existing methods and achieving significant accuracy improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition suffer from insufficient skeleton feature discrimination and alignment bias between skeleton and unseen text features.

Method: PGFA introduces an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive training framework for better skeleton-text alignment and a prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate distribution discrepancies.

Result: PGFA outperforms the top competitor SMIE method with accuracy improvements of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed PGFA effectively addresses the challenges of zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition, demonstrating superior performance through improved feature alignment and discrimination.

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to classify unseen
skeleton-based human actions without prior exposure to such categories during
training. This task is extremely challenging due to the difficulty in
generalizing from known to unknown actions. Previous studies typically use
two-stage training: pre-training skeleton encoders on seen action categories
using cross-entropy loss and then aligning pre-extracted skeleton and text
features, enabling knowledge transfer to unseen classes through skeleton-text
alignment and language models' generalization. However, their efficacy is
hindered by 1) insufficient discrimination for skeleton features, as the fixed
skeleton encoder fails to capture necessary alignment information for effective
skeleton-text alignment; 2) the neglect of alignment bias between skeleton and
unseen text features during testing. To this end, we propose a prototype-guided
feature alignment paradigm for zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition,
termed PGFA. Specifically, we develop an end-to-end cross-modal contrastive
training framework to improve skeleton-text alignment, ensuring sufficient
discrimination for skeleton features. Additionally, we introduce a
prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy to mitigate the adverse impact
of the distribution discrepancy during testing. We provide a theoretical
analysis to support our prototype-guided text feature alignment strategy and
empirically evaluate our overall PGFA on three well-known datasets. Compared
with the top competitor SMIE method, our PGFA achieves absolute accuracy
improvements of 22.96%, 12.53%, and 18.54% on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD
datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable AI systems that can detect objects not seen during training, especially in critical applications like autonomous driving, drives the exploration of OOD detection.

Method: The paper reviews benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and methodologies for OOD detection, including model structures, uncertainty indicators, and distributional distance taxonomies.

Result: A comparative analysis of OOD detection techniques is presented, alongside insights into uncertainty calibration and emerging research opportunities like 3D vision integration.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a guide for researchers, highlighting the importance of OOD detection for developing safe and robust AI systems, with future directions including adversarial robustness and failure identification.

Abstract: The ability to detect objects that are not prevalent in the training set is a
critical capability in many 3D applications, including autonomous driving.
Machine learning methods for object recognition often assume that all object
categories encountered during inference belong to a closed set of classes
present in the training data. This assumption limits generalization to the real
world, as objects not seen during training may be misclassified or entirely
ignored. As part of reliable AI, OOD detection identifies inputs that deviate
significantly from the training distribution. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of OOD detection within the broader scope of trustworthy
and uncertain AI. We begin with key use cases across diverse domains, introduce
benchmark datasets spanning multiple modalities, and discuss evaluation
metrics. Next, we present a comparative analysis of OOD detection
methodologies, exploring model structures, uncertainty indicators, and
distributional distance taxonomies, alongside uncertainty calibration
techniques. Finally, we highlight promising research directions, including
adversarially robust OOD detection and failure identification, particularly
relevant to 3D applications. The paper offers both theoretical and practical
insights into OOD detection, showcasing emerging research opportunities such as
3D vision integration. These insights help new researchers navigate the field
more effectively, contributing to the development of reliable, safe, and robust
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic synthetic videos challenges content authentication, requiring better detection methods that generalize well and capture subtle inconsistencies.

Method: ReStraV leverages the 'perceptual straightening' hypothesis, using DINOv2 to quantify temporal curvature and stepwise distance in videos, then trains a classifier on these metrics.

Result: The method achieves 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on VidProM, outperforming existing techniques.

Conclusion: ReStraV offers an efficient, low-cost solution for AI-generated video detection, advancing the use of neural representation geometry in this field.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic
videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising
urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with
generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose
ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish
natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening"
hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight
in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected
geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer
(DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the
model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for
each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos
exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to
real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection
performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark),
substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is
computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection
solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation
geometry for AI-generated video detection.

*Tang Hao,Guo ZhiQing,Wang LieJun,Liu Chao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sim-MPNet, a network for medical image segmentation, leveraging grandmother cells' recognition capabilities. It includes DMW-LA for dynamic feature matching and DS-GIM for feature distribution analysis, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by grandmother cells in macaque V1, the study aims to advance medical image segmentation by mimicking their recognition of complex shapes.

Method: Sim-MPNet uses DMW-LA for dynamic feature matching and memory updates, and DS-GIM for analyzing feature distribution via cosine similarity and Euclidean distance.

Result: Extensive experiments on four datasets show Sim-MPNet outperforms other methods in segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Sim-MPNet effectively leverages similarity memory and feature analysis for superior medical image segmentation, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In recent years, it has been found that "grandmother cells" in the primary
visual cortex (V1) of macaques can directly recognize visual input with complex
shapes. This inspires us to examine the value of these cells in promoting the
research of medical image segmentation. In this paper, we design a Similarity
Memory Prior Network (Sim-MPNet) for medical image segmentation. Specifically,
we propose a Dynamic Memory Weights-Loss Attention (DMW-LA), which matches and
remembers the category features of specific lesions or organs in medical images
through the similarity memory prior in the prototype memory bank, thus helping
the network to learn subtle texture changes between categories. DMW-LA also
dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss
Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly
extract category features. In addition, we propose the Double-Similarity Global
Internal Enhancement Module (DS-GIM) to deeply explore the internal differences
in the feature distribution of input data through cosine similarity and
euclidean distance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that
Sim-MPNet has better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available on https://github.com/vpsg-research/Sim-MPNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RAER, a novel dataset for academic emotion recognition, and CLIP-CAER, a method combining facial expressions and context cues using CLIP, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Academic emotion recognition is underexplored due to lack of datasets. The paper aims to address this gap by creating a diverse dataset and improving recognition accuracy.

Method: The authors introduce RAER, a dataset of 2,700 video clips annotated by multiple annotators, and propose CLIP-CAER, leveraging CLIP to integrate facial and context cues.

Result: CLIP-CAER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance of context in academic emotion recognition.

Conclusion: The study advances academic emotion recognition by providing a robust dataset and method, demonstrating the significance of contextual cues.

Abstract: Academic emotion analysis plays a crucial role in evaluating students'
engagement and cognitive states during the learning process. This paper
addresses the challenge of automatically recognizing academic emotions through
facial expressions in real-world learning environments. While significant
progress has been made in facial expression recognition for basic emotions,
academic emotion recognition remains underexplored, largely due to the scarcity
of publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAER, a novel
dataset comprising approximately 2,700 video clips collected from around 140
students in diverse, natural learning contexts such as classrooms, libraries,
laboratories, and dormitories, covering both classroom sessions and individual
study. Each clip was annotated independently by approximately ten annotators
using two distinct sets of academic emotion labels with varying granularity,
enhancing annotation consistency and reliability. To our knowledge, RAER is the
first dataset capturing diverse natural learning scenarios. Observing that
annotators naturally consider context cues-such as whether a student is looking
at a phone or reading a book-alongside facial expressions, we propose CLIP-CAER
(CLIP-based Context-aware Academic Emotion Recognition). Our method utilizes
learnable text prompts within the vision-language model CLIP to effectively
integrate facial expression and context cues from videos. Experimental results
demonstrate that CLIP-CAER substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
video-based facial expression recognition methods, which are primarily designed
for basic emotions, emphasizing the crucial role of context in accurately
recognizing academic emotions. Project page: https://zgsfer.github.io/CAER

*Fernando Alonso-Fernandez,Talha Hanif Butt,Prayag Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates ANN, RF, and SVM classifiers for detecting truck overtaking manoeuvres using CAN bus data, finding that data diversity and multi-vehicle training improve performance. A score-level fusion strategy achieves TNR=93% and TPR=86.5%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe overtaking in trucks is crucial for accident prevention and traffic efficiency. Accurate prediction aids ADAS in decision-making.

Method: Used CAN bus data from five Volvo trucks, tested ANN, RF, and SVM classifiers, and applied score-level fusion for improved performance.

Result: Variability in traffic affects signal patterns, but multi-vehicle training enhances generalization. Fusion achieved TNR=93% and TPR=86.5%.

Conclusion: Data diversity and fusion strategies are key for accurate overtake detection, supporting ADAS applications in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Safe overtaking manoeuvres in trucks are vital for preventing accidents and
ensuring efficient traffic flow. Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is
essential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and
informed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using
Controller Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks
provided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle
manoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and
Support Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing
configurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic
conditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the
no-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks
adequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,
real-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,
training with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces
condition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification
accuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per
vehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields
the best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an
accuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True
Positive Rate). This research has been part of the BIG FUN project, which
explores how Artificial Intelligence can be applied to logged vehicle data to
understand and predict driver behaviour, particularly in relation to Camera
Monitor Systems (CMS), being introduced as digital replacements for traditional
exterior mirrors.

TL;DR: World4Drive is an end-to-end autonomous driving framework using vision foundation models for self-supervised learning, eliminating costly perception annotations and achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable perception annotation-free, end-to-end planning by constructing an informative driving world model via self-supervised learning.

Method: Extracts scene features (intention, latent representations), generates multi-modal trajectories, predicts future states, and selects the best trajectory using a world model selector.

Result: Achieves 18.1% lower L2 error, 46.7% fewer collisions, and 3.75x faster training on nuScenes and NavSim benchmarks.

Conclusion: World4Drive demonstrates efficient, annotation-free autonomous driving with superior performance and faster convergence.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving directly generates planning trajectories from
raw sensor data, yet it typically relies on costly perception supervision to
extract scene information. A critical research challenge arises: constructing
an informative driving world model to enable perception annotation-free,
end-to-end planning via self-supervised learning. In this paper, we present
World4Drive, an end-to-end autonomous driving framework that employs vision
foundation models to build latent world models for generating and evaluating
multi-modal planning trajectories. Specifically, World4Drive first extracts
scene features, including driving intention and world latent representations
enriched with spatial-semantic priors provided by vision foundation models. It
then generates multi-modal planning trajectories based on current scene
features and driving intentions and predicts multiple intention-driven future
states within the latent space. Finally, it introduces a world model selector
module to evaluate and select the best trajectory. We achieve perception
annotation-free, end-to-end planning through self-supervised alignment between
actual future observations and predicted observations reconstructed from the
latent space. World4Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance without manual
perception annotations on both the open-loop nuScenes and closed-loop NavSim
benchmarks, demonstrating an 18.1\% relative reduction in L2 error, 46.7% lower
collision rate, and 3.75 faster training convergence. Codes will be accessed at

### [62] [De-Simplifying Pseudo Labels to Enhancing Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00608)
*Zehua Fu,Chenguang Liu,Yuyu Chen,Jiaqi Zhou,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the performance gap between self-labeling and domain alignment methods in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for object detection, attributing it to simple-label bias. It proposes DeSimPL, a method to mitigate this bias using an instance-level memory bank and adversarial samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to reduce reliance on labeled data in traffic and transportation object detection, and the underperformance of self-labeling methods compared to domain alignment methods.

Method: DeSimPL introduces an instance-level memory bank for pseudo label updating, adversarial samples to balance training, and an adaptive weighted loss to handle false positives.

Result: DeSimPL reduces simple-label bias, significantly improving self-labeling detector performance, validated on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: DeSimPL effectively bridges the performance gap between self-labeling and domain alignment methods in UDA for object detection.

Abstract: Despite its significant success, object detection in traffic and
transportation scenarios requires time-consuming and laborious efforts in
acquiring high-quality labeled data. Therefore, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for object detection has recently gained increasing research attention.
UDA for object detection has been dominated by domain alignment methods, which
achieve top performance. Recently, self-labeling methods have gained popularity
due to their simplicity and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the
limitations that prevent self-labeling detectors from achieving commensurate
performance with domain alignment methods. Specifically, we identify the high
proportion of simple samples during training, i.e., the simple-label bias, as
the central cause. We propose a novel approach called De-Simplifying Pseudo
Labels (DeSimPL) to mitigate the issue. DeSimPL utilizes an instance-level
memory bank to implement an innovative pseudo label updating strategy. Then,
adversarial samples are introduced during training to enhance the proportion.
Furthermore, we propose an adaptive weighted loss to avoid the model suffering
from an abundance of false positive pseudo labels in the late training period.
Experimental results demonstrate that DeSimPL effectively reduces the
proportion of simple samples during training, leading to a significant
performance improvement for self-labeling detectors. Extensive experiments
conducted on four benchmarks validate our analysis and conclusions.

*Siyuan Yao,Rui Zhu,Ziqi Wang,Wenqi Ren,Yanyang Yan,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMDATrack improves visual object tracking in adverse weather by using domain adaptation, a scenario generator, and custom adapters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trackers fail in adverse weather due to domain shifts; UMDATrack aims to address this.

Method: Uses a controllable scenario generator for synthetic data, a domain-customized adapter, and a target-aware confidence alignment module.

Result: Outperforms existing trackers significantly in adverse conditions.

Conclusion: UMDATrack sets a new state-of-the-art for robust tracking in diverse weather.

Abstract: Visual object tracking has gained promising progress in past decades. Most of
the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in
well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios
with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the
tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this
paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality
target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a
unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable
scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than
2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the
guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet
effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects'
representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant
model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between
source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment
module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UMDATrack can surpass existing advanced visual trackers and
lead new state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Z-Z188/UMDATrack.

### [64] [LoD-Loc v2: Aerial Visual Localization over Low Level-of-Detail City Models using Explicit Silhouette Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00659)
*Juelin Zhu,Shuaibang Peng,Long Wang,Hanlin Tan,Yu Liu,Maojun Zhang,Shen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoD-Loc v2 introduces a coarse-to-fine strategy for aerial visual localization over low-LoD city models, improving accuracy and enabling localization where previous methods failed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on high-LoD city models, but low-LoD models are more common and planned for nationwide use. Enabling localization on low-LoD models can expand drone applications globally.

Method: LoD-Loc v2 uses building segmentation, a pose cost volume for coarse pose selection, and particle filtering for fine pose estimation.

Result: The method improves accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with low-LoD models, outperforming baselines and texture-model-based methods.

Conclusion: LoD-Loc v2 advances aerial localization by supporting low-LoD models, broadening convergence, and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for aerial visual localization over low
Level-of-Detail (LoD) city models. Previous wireframe-alignment-based method
LoD-Loc has shown promising localization results leveraging LoD models.
However, LoD-Loc mainly relies on high-LoD (LoD3 or LoD2) city models, but the
majority of available models and those many countries plan to construct
nationwide are low-LoD (LoD1). Consequently, enabling localization on low-LoD
city models could unlock drones' potential for global urban localization. To
address these issues, we introduce LoD-Loc v2, which employs a coarse-to-fine
strategy using explicit silhouette alignment to achieve accurate localization
over low-LoD city models in the air. Specifically, given a query image, LoD-Loc
v2 first applies a building segmentation network to shape building silhouettes.
Then, in the coarse pose selection stage, we construct a pose cost volume by
uniformly sampling pose hypotheses around a prior pose to represent the pose
probability distribution. Each cost of the volume measures the degree of
alignment between the projected and predicted silhouettes. We select the pose
with maximum value as the coarse pose. In the fine pose estimation stage, a
particle filtering method incorporating a multi-beam tracking approach is used
to efficiently explore the hypothesis space and obtain the final pose
estimation. To further facilitate research in this field, we release two
datasets with LoD1 city models covering 10.7 km , along with real RGB queries
and ground-truth pose annotations. Experimental results show that LoD-Loc v2
improves estimation accuracy with high-LoD models and enables localization with
low-LoD models for the first time. Moreover, it outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by large margins, even surpassing texture-model-based methods, and
broadens the convergence basin to accommodate larger prior errors.

Motivation: Addressing the lack of realistic and stable whole-body grasping methods and scarcity of hand-object interaction data.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: Grasp Pose Generation, Temporal Infilling, and LiftUp Transformer, with Generalized Pretraining for data efficiency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the GRAB dataset in coherence, stability, and visual realism.

Conclusion: The modular framework is effective for grasping tasks and adaptable to other human-motion applications.

Abstract: Accepted in the ICIP 2025
  We present a novel transformer-based framework for whole-body grasping that
addresses both pose generation and motion infilling, enabling realistic and
stable object interactions. Our pipeline comprises three stages: Grasp Pose
Generation for full-body grasp generation, Temporal Infilling for smooth motion
continuity, and a LiftUp Transformer that refines downsampled joints back to
high-resolution markers. To overcome the scarcity of hand-object interaction
data, we introduce a data-efficient Generalized Pretraining stage on large,
diverse motion datasets, yielding robust spatio-temporal representations
transferable to grasping tasks. Experiments on the GRAB dataset show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of coherence, stability,
and visual realism. The modular design also supports easy adaptation to other
human-motion applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CageAttack introduces a cage-based deformation framework for generating natural adversarial point clouds, balancing transferability, undefendability, and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on point clouds either impose strict geometric constraints (limiting transferability) or introduce unnatural distortions (reducing plausibility).

Method: The framework constructs a cage around the target object, applies perturbations to cage vertices, and propagates these smoothly to the point cloud for natural deformation.

Result: CageAttack outperforms state-of-the-art methods in transferability, undefendability, and plausibility across seven 3D classifiers and three datasets.

Conclusion: CageAttack provides a structured, effective approach for adversarial point cloud generation, achieving superior performance and natural-looking results.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on point clouds often impose strict geometric constraints
to preserve plausibility; however, such constraints inherently limit
transferability and undefendability. While deformation offers an alternative,
existing unstructured approaches may introduce unnatural distortions, making
adversarial point clouds conspicuous and undermining their plausibility. In
this paper, we propose CageAttack, a cage-based deformation framework that
produces natural adversarial point clouds. It first constructs a cage around
the target object, providing a structured basis for smooth, natural-looking
deformation. Perturbations are then applied to the cage vertices, which
seamlessly propagate to the point cloud, ensuring that the resulting
deformations remain intrinsic to the object and preserve plausibility.
Extensive experiments on seven 3D deep neural network classifiers across three
datasets show that CageAttack achieves a superior balance among
transferability, undefendability, and plausibility, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be made public upon acceptance.

*Qihang Fan,Huaibo Huang,Yuang Ai,ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA) to address performance degradation in Linear Attention by incorporating Query magnitude, achieving results close to Softmax Attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear Attention's performance drop compared to Softmax Attention due to ignoring Query magnitude, limiting dynamic adaptation of attention scores.

Method: Proposes MALA, modifying Linear Attention to include Query magnitude, balancing attention score distribution.

Result: MALA performs well on tasks like image classification, NLP, and speech recognition, matching Softmax Attention's effectiveness.

Conclusion: MALA successfully bridges the gap between Linear and Softmax Attention, offering efficient global modeling with improved performance.

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent
global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its
applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar
formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling
efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers
from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax
Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based
on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention,
Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query.
This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the
Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax
Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score
distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear
Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully
incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an
attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while
exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of
MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection,
instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing,
speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on
all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

Motivation: Existing methods treat multi-view image generation as a 2D task, lacking explicit 3D modeling, which is crucial for autonomous driving applications.

Method: BEV-VAE trains a multi-view image variational autoencoder for a compact BEV latent space and generates scenes with a latent diffusion transformer, supporting arbitrary view generation.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 show strong performance in 3D consistent reconstruction and generation.

Conclusion: BEV-VAE provides a structured and effective solution for multi-view image generation in autonomous driving, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-view image generation in autonomous driving demands consistent 3D scene
understanding across camera views. Most existing methods treat this problem as
a 2D image set generation task, lacking explicit 3D modeling. However, we argue
that a structured representation is crucial for scene generation, especially
for autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes BEV-VAE for consistent
and controllable view synthesis. BEV-VAE first trains a multi-view image
variational autoencoder for a compact and unified BEV latent space and then
generates the scene with a latent diffusion transformer. BEV-VAE supports
arbitrary view generation given camera configurations, and optionally 3D
layouts. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 (AV2) show strong performance
in both 3D consistent reconstruction and generation. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoStreamer improves lane segment topology reasoning for autonomous driving with streaming attribute constraints, dynamic positional encoding, and denoising, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack consistent positional embedding and temporal attribute learning, hindering accurate road network reconstruction for autonomous driving.

Method: TopoStreamer introduces streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising for temporal consistency and improved learning.

Result: TopoStreamer achieves +3.4% mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception on OpenLane-V2.

Conclusion: TopoStreamer enhances lane topology reasoning, enabling better autonomous driving maneuvers.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by
capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their
semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform
road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the
limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute
learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address
these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model
for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces
three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute
constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary
coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary
positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information
within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment
patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the
accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which
serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving.
On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.4%
mAP in lane segment perception and +2.1% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

*Xiao Zhang,Fei Wei,Yong Wang,Wenda Zhao,Feiyi Li,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes UPRE, a framework for zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) that jointly optimizes textual prompts and visual representations to address misalignment between detection tasks and Vision-Language Models (VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSDA methods using VLMs overlook misalignment between detection tasks and VLMs, relying on manual prompts. UPRE aims to overcome this by enhancing both prompts and visual representations.

Method: UPRE introduces a multi-view domain prompt combining linguistic priors with detection knowledge and a visual enhancement module for domain style variations. Multi-level strategies align representations at image and instance levels.

Result: Experiments on nine datasets show UPRE's superior performance in ZSDA detection.

Conclusion: UPRE effectively addresses ZSDA challenges by unifying prompt and representation optimization, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) presents substantial challenges due to the
lack of images in the target domain. Previous approaches leverage
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tackle this challenge, exploiting their
zero-shot learning capabilities. However, these methods primarily address
domain distribution shifts and overlook the misalignment between the detection
task and VLMs, which rely on manually crafted prompts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the unified prompt and representation enhancement
(UPRE) framework, which jointly optimizes both textual prompts and visual
representations. Specifically, our approach introduces a multi-view domain
prompt that combines linguistic domain priors with detection-specific
knowledge, and a visual representation enhancement module that produces domain
style variations. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level enhancement strategies,
including relative domain distance and positive-negative separation, which
align multi-modal representations at the image level and capture diverse visual
representations at the instance level, respectively. Extensive experiments
conducted on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of
our framework in ZSDA detection scenarios. Code is available at

*Linghui Zhu,Yiming Li,Haiqin Weng,Yan Liu,Tianwei Zhang,Shu-Tao Xia,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to verify ownership of personalized vision models by decoupling common and dataset-specific features, addressing vulnerabilities in existing defenses against model stealing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defense methods for traditional DNNs are ineffective or risky for fine-tuned models, necessitating a harmless and robust solution for ownership verification.

Method: The method involves creating shadow models to isolate common features, training a meta-classifier to detect dataset-specific features, and using hypothesis testing for verification.

Result: Experiments show the method effectively detects various model stealing attacks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides a secure and reliable way to verify ownership of personalized models, overcoming limitations of existing defenses.

Abstract: Large vision models achieve remarkable performance in various downstream
tasks, primarily by personalizing pre-trained models through fine-tuning with
private and valuable local data, which makes the personalized model a valuable
intellectual property for its owner. Similar to the era of traditional DNNs,
model stealing attacks also pose significant risks to these personalized
models. However, in this paper, we reveal that most existing defense methods
(developed for traditional DNNs), typically designed for models trained from
scratch, either introduce additional security risks, are prone to misjudgment,
or are even ineffective for fine-tuned models. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes a harmless model ownership verification method for
personalized models by decoupling similar common features. In general, our
method consists of three main stages. In the first stage, we create shadow
models that retain common features of the victim model while disrupting
dataset-specific features. We represent the dataset-specific features of the
victim model by the output differences between the shadow and victim models.
After that, a meta-classifier is trained to identify stolen models by
determining whether suspicious models contain the dataset-specific features of
the victim. In the third stage, we conduct model ownership verification by
hypothesis test to mitigate randomness and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method in detecting different types of model stealing simultaneously.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel biorthogonal tunable wavelet unit using a lifting scheme improves CNN operations, enhancing image classification and anomaly detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide greater flexibility in filter design by relaxing orthogonality and equal filter length constraints, improving CNN performance.

Method: Constructs a biorthogonal tunable wavelet unit via a lifting scheme, integrated into ResNet architectures for testing.

Result: Improved classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 (2.12%) and DTD (9.73%), and competitive anomaly detection performance on MVTec.

Conclusion: The proposed wavelet unit effectively enhances CNN performance in classification and anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel biorthogonal tunable wavelet unit constructed
using a lifting scheme that relaxes both the orthogonality and equal filter
length constraints, providing greater flexibility in filter design. The
proposed unit enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations,
leading to improved image classification and anomaly detection in convolutional

(ResNet-18), the approach improved classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 2.12%
and on the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) by 9.73%, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing fine-grained details. Similar improvements were
observed in ResNet-34. For anomaly detection in the hazelnut category of the
MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, the proposed method achieved competitive and
wellbalanced performance in both segmentation and detection tasks,
outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.

*Zifu Wan,Ce Zhang,Silong Yong,Martin Q. Ma,Simon Stepputtis,Louis-Philippe Morency,Deva Ramanan,Katia Sycara,Yaqi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ONLY is a training-free decoding method for LVLMs that reduces hallucination by amplifying key textual info using a text-to-visual entropy ratio, enabling efficient real-time deployment with a single query.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in LVLMs limits their reliability in real-world applications, and existing contrastive decoding methods are too slow for real-time use.

Method: ONLY uses a one-layer intervention and a text-to-visual entropy ratio to selectively amplify crucial textual information during decoding, requiring only a single query.

Result: ONLY outperforms state-of-the-art methods across benchmarks with minimal computational cost and implementation effort.

Conclusion: ONLY provides an efficient, training-free solution to mitigate hallucination in LVLMs, suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have introduced a new paradigm
for understanding and reasoning about image input through textual responses.
Although they have achieved remarkable performance across a range of
multi-modal tasks, they face the persistent challenge of hallucination, which
introduces practical weaknesses and raises concerns about their reliable
deployment in real-world applications. Existing work has explored contrastive
decoding approaches to mitigate this issue, where the output of the original
LVLM is compared and contrasted with that of a perturbed version. However,
these methods require two or more queries that slow down LVLM response
generation, making them less suitable for real-time applications. To overcome
this limitation, we propose ONLY, a training-free decoding approach that
requires only a single query and a one-layer intervention during decoding,
enabling efficient real-time deployment. Specifically, we enhance textual
outputs by selectively amplifying crucial textual information using a
text-to-visual entropy ratio for each token. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed ONLY consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various benchmarks while requiring minimal implementation effort
and computational cost. Code is available at https://github.com/zifuwan/ONLY.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training strategy improves Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for multi-image grounding tasks, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with complex multi-image compositions and multimodal instructions, highlighting limitations in cross-image reasoning and generalization.

Method: The approach involves synthesizing chain-of-thought data for cold-start initialization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA, rejection sampling for RL data, and rule-based RL to guide reasoning.

Result: Achieves +9.04% on MIG-Bench and +4.98% on out-of-domain benchmarks, with +3.1% and +2.4% gains on BLINK and MMIU subsets.

Conclusion: The RL-based post-training strategy effectively enhances MLLMs' multi-image reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual grounding
in single-image scenarios with textual references. However, their performance
degrades when handling real-world applications involving complex multi-image
compositions and multimodal instructions, which reveals limitations in
cross-image reasoning and generalization. To address these challenges, we adopt
a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based post-training strategy to improve the
reasoning performance of MLLMs in multi-image grounding tasks. Our approach
begins with synthesizing high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data for
cold-start initialization, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The cold-start training stage enables the model to
identify correct solutions. Subsequently, we perform rejection sampling using
the merged SFT model to curate high-quality RL data and leverage rule-based RL
to guide the model toward optimal reasoning paths. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving +9.04\%
improvements on MIG-Bench and +4.98\% improvements on several out-of-domain
reasoning grounding benchmarks over the SFT baseline. Furthermore, our approach
exhibits strong generalization in multi-image perception, with gains of +3.1\%
and +2.4\% over the base model on subsets of the BLINK and MMIU benchmarks,
respectively.

*Hao Xing,Kai Zhe Boey,Yuankai Wu,Darius Burschka,Gordon Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) to improve temporal segmentation of human actions by integrating low-frame-rate visual data with high-frame-rate motion data, reducing over-segmentation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate temporal segmentation is critical for robots in collaborative settings, but noise in pose and object detection leads to over-segmentation errors.

Method: Uses MMGCN with sinusoidal encoding for spatial robustness, temporal graph fusion for multi-modal alignment, and SmoothLabelMix for data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on Bimanual Actions Dataset with F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

Conclusion: The MMGCN framework effectively mitigates fragmentation and enhances temporal consistency in action segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent
robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity
labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise
in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to
over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To
address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that
integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,
30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.
Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding
strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to
enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion
module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via
hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions
inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation
technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training
examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in
predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.
  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for
human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation
accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUViT bridges the modality gap between LLMs and ViTs via joint pre-training, enhancing vision tasks by aligning LLM and ViT features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the modality mismatch between text-centric LLMs and vision-centric ViTs to fully leverage LLM knowledge for vision tasks.

Method: Uses Masked Auto-Encoding (MAE) for ViT pre-training and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers in the LLM block, jointly optimized.

Result: LUViT improves performance on downstream vision tasks by aligning LLM and ViT features.

Conclusion: LUViT provides an effective, efficient way to integrate LLM knowledge into visual understanding.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Model (LLMs) blocks with Vision
Transformers (ViTs) holds immense promise for vision-only tasks by leveraging
the rich semantic knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, a
fundamental challenge lies in the inherent modality mismatch between
text-centric pretraining of LLMs and vision-centric training of ViTs. Direct
fusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from
unstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the
vision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce
Language-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges
this modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT
co-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked
Auto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and
(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM
block using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to
produce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual
information. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT
significantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks,
showcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for
visual understanding.

### [77] [Towards Open-World Human Action Segmentation Using Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00756)
*Hao Xing,Kai Zhe Boey,Gordon Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for open-world human-object interaction segmentation, introducing innovations like EPGCN, mixup-based training, and Temporal Clustering loss, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge, necessitating models that handle out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation.

Method: The framework includes an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional Network (EPGCN), mixup-based training for synthetic out-of-distribution data, and a Temporal Clustering loss.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art models, with 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation and out-of-distribution detection.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses open-world action segmentation, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Human-object interaction segmentation is a fundamental task of daily activity
understanding, which plays a crucial role in applications such as assistive
robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Most existing learning-based
methods excel in closed-world action segmentation, they struggle to generalize
to open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge. Collecting exhaustive
action categories for training is impractical due to the dynamic diversity of
human activities, necessitating models that detect and segment
out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation. To address this issue,
we formally define the open-world action segmentation problem and propose a
structured framework for detecting and segmenting unseen actions. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: 1) an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional
Network (EPGCN) with a novel decoder module for robust spatiotemporal feature
upsampling. 2) Mixup-based training to synthesize out-of-distribution data,
eliminating reliance on manual annotations. 3) A novel Temporal Clustering loss
that groups in-distribution actions while distancing out-of-distribution
samples.
  We evaluate our framework on two challenging human-object interaction
recognition datasets: Bimanual Actions and 2 Hands and Object (H2O) datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
action segmentation models across multiple open-set evaluation metrics,
achieving 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation (F1@50) and
out-of-distribution detection performances (AUROC), respectively. Additionally,
we conduct an in-depth ablation study to assess the impact of each proposed
component, identifying the optimal framework configuration for open-world
action segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OptiPrune combines noise optimization and token pruning to improve semantic alignment in text-to-image diffusion models efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either increase computational overhead or reduce semantic fidelity, limiting practical deployment.

Method: OptiPrune uses distribution-aware noise optimization and similarity-based token pruning to enhance alignment and efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with reduced computational cost on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: OptiPrune effectively balances semantic alignment and efficiency in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often struggle to achieve accurate semantic
alignment between generated images and text prompts while maintaining
efficiency for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Existing approaches
either incur substantial computational overhead through noise optimization or
compromise semantic fidelity by aggressively pruning tokens. In this work, we
propose OptiPrune, a unified framework that combines distribution-aware initial
noise optimization with similarity-based token pruning to address both
challenges simultaneously. Specifically, (1) we introduce a distribution-aware
noise optimization module guided by attention scores to steer the initial
latent noise toward semantically meaningful regions, mitigating issues such as
subject neglect and feature entanglement; (2) we design a hardware-efficient
token pruning strategy that selects representative base tokens via patch-wise
similarity, injects randomness to enhance generalization, and recovers pruned
tokens using maximum similarity copying before attention operations. Our method
preserves the Gaussian prior during noise optimization and enables efficient
inference without sacrificing alignment quality. Experiments on benchmark
datasets, including Animal-Animal, demonstrate that OptiPrune achieves
state-of-the-art prompt-image consistency with significantly reduced
computational cost.

Motivation: Address limitations of existing methods, which are either task-specific or rely on paired datasets, by proposing a generalizable, dataset-free approach.

Method: Utilizes a pretrained latent diffusion model with multimodal understanding for semantic priors, a lightweight module for alignment, and recurrent refinement for posterior sampling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a unified, dataset-free solution for image restoration, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Unified image restoration is a significantly challenging task in low-level
vision. Existing methods either make tailored designs for specific tasks,
limiting their generalizability across various types of degradation, or rely on
training with paired datasets, thereby suffering from closed-set constraints.
To address these issues, we propose a novel, dataset-free, and unified approach
through recurrent posterior sampling utilizing a pretrained latent diffusion
model. Our method incorporates the multimodal understanding model to provide
sematic priors for the generative model under a task-blind condition.
Furthermore, it utilizes a lightweight module to align the degraded input with
the generated preference of the diffusion model, and employs recurrent
refinement for posterior sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness and
robustness. Our code and data will be available at

Abstract: Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of
high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive
virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel
real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D medical image generation methods lack anatomical fidelity, have restricted axial length, and are computationally expensive, making them impractical for resource-limited regions.

Method: TRACE models 2D slices as video frame pairs, using segmentation priors, radiology reports, and optical flow for alignment and coherence. An overlapping-frame strategy links frames into sequences for 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: TRACE offers a reliable and efficient solution for 3D medical image generation, suitable for clinical practice and resource-limited settings.

Abstract: 3D medical image generation is essential for data augmentation and patient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored vulnerabilities in V-MLLMs due to complex cross-modal reasoning and computational constraints.

Method: Uses a dual-objective semantic-visual loss and a two-stage generator framework for efficient adversarial attacks.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 22.8% on commercial and open-source models, with 34.4% gain in image understanding.

Conclusion: CAVALRY-V is a foundational approach for adversarial research in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (V-MLLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in temporal reasoning and cross-modal understanding, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains underexplored due to unique
challenges: complex cross-modal reasoning mechanisms, temporal dependencies,
and computational constraints. We present CAVALRY-V (Cross-modal
Language-Vision Adversarial Yielding for Videos), a novel framework that
directly targets the critical interface between visual perception and language
generation in V-MLLMs. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dual-objective semantic-visual loss function that simultaneously disrupts the
model's text generation logits and visual representations to undermine
cross-modal integration, and (2) a computationally efficient two-stage
generator framework that combines large-scale pre-training for cross-model
transferability with specialized fine-tuning for spatiotemporal coherence.
Empirical evaluation on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks
demonstrates that CAVALRY-V significantly outperforms existing attack methods,
achieving 22.8% average improvement over the best baseline attacks on both
commercial systems (GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0) and open-source models (QwenVL-2.5,
InternVL-2.5, Llava-Video, Aria, MiniCPM-o-2.6). Our framework achieves
flexibility through implicit temporal coherence modeling rather than explicit
regularization, enabling significant performance improvements even on image
understanding (34.4% average gain). This capability demonstrates CAVALRY-V's
potential as a foundational approach for adversarial research across multimodal
systems.

Motivation: Traditional PSD methods are manual and time-consuming; CNNs offer automated, real-time solutions.

Method: Trained CNNs (ResNet-50, InceptionV3, EfficientNet-B0) on synthetic particle images generated with Blender.

Result: EfficientNet-B0 showed the best computational efficiency with comparable accuracy across models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data enables robust CNN training for real-time industrial PSD monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate particle size distribution (PSD) measurement is important in
industries such as mining, pharmaceuticals, and fertilizer manufacturing,
significantly influencing product quality and operational efficiency.
Traditional PSD methods like sieve analysis and laser diffraction are manual,
time-consuming, and limited by particle overlap. Recent developments in
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enable automated, real-time PSD estimation
directly from particle images. In this work, we present a CNN-based methodology
trained on realistic synthetic particle imagery generated using Blender's
advanced rendering capabilities. Synthetic data sets using this method can
replicate various industrial scenarios by systematically varying particle
shapes, textures, lighting, and spatial arrangements that closely resemble the
actual configurations. We evaluated three CNN-based architectures, ResNet-50,
InceptionV3, and EfficientNet-B0, for predicting critical PSD parameters (d10,
d50, d90). Results demonstrated comparable accuracy across models, with
EfficientNet-B0 achieving the best computational efficiency suitable for

TL;DR: HEGS-DETR is a real-time Detection Transformer framework for UAV-based object detection, addressing challenges like small targets and cluttered backgrounds with novel modules like HFESNet, ESOP, SQR, and GAPE, achieving improved performance on the VisDrone dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UAV-OD algorithms struggle with small targets, high-density distributions, and cluttered backgrounds due to reliance on hand-crafted components and lack of aerial-specific optimizations.

Method: Proposes HEGS-DETR with HFESNet for high-frequency detail preservation, ESOP for small object detection, and SQR and GAPE for decoder stability and localization accuracy.

Result: Achieves 5.1% AP50 and 3.8% AP increase over baseline on VisDrone, with real-time speed and reduced parameters.

Conclusion: HEGS-DETR effectively addresses UAV-OD challenges, outperforming existing methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-based Object Detection (UAV-OD) faces substantial
challenges, including small target sizes, high-density distributions, and
cluttered backgrounds in UAV imagery. Current algorithms often depend on
hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit
limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is
threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic
architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics,
resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks
have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address
these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time
Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the
High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone.
HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust
semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and
occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object
Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with
minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection.
Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware
Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and
localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing
explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset
demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1\% AP$_{50}$ and 3.8\% AP increase
over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter
count by 4M.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Echo Top Height (ETH) as an auxiliary input for deep learning-based precipitation nowcasting, finding mixed results but highlighting its potential for improving low rain-rate predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve short-term rainfall prediction by incorporating vertical radar information (ETH) alongside traditional 2D reflectivity data, addressing limitations of current deep learning models.

Method: Implemented a 3D U-Net to process radar reflectivity and ETH as separate inputs, analyzing their relationship and impact on nowcasting accuracy.

Result: ETH improved predictions at low rain rates but caused underestimation and inconsistency at higher intensities, with case studies showing varied effects.

Conclusion: ETH shows promise for nowcasting but requires further refinement; the study underscores the need to critically evaluate additional variables for performance gains.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting -- the short-term prediction of rainfall using
recent radar observations -- is critical for weather-sensitive sectors such as
transportation, agriculture, and disaster mitigation. While recent deep
learning models have shown promise in improving nowcasting skill, most
approaches rely solely on 2D radar reflectivity fields, discarding valuable
vertical information available in the full 3D radar volume. In this work, we
explore the use of Echo Top Height (ETH), a 2D projection indicating the
maximum altitude of radar reflectivity above a given threshold, as an auxiliary
input variable for deep learning-based nowcasting. We examine the relationship
between ETH and radar reflectivity, confirming its relevance for predicting
rainfall intensity. We implement a single-pass 3D U-Net that processes both the
radar reflectivity and ETH as separate input channels. While our models are
able to leverage ETH to improve skill at low rain-rate thresholds, results are
inconsistent at higher intensities and the models with ETH systematically
underestimate precipitation intensity. Three case studies are used to
illustrate how ETH can help in some cases, but also confuse the models and
increase the error variance. Nonetheless, the study serves as a foundation for
critically assessing the potential contribution of additional variables to
nowcasting performance.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) object detection has been widely used in

multimodal UAV object detection method. Mamba has demonstrated considerable
potential in multimodal image fusion. Leveraging this, we propose UAVD-Mamba, a
multimodal UAV object detection framework based on Mamba architectures. To
improve geometric adaptability, we propose the Deformable Token Mamba Block
(DTMB) to generate deformable tokens by incorporating adaptive patches from
deformable convolutions alongside normal patches from normal convolutions,
which serve as the inputs to the Mamba Block. To optimize the multimodal
feature complementarity, we design two separate DTMBs for the RGB and infrared
(IR) modalities, with the outputs from both DTMBs integrated into the Mamba
Block for feature extraction and into the Fusion Mamba Block for feature
fusion. Additionally, to improve multiscale object detection, especially for
small objects, we stack four DTMBs at different scales to produce multiscale
feature representations, which are then sent to the Detection Neck for Mamba
(DNM). The DNM module, inspired by the YOLO series, includes modifications to
the SPPF and C3K2 of YOLOv11 to better handle the multiscale features. In
particular, we employ cross-enhanced spatial attention before the DTMB and
cross-channel attention after the Fusion Mamba Block to extract more
discriminative features. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset show
that our method outperforms the baseline OAFA method by 3.6% in the mAP metric.

TL;DR: SafeMap is a novel framework for robust HD map construction in autonomous driving, addressing incomplete multi-view camera data with Gaussian-based reconstruction and distillation-based correction modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with incomplete multi-view camera data, which is critical for accurate HD map construction in autonomous driving.

Method: SafeMap integrates Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) and Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View Correction (D-BEVC) to dynamically prioritize informative regions and correct BEV representations.

Result: SafeMap outperforms previous methods in both complete and incomplete scenarios, demonstrating superior performance and reliability.

Conclusion: SafeMap offers a plug-and-play solution for robust HD map generation, enhancing accuracy even with missing camera views.

Abstract: Robust high-definition (HD) map construction is vital for autonomous driving,
yet existing methods often struggle with incomplete multi-view camera data.
This paper presents SafeMap, a novel framework specifically designed to secure
accuracy even when certain camera views are missing. SafeMap integrates two key
components: the Gaussian-based Perspective View Reconstruction (G-PVR) module
and the Distillation-based Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) Correction (D-BEVC) module.
G-PVR leverages prior knowledge of view importance to dynamically prioritize
the most informative regions based on the relationships among available camera
views. Furthermore, D-BEVC utilizes panoramic BEV features to correct the BEV
representations derived from incomplete observations. Together, these
components facilitate the end-to-end map reconstruction and robust HD map
generation. SafeMap is easy to implement and integrates seamlessly into
existing systems, offering a plug-and-play solution for enhanced robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that SafeMap significantly outperforms
previous methods in both complete and incomplete scenarios, highlighting its
superior performance and reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for training visual in-context learners to handle sequences of tasks without re-training, using synthetic task generation and masking-based objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable a single model to adapt to multiple and new tasks during test time, focusing on sequences of tasks rather than individual ones.

Method: Examine visual in-context learning architectures, introduce a synthetic compositional task generation engine, and explore masking-based training objectives.

Result: Provides insights for multi-modal medical task sequences and identifies challenges in training models for complex tasks.

Conclusion: The approach advances visual in-context learning for compositional tasks but highlights unresolved challenges.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of visual in-context learning to
enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during
test time without re-training. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on
training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than
individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple
intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision
pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the
properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a
particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for
training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation
engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation
datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional
tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives
to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex,
compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights
especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights
challenges that need to be addressed.

*Anna-Maria Halacheva,Jan-Nico Zaech,Xi Wang,Danda Pani Paudel,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scene-centric 3D Vision-Language Model (VLM) using Gaussian splat scenes embeds linguistic features directly into 3D representations, improving generalization and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D VLMs rely heavily on object detectors, causing bottlenecks and limiting flexibility. The paper aims to overcome these issues with a more efficient and flexible approach.

Method: Proposes a scene-centric 3D VLM that embeds language into Gaussian primitives for early modality alignment. Uses a dual sparsifier to distill dense representations into task-relevant tokens.

Result: The model improves prior 3D VLM performance fivefold in out-of-domain settings, leveraging photorealistic 3D representations from RGB images.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances 3D scene understanding by reducing dependency on object detectors and enhancing generalization through early modality alignment and task-aware representations.

Abstract: As multimodal language models advance, their application to 3D scene
understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object
detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic
flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM
for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene
representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the
3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive,
achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense
representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into
compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways,
producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present
the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D
representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong
generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in
out-of-the-domain settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Image2GS improves 3D scene reconstruction from a single image by focusing on visible regions using masked training, outperforming baselines and matching state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by separating the lifting (visible regions) and completion (unseen regions) tasks.

Method: Uses visibility masks from optimized 3D Gaussian splats to train discriminative models on visible regions only, improving reconstruction quality.

Result: Image2GS outperforms baselines in visible regions and matches state-of-the-art models on complete scenes, despite training only on masked data.

Conclusion: Specializing in image-to-3D lifting with masked training improves reconstruction quality and highlights challenges in fitting unseen regions.

Abstract: We present Image2GS, a novel approach that addresses the challenging problem
of reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes from a single image by focusing
specifically on the image-to-3D lifting component of the reconstruction
process. By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model
representing what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating
content not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable
for discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from
optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view
during training. This masked training strategy significantly improves
reconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines.
Notably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains
competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target
images when evaluated on complete scenes. Our findings highlight the
fundamental struggle discriminative models face when fitting unseen regions and
demonstrate the advantages of addressing image-to-3D lifting as a distinct
problem with specialized techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-image NeRF training for surgery using preoperative MRI and neural style transfer, achieving high fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF's reliance on extensive multi-view data is impractical for surgical intraoperative settings due to time constraints. This work aims to overcome this by using a single intraoperative image and preoperative data.

Method: Leverage preoperative MRI for camera viewpoints and images. Use neural style transfer (WTC2 and STROTSS) to adapt intraoperative appearance to the pre-constructed dataset, enabling fast NeRF training.

Result: Evaluated on four neurosurgical cases, the method shows high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment compared to real surgical images and ground truth.

Conclusion: Feasibility of single-image NeRF training in surgery is demonstrated, addressing the limitations of multi-view methods.

Abstract: Purpose: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) offer exceptional capabilities for 3D
reconstruction and view synthesis, yet their reliance on extensive multi-view
data limits their application in surgical intraoperative settings where only
limited data is available. In particular, collecting such extensive data
intraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses
this challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative
data to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.
  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera
viewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.
Intraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the
pre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically
combining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables
the creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.
  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.
Quantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope
images demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics
indicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared
with ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,
confirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.
  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF
training in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional
multi-view methods.

TL;DR: RTMap enhances single-traversal HD mapping by crowdsourcing a multi-traversal map, addressing uncertainty, localization, and real-time road changes, improving map quality and localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of single-traversal HD mapping methods, such as perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion, and lack of multi-agent fusion.

Method: Proposes RTMap, an end-to-end solution with uncertainty-aware positional modeling, probabilistic localization, and real-time road change detection.

Result: Demonstrates improved map quality and localization accuracy on public datasets, benefiting downstream modules.

Conclusion: RTMap effectively improves map accuracy and freshness while robustly supporting autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: While recent online HD mapping methods relieve burdened offline pipelines and
solve map freshness, they remain limited by perceptual inaccuracies, occlusion
in dense traffic, and an inability to fuse multi-agent observations. We propose
RTMap to enhance these single-traversal methods by persistently crowdsourcing a
multi-traversal HD map as a self-evolutional memory. On onboard agents, RTMap
simultaneously addresses three core challenges in an end-to-end fashion: (1)
Uncertainty-aware positional modeling for HD map elements, (2)
probabilistic-aware localization w.r.t. the crowdsourced prior-map, and (3)
real-time detection for possible road structural changes. Experiments on
several public autonomous driving datasets demonstrate our solid performance on
both the prior-aided map quality and the localization accuracy, demonstrating
our effectiveness of robustly serving downstream prediction and planning
modules while gradually improving the accuracy and freshness of the
crowdsourced prior-map asynchronously. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RTMap (Camera ready version
incorporating reviewer suggestions will be updated soon).

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDE, a new benchmark for evaluating robustness in monocular depth estimation, addressing gaps in standard benchmarks that focus only on accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard benchmarks for monocular depth estimation lack robustness evaluation, limiting their ability to assess model performance comprehensively.

Method: The authors propose PDE, a procedurally generated benchmark that tests robustness to controlled perturbations like object, camera, material, and lighting changes.

Result: The analysis identifies challenging perturbations for state-of-the-art depth models, providing insights for future research.

Conclusion: PDE offers a systematic way to evaluate robustness in depth estimation, with findings that can guide further improvements in the field.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed substantial progress on monocular depth
estimation, particularly as measured by the success of large models on standard
benchmarks. However, performance on standard benchmarks does not offer a
complete assessment, because most evaluate accuracy but not robustness. In this
work, we introduce PDE (Procedural Depth Evaluation), a new benchmark which
enables systematic robustness evaluation. PDE uses procedural generation to
create 3D scenes that test robustness to various controlled perturbations,
including object, camera, material and lighting changes. Our analysis yields
interesting findings on what perturbations are challenging for state-of-the-art
depth models, which we hope will inform further research. Code and data are

TL;DR: A new segmentation-guided framework improves text-to-image generation by using pixel-level visual text masks for better glyph, color, and style fidelity, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate visual text rendering in text-to-image generation is challenging due to blurred glyphs, semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods are inflexible and computationally heavy.

Method: Proposes a framework with a fine-tuned bilingual segmentation model for text mask extraction and a streamlined diffusion model with adaptive glyph conditioning and region-specific loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark and introduces new benchmarks (GlyphMM-benchmark, MiniText-benchmark), outperforming prior methods significantly.

Conclusion: The method excels in small text rendering and complex layout preservation, demonstrating strong generalization and readiness for deployment.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has greatly advanced content creation, yet
accurately rendering visual text remains a key challenge due to blurred glyphs,
semantic drift, and limited style control. Existing methods often rely on
pre-rendered glyph images as conditions, but these struggle to retain original
font styles and color cues, necessitating complex multi-branch designs that
increase model overhead and reduce flexibility. To address these issues, we
propose a segmentation-guided framework that uses pixel-level visual text masks
-- rich in glyph shape, color, and spatial detail -- as unified conditional
inputs. Our method introduces two core components: (1) a fine-tuned bilingual
segmentation model for precise text mask extraction, and (2) a streamlined
diffusion model augmented with adaptive glyph conditioning and a
region-specific loss to preserve textual fidelity in both content and style.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AnyText benchmark,
significantly surpassing prior methods in both Chinese and English settings. To
enable more rigorous evaluation, we also introduce two new benchmarks:
GlyphMM-benchmark for testing layout and glyph consistency in complex
typesetting, and MiniText-benchmark for assessing generation quality in
small-scale text regions. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing methods by a large margin in both scenarios, particularly excelling at
small text rendering and complex layout preservation, validating its strong
generalization and deployment readiness.

findings in the development of the reasoning-centric training framework. We
first develop a capable vision foundation model with significant potential

TL;DR: ShapeEmbed is a self-supervised framework for invariant shape descriptors in 2D images, outperforming existing methods in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shape quantification needs invariance to transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation. Traditional descriptors have limitations.

Method: ShapeEmbed encodes object contours (as Euclidean distance matrices) into invariant descriptors using self-supervised learning.

Result: Outperforms competitors in shape classification on natural and biological images.

Conclusion: ShapeEmbed is particularly relevant for biological imaging, offering robust, invariant shape descriptors.

Abstract: The shape of objects is an important source of visual information in a wide
range of applications. One of the core challenges of shape quantification is to
ensure that the extracted measurements remain invariant to transformations that
preserve an object's intrinsic geometry, such as changing its size,
orientation, and position in the image. In this work, we introduce ShapeEmbed,
a self-supervised representation learning framework designed to encode the
contour of objects in 2D images, represented as a Euclidean distance matrix,
into a shape descriptor that is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation,
reflection, and point indexing. Our approach overcomes the limitations of
traditional shape descriptors while improving upon existing state-of-the-art
autoencoder-based approaches. We demonstrate that the descriptors learned by
our framework outperform their competitors in shape classification tasks on
natural and biological images. We envision our approach to be of particular
relevance to biological imaging applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating temporally consistent frames in VSR due to complex degradations and the limitations of existing methods.

Method: Proposes DAM-VSR, which separates VSR into appearance enhancement (using reference image super-resolution) and motion control (using video ControlNet), with a motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy for longer videos.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world and AIGC data, demonstrating superior detail generation.

Conclusion: DAM-VSR effectively combines generative priors and super-resolution capabilities to address VSR challenges, offering improved results.

Abstract: Real-world video super-resolution (VSR) presents significant challenges due
to complex and unpredictable degradations. Although some recent methods utilize
image diffusion models for VSR and have shown improved detail generation
capabilities, they still struggle to produce temporally consistent frames. We
attempt to use Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) combined with ControlNet to address
this issue. However, due to the intrinsic image-animation characteristics of
SVD, it is challenging to generate fine details using only low-quality videos.
To tackle this problem, we propose DAM-VSR, an appearance and motion
disentanglement framework for VSR. This framework disentangles VSR into
appearance enhancement and motion control problems. Specifically, appearance
enhancement is achieved through reference image super-resolution, while motion
control is achieved through video ControlNet. This disentanglement fully
leverages the generative prior of video diffusion models and the detail
generation capabilities of image super-resolution models. Furthermore, equipped
with the proposed motion-aligned bidirectional sampling strategy, DAM-VSR can
conduct VSR on longer input videos. DAM-VSR achieves state-of-the-art
performance on real-world data and AIGC data, demonstrating its powerful detail
generation capabilities.

TL;DR: DiMo-GUI is a training-free framework for GUI grounding that uses dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization to improve accuracy by splitting GUIs into textual and iconic elements and refining predictions hierarchically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and language ambiguity in GUIs make grounding natural language queries challenging.

Method: DiMo-GUI splits GUIs into textual and iconic elements, uses vision-language models for independent reasoning, and dynamically refines predictions by focusing on candidate regions.

Result: The framework shows consistent improvements over baseline methods on standard GUI grounding benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiMo-GUI effectively combines modality separation and region-focused reasoning to disambiguate visually crowded GUI layouts without additional training.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) poses
unique challenges due to the diversity of visual elements, spatial clutter, and
the ambiguity of language. In this paper, we introduce DiMo-GUI, a
training-free framework for GUI grounding that leverages two core strategies:
dynamic visual grounding and modality-aware optimization. Instead of treating
the GUI as a monolithic image, our method splits the input into textual
elements and iconic elements, allowing the model to reason over each modality
independently using general-purpose vision-language models. When predictions
are ambiguous or incorrect, DiMo-GUI dynamically focuses attention by
generating candidate focal regions centered on the model's initial predictions
and incrementally zooms into subregions to refine the grounding result. This
hierarchical refinement process helps disambiguate visually crowded layouts
without the need for additional training or annotations. We evaluate our
approach on standard GUI grounding benchmarks and demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline inference pipelines, highlighting the effectiveness
of combining modality separation with region-focused reasoning.

tabular formats, presenting significant retrieval challenges for conventional
language models. These challenges are pronounced when processing Talent
documentation that requires precise interpretation of tabular relationships for
accurate information retrieval and downstream decision-making. Current table
extraction methods struggle with semantic understanding, resulting in poor
performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented chat applications. This
paper identifies a key bottleneck - while structural table information can be
extracted, the semantic relationships between tabular elements are lost,
causing downstream query failures. To address this, we introduce TalentMine, a
novel LLM-enhanced framework that transforms extracted tables into semantically
enriched representations. Unlike conventional approaches relying on CSV or text
linearization, our method employs specialized multimodal reasoning to preserve
both structural and semantic dimensions of tabular data. Experimental
evaluation across employee benefits document collections demonstrates
TalentMine's superior performance, achieving 100% accuracy in query answering
tasks compared to 0% for standard AWS Textract extraction and 40% for AWS
Textract Visual Q&A capabilities. Our comparative analysis also reveals that
the Claude v3 Haiku model achieves optimal performance for talent management
applications. The key contributions of this work include (1) a systematic
analysis of semantic information loss in current table extraction pipelines,
(2) a novel LLM-based method for semantically enriched table representation,
(3) an efficient integration framework for retrieval-augmented systems as
end-to-end systems, and (4) comprehensive benchmarks on talent analytics tasks
showing substantial improvements across multiple categories.

*Thomas M. Deucher,Juan C. Verduzco,Michael Titus,Alejandro Strachan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A distributed self-driving lab (SDL) using FAIR data and machine learning accelerates scientific discovery, demonstrated with a frugal twin experiment for color optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance collaboration and efficiency in scientific discovery by integrating FAIR data infrastructure with SDLs and machine learning.

Method: Implemented a distributed SDL on nanoHUB, combining online simulation, FAIR data management, and active learning for sequential optimization.

Result: Enabled shared data, real-time ML model updates, and collaborative optimization, demonstrated with a frugal twin color experiment.

Conclusion: The framework is scalable, applicable to diverse optimization tasks, and promotes accessible, collaborative research.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning with automated experimentation in
self-driving laboratories (SDL) offers a powerful approach to accelerate
discovery and optimization tasks in science and engineering applications. When
supported by findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data
infrastructure, SDLs with overlapping interests can collaborate more
effectively. This work presents a distributed SDL implementation built on
nanoHUB services for online simulation and FAIR data management. In this
framework, geographically dispersed collaborators conducting independent
optimization tasks contribute raw experimental data to a shared central
database. These researchers can then benefit from analysis tools and machine
learning models that automatically update as additional data become available.
New data points are submitted through a simple web interface and automatically
processed using a nanoHUB Sim2L, which extracts derived quantities and indexes
all inputs and outputs in a FAIR data repository called ResultsDB. A separate
nanoHUB workflow enables sequential optimization using active learning, where
researchers define the optimization objective, and machine learning models are
trained on-the-fly with all existing data, guiding the selection of future
experiments. Inspired by the concept of ``frugal twin", the optimization task
seeks to find the optimal recipe to combine food dyes to achieve the desired
target color. With easily accessible and inexpensive materials, researchers and
students can set up their own experiments, share data with collaborators, and
explore the combination of FAIR data, predictive ML models, and sequential
optimization. The tools introduced are generally applicable and can easily be
extended to other optimization problems.

*Devin Y. De Silva,Sandareka Wickramanayake,Dulani Meedeniya,Sanka Rasnayaka*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEZ-HARN is a self-explainable zero-shot HAR model that recognizes unseen activities and provides skeleton videos for transparency, achieving competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of comprehensive datasets and transparency in existing HAR models, especially in zero-shot scenarios.

Method: Introduces SEZ-HARN, which recognizes untrained activities and explains decisions via skeleton videos. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets.

Result: SEZ-HARN matches black-box models in accuracy (within 3% on PAMAP2) while offering explainability.

Conclusion: SEZ-HARN balances accuracy and transparency, making it viable for real-world HAR applications.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses data from Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, has many practical applications in healthcare and assisted
living environments. However, its use in real-world scenarios has been limited
by the lack of comprehensive IMU-based HAR datasets that cover a wide range of
activities and the lack of transparency in existing HAR models. Zero-shot HAR
(ZS-HAR) overcomes the data limitations, but current models struggle to explain
their decisions, making them less transparent. This paper introduces a novel
IMU-based ZS-HAR model called the Self-Explainable Zero-shot Human Activity
Recognition Network (SEZ-HARN). It can recognize activities not encountered
during training and provide skeleton videos to explain its decision-making
process. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SEZ-HARN on four
benchmark datasets PAMAP2, DaLiAc, HTD-MHAD and MHealth and compare its
performance against three state-of-the-art black-box ZS-HAR models. The
experiment results demonstrate that SEZ-HARN produces realistic and
understandable explanations while achieving competitive Zero-shot recognition
accuracy. SEZ-HARN achieves a Zero-shot prediction accuracy within 3\% of the
best-performing black-box model on PAMAP2 while maintaining comparable
performance on the other three datasets.

*Shreyansh Padarha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AdvDistill improves knowledge distillation by using reward-guided dataset distillation, enhancing student model performance in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current knowledge distillation techniques limit student models by focusing on copying teacher responses, reducing generalizability and efficiency, especially in reasoning tasks.

Method: AdvDistill uses multiple teacher responses per prompt, assigns rewards via rule-based verifiers, and trains student models with weighted rewards.

Result: Significant performance improvement in student models for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset distillation enhances student model efficacy and generalizability.

Abstract: The push to compress and impart the proficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) into more deployable and efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) has
benefited from improvements in knowledge distillation (KD) techniques. These
techniques allow a smaller student model to learn from a more capable and
larger teacher model's responses. However, distillation often revolves around
the student model merely copying the teacher's in-distribution responses,
limiting its generalisability. This limitation is amplified on reasoning tasks
and can be computationally expensive. In this study, we propose AdvDistill, a
reward-guided dataset distillation framework. We utilise multiple generations
(responses) from a teacher for each prompt and assign rewards based on
rule-based verifiers. These varying and normally distributed rewards serve as
weights when training student models. Our methods and their subsequent
behavioural analysis demonstrate a significant improvement in student model
performance for mathematical and complex reasoning tasks, showcasing the
efficacy and benefits of incorporating a rewarding mechanism in dataset
distillation processes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces VoyagerVision, a multi-modal model for Minecraft that uses visual feedback to enhance spatial interpretation and task performance, outperforming its predecessor Voyager.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the open-ended potential of AGI by improving models' ability to interpret spatial environments through visual inputs, enabling more diverse tasks.

Method: Proposes VoyagerVision, a multi-modal model leveraging screenshots as visual feedback to create structures in Minecraft, building on Voyager.

Result: VoyagerVision created 2.75 unique structures in 50 iterations, a new capability, and succeeded in 50% of flat-world building tests.

Conclusion: Visual feedback enhances spatial task performance, demonstrating VoyagerVision's potential to expand open-ended AGI capabilities.

Abstract: Open-endedness is an active field of research in the pursuit of capable
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), allowing models to pursue tasks of their
own choosing. Simultaneously, recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as GPT-4o [9] have allowed such models to be capable of
interpreting image inputs. Implementations such as OMNI-EPIC [4] have made use
of such features, providing an LLM with pixel data of an agent's POV to parse
the environment and allow it to solve tasks. This paper proposes that providing
these visual inputs to a model gives it greater ability to interpret spatial
environments, and as such, can increase the number of tasks it can successfully
perform, extending its open-ended potential. To this aim, this paper proposes
VoyagerVision -- a multi-modal model capable of creating structures within
Minecraft using screenshots as a form of visual feedback, building on the
foundation of Voyager. VoyagerVision was capable of creating an average of 2.75
unique structures within fifty iterations of the system, as Voyager was
incapable of this, it is an extension in an entirely new direction.
Additionally, in a set of building unit tests VoyagerVision was successful in
half of all attempts in flat worlds, with most failures arising in more complex
structures. Project website is available at

*Basab Jha,Firoj Paudel,Ujjwal Puri,Zhang Yuting,Choi Donghyuk,Wang Junhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces inverse reasoning, a method for LLMs to decompose and explain their reasoning post-hoc, improving transparency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the blackbox nature of LLM decision-making and enhance interpretability in reasoning tasks.

Method: Uses inverse reasoning with a metacognitive structure (SAGE-nano) to reflect on and explain reasoning chains via attention processes.

Result: Achieves high reasoning accuracy (74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference), comparable to top models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Inverse reasoning improves LLM transparency and performance, advancing AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities at
solving complex reasoning tasks with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, but
their decision-making processes remain somewhat blackbox. We introduce
textbfinverse reasoning, a novel paradigm enabling LLMs to decompose and
explain their own reasoning chains post-hoc. Our approach, used in SAGE-nano, a
4-billion-parameter reasoning model, employs a metacognitive structure that
reflects back via attention processes to identify major decision points and
generate explanations of reasoning choices. While typical CoT approaches are
directed towards forward reasoning generation, inverse reasoning provides
insight into why specific reasoning chains were selected over others. Through
thorough testing of logical reasoning puzzles, math problems and ethical
dilemmas from AQUA-RAT, CommonsenseQA, and customized benchmarks, we
demonstrate that SAGE-nano is at the cutting edge both on reasoning accuracy
(74.6% on AQUA-RAT) and explanation quality (92.1% human preference score) for
its task, and offers performance almost on par with models like Claude-3.5
Sonnet or GPT-4o. Our contributions are: (i) the first rigorous framework for
LLM self-reflection via inverse reasoning, (ii) a novel metalearning framework
to reverse the attention flow, (iii) comprehensive evaluation frameworks for
reasoning transparency, and (iv) evidence that increasing reasoning using
inverse reasoning improves interpretability along with reasoning performance.
Our work creates new avenues for transparent AI systems and closes significant
gaps in AI safety, education, and scientific discovery.

TL;DR: A novel pipeline using RL and decision trees extracts interpretable decision logic from legacy systems, focusing on critical boundaries for accurate rule extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legacy systems lack documentation, making modernization difficult. Traditional methods like behavioral cloning fail to capture underlying intent.

Method: Uses an RL agent to explore input space, identify decision boundaries, and cluster counterfactual transitions. Decision trees then extract human-readable rules.

Result: Demonstrated on dummy systems, the RL agent effectively explores boundaries, and extracted rules accurately reflect core logic.

Conclusion: The pipeline provides a promising foundation for generating specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

Abstract: Modernizing legacy software systems is a critical but challenging task, often
hampered by a lack of documentation and understanding of the original system's
intricate decision logic. Traditional approaches like behavioral cloning merely
replicate input-output behavior without capturing the underlying intent. This
paper proposes a novel pipeline to automatically extract interpretable decision
logic from legacy systems treated as black boxes. The approach uses a
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to explore the input space and identify
critical decision boundaries by rewarding actions that cause meaningful changes
in the system's output. These counterfactual state transitions, where the
output changes, are collected and clustered using K-Means. Decision trees are
then trained on these clusters to extract human-readable rules that approximate
the system's decision logic near the identified boundaries. I demonstrated the
pipeline's effectiveness on three dummy legacy systems with varying complexity,
including threshold-based, combined-conditional, and non-linear range logic.
Results show that the RL agent successfully focuses exploration on relevant
boundary regions, and the extracted rules accurately reflect the core logic of
the underlying dummy systems, providing a promising foundation for generating
specifications and test cases during legacy migration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of generative AI tools on students' cognitive engagement during academic writing tasks.

Method: Experimental design with random assignment to AI-assisted (ChatGPT) or non-assisted (control) conditions, using a cognitive engagement scale (CES-AI) to measure mental effort, attention, deep processing, and strategic thinking.

Result: Lower cognitive engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group, indicating potential cognitive offloading.

Conclusion: AI assistance may compromise deep cognitive involvement; pedagogical strategies are needed to promote active engagement with AI-generated content.

Abstract: Despite the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in education,
concerns have emerged about their potential to reduce deep thinking and active
learning. This study investigates the impact of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) tools, specifically ChatGPT, on the cognitive engagement of
students during academic writing tasks. The study employed an experimental
design with participants randomly assigned to either an AI-assisted (ChatGPT)
or a non-assisted (control) condition. Participants completed a structured
argumentative writing task followed by a cognitive engagement scale (CES), the
CES-AI, developed to assess mental effort, attention, deep processing, and
strategic thinking. The results revealed significantly lower cognitive
engagement scores in the ChatGPT group compared to the control group. These
findings suggest that AI assistance may lead to cognitive offloading. The study
contributes to the growing body of literature on the psychological implications
of AI in education and raises important questions about the integration of such
tools into academic practice. It calls for pedagogical strategies that promote
active, reflective engagement with AI-generated content to avoid compromising
self-regulated learning and deep cognitive involvement of students.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address HAIM's limitations of task-agnostic data use and lack of explainability in AI for medicine.

Method: Leverages Generative AI in four steps: task-relevant data identification, patient summary generation, predictive modeling, and clinical explanations.

Result: Improved average AUC to 90.3% on chest pathology and operative tasks.

Conclusion: xHAIM transforms AI into an explainable clinical decision support system, enhancing utility for clinicians.

Abstract: With the increasing interest in deploying Artificial Intelligence in
medicine, we previously introduced HAIM (Holistic AI in Medicine), a framework
that fuses multimodal data to solve downstream clinical tasks. However, HAIM
uses data in a task-agnostic manner and lacks explainability. To address these
limitations, we introduce xHAIM (Explainable HAIM), a novel framework
leveraging Generative AI to enhance both prediction and explainability through
four structured steps: (1) automatically identifying task-relevant patient data
across modalities, (2) generating comprehensive patient summaries, (3) using
these summaries for improved predictive modeling, and (4) providing clinical
explanations by linking predictions to patient-specific medical knowledge.
Evaluated on the HAIM-MIMIC-MM dataset, xHAIM improves average AUC from 79.9%
to 90.3% across chest pathology and operative tasks. Importantly, xHAIM
transforms AI from a black-box predictor into an explainable decision support
system, enabling clinicians to interactively trace predictions back to relevant
patient data, bridging AI advancements with clinical utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact algorithms for NP-hard problems are computationally expensive, and heuristics lack optimality guarantees. ML offers potential improvements.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and improvement-based approaches.

Result: Provides a structured framework to guide future research and address emerging VRP variants.

Conclusion: ML can enhance traditional OR methods for routing problems, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: This paper reviews the current progress in applying machine learning (ML)
tools to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, with a focus on
routing problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and the vehicle
routing problem (VRP). Due to the inherent complexity of these problems, exact
algorithms often require excessive computational time to find optimal
solutions, while heuristics can only provide approximate solutions without
guaranteeing optimality. With the recent success of machine learning models,
there is a growing trend in proposing and implementing diverse ML techniques to
enhance the resolution of these challenging routing problems. We propose a
taxonomy categorizing ML-based routing methods into construction-based and
improvement-based approaches, highlighting their applicability to various
problem characteristics. This review aims to integrate traditional OR methods
with state-of-the-art ML techniques, providing a structured framework to guide

TL;DR: ASTRO is a framework that trains language models to reason like search algorithms using self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration, achieving significant performance gains on math problem-solving tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reasoning capabilities of non-reasoner models like Llama 3 by teaching structured search behavior derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).

Method: Uses synthetic datasets from MCTS to create natural language chain-of-thoughts, finetunes models on these traces, and improves performance via RL with verifiable rewards.

Result: Achieves absolute gains of 16.0% on MATH-500, 26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially on problems needing iterative correction.

Conclusion: Search-inspired training is a principled way to instill robust reasoning in open LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ASTRO, the "Autoregressive Search-Taught Reasoner", a framework
for training language models to reason like search algorithms, explicitly
leveraging self-reflection, backtracking, and exploration in their outputs.
Recently, training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL)
has led to the advent of reasoning models with greatly enhanced reasoning
capabilities. Open-source replications of reasoning models, while successful,
build upon models that already exhibit strong reasoning capabilities along with
search behavior observed even before RL. As a result, it is yet unclear how to
boost the reasoning capabilities of other non-reasoner models including Llama
3. ASTRO teaches such models to internalize structured search behavior through
a synthetic dataset derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) over
mathematical problem-solving trajectories. By converting search traces into
natural language chain-of-thoughts that capture both successes and recoveries
from failure, ASTRO bootstraps models with a rich prior for exploration during
RL. We finetune our models on these search-derived traces and further improve
performance via RL with verifiable rewards. We apply ASTRO to the Llama 3
family of models and achieve absolute performance gains of 16.0% on MATH-500,
26.9% on AMC 2023, and 20.0% on AIME 2024, especially improving upon
challenging problems that require iterative correction. Our results demonstrate
that search-inspired training offers a principled way to instill robust
reasoning capabilities into open LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Math reasoning in LLMs shows rapid progress, but gains may not transfer to other domains. RL-tuned models generalize better than SFT-tuned ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if improvements in math reasoning benchmarks reflect broader problem-solving ability or narrow overfitting.

Method: Evaluated 20+ reasoning-tuned models across diverse tasks (math, QA, planning, coding, instruction-following). Conducted controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models with math-only data and different tuning methods (RL vs. SFT).

Result: Most math-successful models fail in other domains. RL-tuned models generalize better; SFT-tuned models lose general capabilities due to representation and output drift.

Conclusion: SFT-distilled data may not be ideal for advancing reasoning models; RL-tuning preserves general-domain structure better.

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language
models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on
benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,
it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or
just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20
open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including
math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard
instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in
math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this
phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using
math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement
learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised
fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space
representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT
induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves
general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard
post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for
advancing reasoning models.

Motivation: To enhance local search efficiency for SMT-NRA by generalizing the cell-jump operation and integrating MCSAT with new techniques.

Method: Proposes 2d-cell-jump and 2d-LS framework, implements sample-cell projection for MCSAT, and designs a hybrid framework with OpenCAD.

Result: Experimental results show improved local search performance.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance search efficiency in SMT-NRA.

Abstract: In this paper, we advance local search for Satisfiability Modulo the Theory
of Nonlinear Real Arithmetic (SMT-NRA for short). First, we introduce a
two-dimensional cell-jump move, called \emph{$2d$-cell-jump}, generalizing the
key operation, cell-jump, of the local search method for SMT-NRA. Then, we
propose an extended local search framework, named \emph{$2d$-LS} (following the
local search framework, LS, for SMT-NRA), integrating the model constructing
satisfiability calculus (MCSAT) framework to improve search efficiency. To
further improve the efficiency of MCSAT, we implement a recently proposed
technique called \emph{sample-cell projection operator} for MCSAT, which is
well suited for CDCL-style search in the real domain and helps guide the search
away from conflicting states. Finally, we design a hybrid framework for SMT-NRA
combining MCSAT, $2d$-LS and OpenCAD, to improve search efficiency through
information exchange. The experimental results demonstrate improvements in
local search performance, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

TL;DR: RL for LLMs in chess shows promise with dense rewards but plateaus below expert levels due to pretrained model limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore if LLMs can develop strategic reasoning in chess using RL, leveraging dense rewards from a chess-pretrained network.

Method: Use a chess-pretrained action-value network for dense rewards (knowledge distillation) and compare with sparse binary rewards.

Result: Dense rewards outperform sparse ones, but models plateau below expert levels due to pretrained model deficits.

Conclusion: RL alone may not overcome LLMs' internal chess understanding deficits; pretrained model limitations are a key bottleneck.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown
promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL
remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic
reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a
chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's
output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our
experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform
sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below
expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and
find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained
models' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be
able to fully overcome.

TL;DR: The paper explores security risks in multimodal foundation model-driven agents, proposing a risk discrimination mechanism and automated assessment to mitigate jailbreak risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the increasing exposure of intelligent agents to jailbreak risks, where attackers bypass constraints to trigger unauthorized operations, highlighting gaps in existing security measures.

Method: Constructs a risk discrimination mechanism using behavioral sequence information and designs an automated assessment scheme leveraging large language models.

Result: Preliminary validation shows improved recognition of risky behaviors and reduced jailbreak probability in high-risk tasks.

Conclusion: The study offers valuable insights for security risk modeling and protection in multimodal intelligent agent systems.

Abstract: With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent
agent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant
interaction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large
model-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed
to potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the
original behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger
certain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing
unauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new
challenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent
agents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in
detecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations
or sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated
methodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is
currently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile
multimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by
incorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated
assisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary
validation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the
method can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist
in reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study
can provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and
protection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of current AI models in achieving AGI, emphasizing the need for modular reasoning, memory, and multi-agent coordination. It introduces Agentic RAG frameworks and discusses generalization strategies, VLMs, and the integration of memory and reasoning as key to AGI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between current AI capabilities and AGI by synthesizing insights from AI, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology, and proposing frameworks for adaptive, domain-agnostic intelligence.

Method: Cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, analyzing architectural and cognitive foundations, and proposing Agentic RAG frameworks, generalization strategies, and neurosymbolic systems.

Result: Identifies modular reasoning, memory integration, and multi-agent coordination as critical for AGI, and highlights the potential of Agentic RAG frameworks and VLMs.

Conclusion: AGI requires more than scale; it demands the integration of memory, reasoning, and adaptive frameworks, with ongoing challenges in science, technology, and ethics.

Abstract: Can machines truly think, reason and act in domains like humans? This
enduring question continues to shape the pursuit of Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI). Despite the growing capabilities of models such as GPT-4.5,
DeepSeek, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Phi-4, and Grok 3, which exhibit multimodal
fluency and partial reasoning, these systems remain fundamentally limited by
their reliance on token-level prediction and lack of grounded agency. This
paper offers a cross-disciplinary synthesis of AGI development, spanning
artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, generative models,
and agent-based systems. We analyze the architectural and cognitive foundations
of general intelligence, highlighting the role of modular reasoning, persistent
memory, and multi-agent coordination. In particular, we emphasize the rise of
Agentic RAG frameworks that combine retrieval, planning, and dynamic tool use
to enable more adaptive behavior. We discuss generalization strategies,
including information compression, test-time adaptation, and training-free
methods, as critical pathways toward flexible, domain-agnostic intelligence.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are reexamined not just as perception modules but
as evolving interfaces for embodied understanding and collaborative task
completion. We also argue that true intelligence arises not from scale alone
but from the integration of memory and reasoning: an orchestration of modular,
interactive, and self-improving components where compression enables adaptive
behavior. Drawing on advances in neurosymbolic systems, reinforcement learning,
and cognitive scaffolding, we explore how recent architectures begin to bridge
the gap between statistical learning and goal-directed cognition. Finally, we
identify key scientific, technical, and ethical challenges on the path to AGI.

*Dongyoon Hahm,Woogyeol Jin,June Suk Choi,Sungsoo Ahn,Kimin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CIP uses causal influence diagrams (CIDs) to improve safety in LLM-powered autonomous agents by modeling decision-making risks and refining behavior iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safe and reliable behavior of LLM-powered agents to prevent unintended consequences.

Method: Three-step approach: initialize CID for task, guide agent interactions using CID, and iteratively refine CID based on outcomes.

Result: Enhanced safety in code execution and mobile device control tasks.

Conclusion: CIP effectively mitigates risks in agent decision-making using CIDs.

Abstract: As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to
demonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and
reliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this
work, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence
diagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent
decision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect
relationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer
decisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID
based on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)
guiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)
iteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in
both code execution and mobile device control tasks.

*Ekaterina Borisova,Fabio Barth,Nils Feldhus,Raia Abu Ahmad,Malte Ostendorff,Pedro Ortiz Suarez,Georg Rehm,Sebastian Möller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' performance on table understanding tasks across domains and modalities, introducing the TableEval benchmark. Findings show robustness across modalities but challenges with scientific tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored efficiency of LLMs in processing tabular data, especially across different domains and modalities.

Method: Cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation of text-based and multimodal LLMs, including interpretability analysis and the introduction of the TableEval benchmark with 3017 tables in five formats.

Result: LLMs maintain robustness across table modalities but struggle with scientific tables.

Conclusion: While LLMs handle diverse table formats well, their performance on scientific tables needs improvement, highlighting a key area for future research.

Abstract: Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data
in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate
strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular
data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a
cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their
performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine
their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we
conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input
relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables
from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table
is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX.
Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table
modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.

### [120] [Prompting as Scientific Inquiry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00163)
*Ari Holtzman,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompting is a critical and scientifically valid method for studying and controlling large language models (LLMs), not just an unscientific workaround.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception of prompting as unscientific 'alchemy' and advocate for its recognition as a legitimate scientific approach to understanding LLMs.

Method: Argues by analogy, comparing prompting to behavioral science and mechanistic interpretability to neuroscience, emphasizing language as the native interface for LLMs.

Result: Positions prompting as a fundamental and irreplaceable component in the study of LLMs, akin to behavioral science for organisms.

Conclusion: Prompting should be embraced as a key scientific tool for probing and understanding LLMs, not dismissed as unscientific.

Abstract: Prompting is the primary method by which we study and control large language
models. It is also one of the most powerful: nearly every major capability
attributed to LLMs-few-shot learning, chain-of-thought, constitutional AI-was
first unlocked through prompting. Yet prompting is rarely treated as science
and is frequently frowned upon as alchemy. We argue that this is a category
error. If we treat LLMs as a new kind of complex and opaque organism that is
trained rather than programmed, then prompting is not a workaround: it is
behavioral science. Mechanistic interpretability peers into the neural
substrate, prompting probes the model in its native interface: language. We
contend that prompting is not inferior, but rather a key component in the
science of LLMs.

### [121] [LineRetriever: Planning-Aware Observation Reduction for Web Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00210)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LineRetriever, a method to optimize retrieval for adaptive planning in web navigation by focusing on plan-relevant information, reducing observation size without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval methods lose critical information for adaptive planning in web agents, as they don't account for the planning horizon or action prediction.

Method: LineRetriever uses a language model to retrieve observation lines relevant to future navigation steps, prioritizing elements for action prediction.

Result: Experiments show LineRetriever reduces observation size while maintaining performance within context limits.

Conclusion: LineRetriever effectively addresses the challenge of optimizing retrieval for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks.

Abstract: While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in web
navigation tasks, the extensive context of web pages, often represented as DOM
or Accessibility Tree (AxTree) structures, frequently exceeds model context
limits. Current approaches like bottom-up truncation or embedding-based
retrieval lose critical information about page state and action history. This
is particularly problematic for adaptive planning in web agents, where
understanding the current state is essential for determining future actions. We
hypothesize that embedding models lack sufficient capacity to capture
plan-relevant information, especially when retrieving content that supports
future action prediction. This raises a fundamental question: how can retrieval
methods be optimized for adaptive planning in web navigation tasks? In
response, we introduce \textit{LineRetriever}, a novel approach that leverages
a language model to identify and retrieve observation lines most relevant to
future navigation steps. Unlike traditional retrieval methods that focus solely
on semantic similarity, \textit{LineRetriever} explicitly considers the
planning horizon, prioritizing elements that contribute to action prediction.
Our experiments demonstrate that \textit{LineRetriever} can reduce the size of
the observation at each step for the web agent while maintaining consistent
performance within the context limitations.

*Mads Henrichsen,Rasmus Krebs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage method using LLM-generated reasoning improves text classification performance and interpretability, showing an 8.7% accuracy boost in emotion classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard models lack explicit reasoning, limiting performance and interpretability. This work aims to enhance classification by incorporating LLM-generated reasoning.

Method: 1. Fine-tune Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct to generate reasoning (R) from Q&A. 2. Use this to augment training data for a downstream model predicting R and label (A).

Result: The model (Q->RA) outperforms the baseline (Q->A) by 8.7% in accuracy on emotion classification.

Conclusion: LLM-generated reasoning enriches training data, improving downstream task performance and providing interpretability.

Abstract: Standard classification models often map inputs directly to labels without
explicit reasoning, potentially limiting their performance, robustness, and
interpretability. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance
text classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated
reasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model
(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset
(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and
its answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used
offline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative
model. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the
input text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately
followed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the
dair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that
the generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier
Q->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy
(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely
to output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization
capabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning
training. This work underscores the potential of LLM-generated reasonings for
creating richer training datasets, thereby improving the performance of diverse
downstream NLP tasks and providing explicit explanations.

### [123] [Towards Style Alignment in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00216)
*Shreya Havaldar,Adam Stein,Eric Wong,Lyle Ungar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RASTA improves LLM translation by aligning speaker and listener styles, addressing cultural misalignment biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cultural differences often cause misalignment in communication styles, especially in non-Western languages, leading to ineffective translations.

Method: RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic Alignment) uses learned stylistic concepts to align LLM translations with cultural norms.

Result: RASTA mitigates biases towards neutrality and improves style alignment in translations, especially for non-Western languages.

Conclusion: RASTA effectively addresses style misalignment in LLM translations, enhancing cross-cultural communication.

Abstract: Successful communication depends on the speaker's intended style (i.e., what
the speaker is trying to convey) aligning with the listener's interpreted style
(i.e., what the listener perceives). However, cultural differences often lead
to misalignment between the two; for example, politeness is often lost in
translation. We characterize the ways that LLMs fail to translate style -
biasing translations towards neutrality and performing worse in non-Western
languages. We mitigate these failures with RASTA (Retrieval-Augmented STylistic
Alignment), a method that leverages learned stylistic concepts to encourage LLM
translation to appropriately convey cultural communication norms and align
style.

### [124] [Linearly Decoding Refused Knowledge in Aligned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00239)
*Aryan Shrivastava,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Linear probes on LM hidden states reveal that refused harmful information remains accessible and influential despite instruction-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether harmful information refused by instruction-tuned LMs is still decodable and influential in their internal representations.

Method: Use linear probes trained on hidden states of LMs to decode refused information and analyze transferability between base and instruction-tuned models.

Result: Harmful information is linearly decodable (e.g., Pearson correlations >0.8) and persists from base to instruction-tuned models, influencing downstream behavior.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning suppresses but does not eliminate harmful information, leaving it accessible and indirectly influential.

Abstract: Most commonly used language models (LMs) are instruction-tuned and aligned
using a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, causing them to
refuse users requests deemed harmful by the model. However, jailbreak prompts
can often bypass these refusal mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. In this
work, we study the extent to which information accessed via jailbreak prompts
is decodable using linear probes trained on LM hidden states. We show that a
great deal of initially refused information is linearly decodable. For example,
across models, the response of a jailbroken LM for the average IQ of a country
can be predicted by a linear probe with Pearson correlations exceeding $0.8$.
Surprisingly, we find that probes trained on base models (which do not refuse)
sometimes transfer to their instruction-tuned versions and are capable of
revealing information that jailbreaks decode generatively, suggesting that the
internal representations of many refused properties persist from base LMs
through instruction-tuning. Importantly, we show that this information is not
merely "leftover" in instruction-tuned models, but is actively used by them: we
find that probe-predicted values correlate with LM generated pairwise
comparisons, indicating that the information decoded by our probes align with
suppressed generative behavior that may be expressed more subtly in other
downstream tasks. Overall, our results suggest that instruction-tuning does not
wholly eliminate or even relocate harmful information in representation
space-they merely suppress its direct expression, leaving it both linearly
accessible and indirectly influential in downstream behavior.

*Isabella Senturia,Matilde Marcolli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A mathematical model of the morphology-syntax interface is presented, using magma and operad theory to describe word formation and morphosyntactic tree construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the interface between morphology and syntax within the Strong Minimalist Thesis, addressing the lack of movement in morphology compared to syntax.

Method: Uses a magma of morphological trees and operad theory to model the coproduct decomposition and morphosyntactic tree formation.

Result: A framework for describing morphosyntactic trees via operadic correspondence and transformations, reinterpreting Distributed Morphology operations.

Conclusion: The model provides a flexible boundary between syntax and morphology, formalizing their interaction mathematically.

Abstract: Within the context of the mathematical formulation of Merge and the Strong
Minimalist Thesis, we present a mathematical model of the morphology-syntax
interface. In this setting, morphology has compositional properties responsible
for word formation, organized into a magma of morphological trees. However,
unlike syntax, we do not have movement within morphology. A coproduct
decomposition exists, but it requires extending the set of morphological trees
beyond those which are generated solely by the magma, to a larger set of
possible morphological inputs to syntactic trees. These participate in the
formation of morphosyntactic trees as an algebra over an operad, and a
correspondence between algebras over an operad. The process of structure
formation for morphosyntactic trees can then be described in terms of this
operadic correspondence that pairs syntactic and morphological data and the
morphology coproduct. We reinterpret in this setting certain operations of
Distributed Morphology as transformation that allow for flexibility in moving
the boundary between syntax and morphology within the morphosyntactic objects.

TL;DR: Non-English languages can be more token-efficient for reasoning in LRMs, preserving accuracy and showing genuine shifts in reasoning behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if English is the most token-efficient language for reasoning in LRMs, given their multilingual pretraining.

Method: Evaluated three open-source RLMs (DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5, Qwen 3) across four math datasets and seven diverse languages.

Result: Non-English reasoning reduces token usage and maintains accuracy, with gains persisting even after translation. Improvement depends on model multilingual strength.

Conclusion: Multilingual reasoning offers potential, emphasizing the need for strong multilingual foundations in LRMs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Language Reasoning Models (LRMs), most research
focuses solely on English, even though many models are pretrained on
multilingual data. In this work, we investigate: Is English the most
token-efficient language for reasoning? We evaluate three open-source RLMs:
DeepSeek R1, Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3, across four math datasets and seven
typologically diverse languages. We find that reasoning in non-English
languages not only reduces token usage, but also preserves accuracy. These
gains persist even after translating the reasoning traces into English,
suggesting genuine shifts in reasoning behavior rather than surface-level
linguistic effects. The extent of improvement, however, depends on the models
multilingual strength. Our findings motivate a broader view of reasoning in
language models, highlighting the potential of multilingual reasoning and the
importance of strong multilingual foundations. The code for our work can be

*Jie Hou,Chuxiong Wu,Lannan Luo,Qiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt-based fine-tuning is more privacy-preserving than parameter-based fine-tuning, showing lower vulnerability to membership inference attacks (MIAs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the privacy risks of memorization in fine-tuning LLMs, which are often overlooked.

Method: Categorize fine-tuning approaches and evaluate their memorization impact using MIAs.

Result: Prompt-based fine-tuning performs competitively and is less vulnerable to MIAs, regardless of model scale.

Conclusion: Parameter-based fine-tuning leaks more private data, making prompt-based methods a better privacy-preserving choice.

Abstract: As the capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) continue to
advance, the "pre-train and fine-tune" paradigm has become increasingly
mainstream, leading to the development of various fine-tuning methods. However,
the privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received
relatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular
fine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens
of membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to
parameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive
performance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,
prompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale. These
findings suggest that parameter-based fine-tuning is more prone to leaking
private information, whereas prompt-based fine-tuning serves as a more
privacy-preserving option.

TL;DR: The dissertation addresses challenges in NLP for low-resource African languages, focusing on data quality, multilingual PLMs, and creating annotated datasets for tasks like NER and MT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve NLP performance for underrepresented African languages by addressing data scarcity, noise, and lack of labeled datasets.

Method: Analyzed noisy corpora, curated high-quality data, adapted multilingual PLMs, and created annotated datasets for 21 African languages. Evaluated using state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Showed that data quality impacts word embeddings, multilingual PLMs benefit low-resource languages, and annotated datasets improve task performance.

Conclusion: High-quality data and adapted PLMs can enhance NLP for low-resource African languages, addressing under-representation in research.

Abstract: Recent advances in word embeddings and language models use large-scale,
unlabelled data and self-supervised learning to boost NLP performance.
Multilingual models, often trained on web-sourced data like Wikipedia, face
challenges: few low-resource languages are included, their data is often noisy,
and lack of labeled datasets makes it hard to evaluate performance outside
high-resource languages like English. In this dissertation, we focus on
languages spoken in Sub-Saharan Africa where all the indigenous languages in
this region can be regarded as low-resourced in terms of the availability of
labelled data for NLP tasks and unlabelled data found on the web. We analyse
the noise in the publicly available corpora, and curate a high-quality corpus,
demonstrating that the quality of semantic representations learned in word
embeddings does not only depend on the amount of data but on the quality of
pre-training data. We demonstrate empirically the limitations of word
embeddings, and the opportunities the multilingual pre-trained language model
(PLM) offers especially for languages unseen during pre-training and
low-resource scenarios. We further study how to adapt and specialize
multilingual PLMs to unseen African languages using a small amount of
monolingual texts. To address the under-representation of the African languages
in NLP research, we developed large scale human-annotated labelled datasets for
21 African languages in two impactful NLP tasks: named entity recognition and
machine translation. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation using
state-of-the-art methods across supervised, weakly-supervised, and transfer
learning settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMs struggle with syntactic tasks like balanced parentheses due to unreliable components. RASteer, a steering method, improves accuracy by boosting reliable components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate persistent syntactic errors in LMs, despite their advanced coding capabilities.

Method: Analyze LM components (attention heads, FF neurons) to identify reliable vs. faulty mechanisms. Introduce RASteer to enhance reliable components.

Result: RASteer boosts balanced parentheses accuracy from 0% to ~100% and improves arithmetic reasoning by ~20%.

Conclusion: Targeting reliable components with RASteer effectively mitigates LM errors without harming general performance.

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in coding capabilities, language models (LMs)
still struggle with simple syntactic tasks such as generating balanced
parentheses. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanisms behind the
persistence of these errors across LMs of varying sizes (124M-7B) to both
understand and mitigate the errors. Our study reveals that LMs rely on a number
of components (attention heads and FF neurons) that independently make their
own predictions. While some components reliably promote correct answers across
a generalized range of inputs (i.e., implementing "sound mechanisms''), others
are less reliable and introduce noise by promoting incorrect tokens (i.e.,
implementing "faulty mechanisms''). Errors occur when the faulty mechanisms
overshadow the sound ones and dominantly affect the predictions. Motivated by
this insight, we introduce RASteer, a steering method to systematically
identify and increase the contribution of reliable components for improving
model performance. RASteer substantially improves performance on balanced
parentheses tasks, boosting accuracy of some models from $0$% to around $100$%
without impairing the models' general coding ability. We further demonstrate
its broader applicability in arithmetic reasoning tasks, achieving performance
gains of up to around $20$%.

*Mohna Chakraborty,Adithya Kulkarni,Qi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COLDSELECT improves prompt-based methods by jointly selecting verbalizers and instances, optimizing for diversity and minimal uncertainty in cold-start settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are sensitive to templates, verbalizers, and instance selection, especially in cold-start scenarios with no labeled data. The dependency between instances and verbalizers is often overlooked.

Method: COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and embeddings into a shared space, applies dimensionality reduction and clustering, and optimizes for diversity and minimal uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on eight benchmarks show COLDSELECT outperforms baselines in reducing uncertainty and improving generalization.

Conclusion: COLDSELECT effectively addresses cold-start challenges by jointly optimizing verbalizer and instance selection, enhancing performance in prompt-based methods.

Abstract: Prompt-based methods leverage the knowledge of pre-trained language models
(PLMs) trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) objective; however, these
methods are sensitive to template, verbalizer, and few-shot instance selection,
particularly in cold-start settings with no labeled data. Existing studies
overlook the dependency between instances and verbalizers, where instance-label
probabilities depend on verbalizer token proximity in the embedding space. To
address this, we propose COLDSELECT, a joint verbalizer and instance selection
approach that models data diversity. COLDSELECT maps PLM vocabulary and
$h_{[MASK]}$ embeddings into a shared space, applying dimensionality reduction
and clustering to ensure efficient and diverse selection. By optimizing for
minimal uncertainty and maximal diversity, COLDSELECT captures data
relationships effectively. Experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate
COLDSELECT's superiority in reducing uncertainty and enhancing generalization,
outperforming baselines in verbalizer and few-shot instance selection for
cold-start scenarios.

*Paul J. L. Ammann,Jonas Golde,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing RAG for multi-hop questions by decomposing queries into sub-questions, retrieving and reranking passages, improving retrieval and answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG struggles with multi-hop questions due to distributed facts across documents.

Method: Decompose queries into sub-questions, retrieve passages for each, merge and rerank them.

Result: Improves retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy (F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG.

Conclusion: Question decomposition and reranking enhance RAG for multi-hop questions without extra training.

Abstract: Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a
well-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like
question answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the
question and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop
questions, such as "Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the
biggest profit in 2023?," challenge RAG because relevant facts are often
distributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,
making it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To
address this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question
decomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,
(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged
candidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the
retrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles
complementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most
relevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is
standard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with
LLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop
questions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra
training or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG
and HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy
(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.

*Vojtěch Lanz,Jan Hajič jr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores Gregorian chant melodies using unsupervised segmentation with Pitman-Yor models, achieving top mode classification results. It links memory efficiency to mode classification but finds the segmentation doesn't fully align with centonisation theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if an optimal segmentation of Gregorian chant melodies, inspired by memorization, can validate or refute the centonisation theory.

Method: Uses nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language models for unsupervised segmentation of chant melodies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art mode classification performance and identifies memory-efficient segmentations, though they don't match centonisation expectations.

Conclusion: Memory-optimal segmentations exist but don't fully support centonisation, highlighting practical modality roles in chant performance.

Abstract: The idea that Gregorian melodies are constructed from some vocabulary of
segments has long been a part of chant scholarship. This so-called
"centonisation" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent
re-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the
intractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some
undiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of
centonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can
outperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the
fact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised
segmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language
models. The segmentation we find achieves state-of-the-art performance in mode
classification. Modeling a monk memorising the melodies from one liturgical
manuscript, we then find empirical evidence for the link between mode
classification and memory efficiency, and observe more formulaic areas at the
beginnings and ends of melodies corresponding to the practical role of modality
in performance. However, the resulting segmentations themselves indicate that
even such a memory-optimal segmentation is not what is understood as
centonisation.

*Jing Ren,Wenhao Zhou,Bowen Li,Mujie Liu,Nguyen Linh Dan Le,Jiade Cen,Liping Chen,Ziqi Xu,Xiwei Xu,Xiaodong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAPITAL is a causal prompting framework for Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) that improves accuracy and robustness by integrating front-door adjustment into chain-of-thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting-based methods for ISA rely on majority voting over reasoning paths without evaluating causal validity, leading to biases and spurious correlations.

Method: CAPITAL decomposes causal effects into prompt influence on reasoning chains and their impact on output, using encoder-based clustering, NWGM approximation, and contrastive learning.

Result: CAPITAL outperforms baselines in accuracy and robustness on ISA datasets, especially under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: CAPITAL provides a principled, bias-aware approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting for sentiment reasoning.

Abstract: Implicit Sentiment Analysis (ISA) aims to infer sentiment that is implied
rather than explicitly stated, requiring models to perform deeper reasoning
over subtle contextual cues. While recent prompting-based methods using Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in ISA, they often rely on majority
voting over chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paths without evaluating their
causal validity, making them susceptible to internal biases and spurious
correlations. To address this challenge, we propose CAPITAL, a causal prompting
framework that incorporates front-door adjustment into CoT reasoning. CAPITAL
decomposes the overall causal effect into two components: the influence of the
input prompt on the reasoning chains, and the impact of those chains on the
final output. These components are estimated using encoder-based clustering and
the NWGM approximation, with a contrastive learning objective used to better
align the encoder's representation with the LLM's reasoning space. Experiments
on benchmark ISA datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that CAPITAL consistently
outperforms strong prompting baselines in both accuracy and robustness,
particularly under adversarial conditions. This work offers a principled
approach to integrating causal inference into LLM prompting and highlights its
benefits for bias-aware sentiment reasoning. The source code and case study are

*Gauri Kambhatla,Sanjana Gautam,Angela Zhang,Alex Liu,Ravi Srinivasan,Junyi Jessy Li,Matthew Lease*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Simple supervision improves language model alignment with diverse groups, evaluated across datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of subjective answers across population groups is valuable.

Method: Uses simple supervision to align language models with diverse groups, tested on three datasets.

Result: Improved alignment with diverse groups; performance varies by group. Approach is simple and general.

Conclusion: Provides a benchmark for future research; guidance on when to use the approach.

Abstract: The ability to accurately predict how different population groups would
answer subjective questions would have great value. In this work, we show that
use of relatively simple supervision can greatly improve language model
alignment with diverse population groups, as measured over three datasets
spanning various topics. Beyond evaluating average performance, we also report
how alignment varies across specific groups. The simplicity and generality of
our approach promotes easy adoption, while our broad findings provide useful
guidance for when to use or not use our approach in practice. By conducting
evaluation over many LLMs and prompting strategies, along with open-sourcing
our work, we provide a useful benchmark to stimulate future research.

*Md. Najib Hasan,Mohammad Fakhruddin Babar,Souvika Sarkar,Monowar Hasan,Santu Karmaker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Open LLM benchmarks like HELM and BIG-bench enable fair LM comparisons but have pitfalls. This study shows how 'cheating' models can exploit them, highlighting the need for better benchmarking practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose weaknesses in open LLM benchmarks by demonstrating how models can exploit public test sets for high rankings without real-world utility.

Method: Constructed smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned on public test sets to 'cheat' on HELM.

Result: Cheating models achieved top rankings on HELM despite poor generalization, revealing flaws in open benchmarks.

Conclusion: Open benchmarks alone are insufficient; private/dynamic benchmarks and reevaluation of practices are needed for robust LM assessments.

Abstract: Open Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks, such as HELM and BIG-bench, offer
standardized, transparent protocols that facilitate the fair comparison,
reproducibility, and iterative advancement of Language Models (LMs). However,
their openness also introduces critical and underexplored pitfalls. This study
exposes these weaknesses by systematically constructing ``cheating'' models --
smaller variants of BART, T5, and GPT-2 fine-tuned directly on public test sets
-- which achieve top rankings on a prominent open, holistic benchmark (HELM)
despite poor generalization and limited practical utility. Our findings
underscore three key insights: \ca high leaderboard performance on open
benchmarks may not always reflect real-world effectiveness; \cb private or
dynamic benchmarks must complement open evaluations to safeguard integrity; and
\cc a fundamental reevaluation of current benchmarking practices is essential
to ensure robust and trustworthy LM assessments.

*To Eun Kim,João Coelho,Gbemileke Onilude,Jai Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular pipeline for managing ads in RAG-based conversational systems, focusing on seamless integration and robust detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The blurring of boundaries between ads and informational content in generative systems raises transparency and trust concerns.

Method: A pipeline with an ad-rewriter and ad-classifier, trained on synthetic data, is used for ad integration and detection. Two strategies are tested: supervised fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling.

Result: The ad-classifier performs robustly, and classifier-guided optimization improves ad stealth.

Conclusion: The work contributes an adversarial co-evolution framework for ad-aware generative systems and robust classifiers.

Abstract: As conversational search engines increasingly adopt generation-based
paradigms powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG), the integration of advertisements into generated responses
presents both commercial opportunities and challenges for user experience.
Unlike traditional search, where advertisements are clearly delineated,
generative systems blur the boundary between informational content and
promotional material, raising concerns around transparency and trust. In this
work, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based
conversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad
integration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic
data to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two
complementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the
ad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable
ad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two
core questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad
integration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,
minimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our
ad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing
strategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,
through both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad
stealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an
adversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware
generative search systems and robust ad classifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Nirantar is a framework for evaluating continual learning in multilingual and multi-domain ASR, using real-world data from 22 languages and 208 districts in India. It introduces novel scenarios and highlights the inconsistency of current CL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address real-world continual learning challenges in multilingual and multi-domain ASR, as prior work relied on simulated episodes.

Method: Leverages incrementally collected data across languages and domains, introducing Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL), and LIDIL scenarios.

Result: Evaluation shows no single CL method performs consistently well, indicating the need for more robust strategies.

Conclusion: Nirantar provides a dynamic, real-world testbed for CL research, revealing gaps in current methods.

Abstract: We introduce Nirantar, a comprehensive framework for evaluating continual
learning (CL) in multilingual and multi-domain ASR. Designed to reflect
real-world CL challenges, Nirantar leverages data collected incrementally
across 22 languages and 208 districts in India through natural episodes. This
enables evaluation across Language-Incremental (LIL), Domain-Incremental (DIL),
and the novel Language-Incremental Domain-Incremental Learning (LIDIL)
scenarios. Unlike prior work that relies on simulated episodes, Nirantar
presents dynamic, non-uniform language and domain shifts, making it an ideal
testbed for CL research. With 3250 hours of human-transcribed speech, including
1720 hours newly introduced in this work, our framework enables systematic
benchmarking of CL methods. We evaluate existing approaches and demonstrate
that no single method performs consistently well, underscoring the need for
more robust CL strategies.

*Shixiao Wang,Yifan Zhuang,Runsheng Zhang,Zhijun Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Capsule Network-based algorithm improves intent recognition accuracy in human-computer interaction by modeling semantic intent hierarchically and using dynamic routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing insufficient accuracy in intent recognition for human-computer interaction.

Method: Uses vectorized capsule structures, dynamic routing, and a convolutional feature extraction module to model semantic intent hierarchically. Introduces a margin-based loss function for better class distinction.

Result: Outperforms traditional and deep learning methods in accuracy, F1-score, and intent detection rate. Analyzes dynamic routing iterations and loss convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed method is stable and effective for semantic modeling, improving intent recognition under complex conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a user semantic intent modeling algorithm based on
Capsule Networks to address the problem of insufficient accuracy in intent
recognition for human-computer interaction. The method represents semantic
features in input text through a vectorized capsule structure. It uses a
dynamic routing mechanism to transfer information across multiple capsule
layers. This helps capture hierarchical relationships and part-whole structures
between semantic entities more effectively. The model uses a convolutional
feature extraction module as the low-level encoder. After generating initial
semantic capsules, it forms high-level abstract intent representations through
an iterative routing process. To further enhance performance, a margin-based
mechanism is introduced into the loss function. This improves the model's
ability to distinguish between intent classes. Experiments are conducted using
a public natural language understanding dataset. Multiple mainstream models are
used for comparison. Results show that the proposed model outperforms
traditional methods and other deep learning structures in terms of accuracy,
F1-score, and intent detection rate. The study also analyzes the effect of the
number of dynamic routing iterations on model performance. A convergence curve
of the loss function during training is provided. These results verify the
stability and effectiveness of the proposed method in semantic modeling.
Overall, this study presents a new structured modeling approach to improve
intent recognition under complex semantic conditions.

Motivation: The opacity and lack of transparency in advanced computational algorithms undermine trust in research, necessitating methodological guidance.

Method: The author illustrates the application of structural topic modelling and presents guidelines for ensuring rigour in such studies.

Result: Guidelines are proposed for topic modelling, adaptable to other algorithms, aiding novice researchers, editors, and reviewers.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to topic modelling literature and the broader discourse on methodological rigour in computationally intensive research.

Abstract: The rise of advanced computational algorithms has opened new avenues for
computationally intensive research approaches to theory development. However,
the opacity of these algorithms and lack of transparency and rigour in their
application pose methodological challenges, potentially undermining trust in
research. The discourse on methodological rigour in this new genre of research
is still emerging. Against this backdrop, I attempt to offer guidance on
methodological rigour, particularly in the context of topic modelling
algorithms. By illustrating the application of the structural topic modelling
algorithm and presenting a set of guidelines, I discuss how to ensure rigour in
topic modelling studies. Although the guidelines are for the application of
topic modelling algorithms, they can be applied to other algorithms with
context-specific adjustments. The guidelines are helpful, especially for novice
researchers applying topic modelling, and editors and reviewers handling topic
modelling manuscripts. I contribute to the literature on topic modelling and
join the emerging dialogue on methodological rigour in computationally
intensive theory construction research.

TL;DR: The paper addresses LLM hallucinations, especially in multilingual contexts, proposing a retrieval and BERT-based pipeline for detection, achieving top-10 results in eight languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs reduce trustworthiness, but research often overlooks multilingual data. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: A two-part pipeline: retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia and a BERT-based system fine-tuned for hallucination patterns.

Result: Competitive performance, top-10 in eight languages, including English, and supports more languages than the task required.

Conclusion: The multilingual hallucination identifier can enhance LLM outputs and their future utility.

Abstract: Hallucinations are one of the major problems of LLMs, hindering their
trustworthiness and deployment to wider use cases. However, most of the
research on hallucinations focuses on English data, neglecting the multilingual
nature of LLMs. This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2025 Task-3
- Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related
Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. We propose a two-part pipeline that
combines retrieval-based fact verification against Wikipedia with a BERT-based
system fine-tuned to identify common hallucination patterns. Our system
achieves competitive results across all languages, reaching top-10 results in
eight languages, including English. Moreover, it supports multiple languages
beyond the fourteen covered by the shared task. This multilingual hallucination
identifier can help to improve LLM outputs and their usefulness in the future.

TL;DR: A unified framework enhances transfer and adaptation of large language models in low-resource scenarios using knowledge alignment and soft prompt tuning, improving performance and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of large language models in low-resource language scenarios.

Method: Combines knowledge transfer with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, using knowledge alignment loss and soft prompt tuning, alongside lightweight adaptation modules.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in cross-lingual tasks like MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X, especially in data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: The method improves adaptability and preserves general capabilities, making it suitable for multilingual and complex semantic tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of
large language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified
framework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient
fine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft
prompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural
features of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances
both generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes
lightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,
it integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's
original knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also
conducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer
experiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and
robustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that
compared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer
methods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on
cross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates
particularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The
proposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances
task-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large
language models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and
multilingual processing tasks.

TL;DR: MoR is a framework embedding diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs, eliminating the need for task-specific prompts and improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs rely on manually crafted prompts, limiting adaptability and efficiency.

Method: MoR involves Thought Generation (creating reasoning templates) and SFT Dataset Construction (pairing templates with datasets for fine-tuning).

Result: MoR improves performance, e.g., 2.2% with CoT and 13.5% over baselines.

Conclusion: MoR offers a generalizable solution for autonomous, task-adaptive reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in complex tasks through advanced
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning.Our experiments show that MoR significantly enhances
performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT prompting
and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates the need
for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for robust

TL;DR: SAFER is a framework using Sparse Autoencoders to interpret and improve reward models in RLHF, enabling insights into safety-relevant decisions and targeted data modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models in RLHF are opaque; SAFER aims to interpret and refine them for better alignment with human values.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoders to analyze reward model activations, identify safety-relevant features, and apply targeted data poisoning/denoising.

Result: SAFER precisely degrades or enhances safety alignment with minimal data changes, without harming general performance.

Conclusion: SAFER advances reward model interpretation, auditing, and refinement for high-stakes LLM alignment tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a key paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, yet the reward models
at its core remain largely opaque. In this work, we present sparse Autoencoder
For Enhanced Reward model (\textbf{SAFER}), a novel framework for interpreting
and improving reward models through mechanistic analysis. Leveraging Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we uncover human-interpretable features in reward model
activations, enabling insight into safety-relevant decision-making. We apply
SAFER to safety-oriented preference datasets and quantify the salience of
individual features by activation differences between chosen and rejected
responses. Using these feature-level signals, we design targeted data poisoning
and denoising strategies. Experiments show that SAFER can precisely degrade or
enhance safety alignment with minimal data modification, without sacrificing
general chat performance. Our approach contributes to interpreting, auditing
and refining reward models in high-stakes LLM alignment tasks. Our codes are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs trained on Japanese and English exhibit culturally grounded attentional patterns, mirroring holistic (East Asian) and analytic (Western) tendencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if VLMs reflect cultural differences in visual information processing, akin to human cross-cultural cognition.

Method: Comparative analysis of image descriptions generated by VLMs trained on Japanese (holistic) and English (analytic) languages.

Result: VLMs reproduce cultural behaviors from training data, showing holistic vs. analytic tendencies.

Conclusion: Cultural cognition implicitly shapes VLM outputs, suggesting models internalize cultural patterns.

Abstract: Cross-cultural research in perception and cognition has shown that
individuals from different cultural backgrounds process visual information in
distinct ways. East Asians, for example, tend to adopt a holistic perspective,
attending to contextual relationships, whereas Westerners often employ an
analytical approach, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. In
this study, we investigate whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained
predominantly on different languages, specifically Japanese and English,
exhibit similar culturally grounded attentional patterns. Using comparative
analysis of image descriptions, we examine whether these models reflect
differences in holistic versus analytic tendencies. Our findings suggest that
VLMs not only internalize the structural properties of language but also
reproduce cultural behaviors embedded in the training data, indicating that
cultural cognition may implicitly shape model outputs.

Motivation: To leverage LLMs for generating coherent and informative financial reports from time series data, while assessing their factual grounding and reasoning capabilities.

Method: A framework combining prompt engineering, model selection, and evaluation, with an automated highlighting system to categorize insights (data-derived, financial reasoning, or external knowledge).

Result: Experiments show LLMs can produce coherent and informative financial reports, validated on real stock market indices and synthetic time series.

Conclusion: LLMs are effective for financial report generation, with the proposed framework aiding in evaluating their capabilities.

Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate
financial reports from time series data. We propose a framework encompassing
prompt engineering, model selection, and evaluation. We introduce an automated
highlighting system to categorize information within the generated reports,
differentiating between insights derived directly from time series data,
stemming from financial reasoning, and those reliant on external knowledge.
This approach aids in evaluating the factual grounding and reasoning

TL;DR: LitBench is introduced as a standardized benchmark for evaluating creative writing by LLMs, showing Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the best OTS judge and trained reward models outperforming OTS judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-ended creative writing lacks ground truths, making evaluation challenging. Current OTS LLM judges are unreliable, necessitating a robust benchmark.

Method: LitBench includes a dataset of human-labeled story comparisons. It benchmarks zero-shot LLM judges, trains reward models (Bradley-Terry and generative), and validates rankings via a human study.

Result: Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves 73% agreement with humans; trained reward models reach 78% accuracy, outperforming OTS judges. Human study confirms alignment with preferences.

Conclusion: LitBench provides a reliable resource for automated evaluation and optimization of creative writing systems, with trained models aligning well with human judgments.

Abstract: Evaluating creative writing generated by large language models (LLMs) remains
challenging because open-ended narratives lack ground truths. Without
performant automated evaluation methods, off-the-shelf (OTS) language models
are employed as zero-shot judges, yet their reliability is unclear in this
context. In pursuit of robust evaluation for creative writing, we introduce
LitBench, the first standardized benchmark and paired dataset for creative
writing verification, comprising a held-out test set of 2,480 debiased,
human-labeled story comparisons drawn from Reddit and a 43,827-pair training
corpus of human preference labels. Using LitBench, we (i) benchmark zero-shot
LLM judges, (ii) train Bradley Terry and generative reward models, and (iii)
conduct an online human study to validate reward model rankings on newly
LLM-generated stories. Our benchmark identifies Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the
strongest off-the-shelf judge, reaching 73% agreement with human preferences;
among trained reward models, Bradley-Terry and Generative reward models both
attain an accuracy of 78%, outperforming all off-the-shelf judges. An online
human study further confirms that our trained reward models consistently align
with human preferences in novel LLM-generated stories. We release LitBench and
reward models at

TL;DR: The paper reviews GenAI's role in scientometrics, discussing its potential and limitations in mimicking human reasoning and its impact on tasks like topic labeling and research assessment. It emphasizes the need for systematic comparisons of GenAI models and warns of evolving impacts on scientific language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GenAI's implications for scientometrics, including its ability to mimic human reasoning and its impact on tasks like topic labeling and research assessment.

Method: The paper reviews GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature, relates it to human reasoning debates, and critically examines its use in scientometric tasks.

Result: GenAI excels in language generation tasks (e.g., labeling) but struggles with stable semantics or domain knowledge. Its impact on scientometrics may evolve rapidly.

Conclusion: Systematic comparisons of GenAI models and empirical work are essential to interpret changing knowledge production patterns.

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to review the use of GenAI in scientometrics, and to
begin a debate on the broader implications for the field. First, we provide an
introduction on GenAI's generative and probabilistic nature as rooted in
distributional linguistics. And we relate this to the debate on the extent to
which GenAI might be able to mimic human 'reasoning'. Second, we leverage this
distinction for a critical engagement with recent experiments using GenAI in
scientometrics, including topic labelling, the analysis of citation contexts,
predictive applications, scholars' profiling, and research assessment. GenAI
shows promise in tasks where language generation dominates, such as labelling,
but faces limitations in tasks that require stable semantics, pragmatic
reasoning, or structured domain knowledge. However, these results might become
quickly outdated. Our recommendation is, therefore, to always strive to
systematically compare the performance of different GenAI models for specific
tasks. Third, we inquire whether, by generating large amounts of scientific
language, GenAI might have a fundamental impact on our field by affecting
textual characteristics used to measure science, such as authors, words, and
references. We argue that careful empirical work and theoretical reflection
will be essential to remain capable of interpreting the evolving patterns of
knowledge production.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in groups show a utilitarian boost in moral dilemmas, similar to humans, but the underlying mechanisms differ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs function collectively in moral judgment compared to individual agents, and whether they mimic human group dynamics.

Method: Tested six LLM models on moral dilemmas in Solo (independent reasoning) and Group (multi-turn discussions) conditions.

Result: LLMs in groups found moral violations more acceptable, with some prioritizing overall well-being or showing reduced norm sensitivity. The mechanism differs from humans.

Conclusion: LLM collectives mimic human group behavior superficially, but the drivers differ, impacting AI alignment and multi-agent design.

Abstract: Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social
reasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to
understand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to
individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a
utilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits
for the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar
dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on
well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where
models reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn
discussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must
decide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all
models found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than
individually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that
maximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar
individuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.
However, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their
utilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from
heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced
norm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface
behavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying
drivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent
design, and artificial moral reasoning.

*Alexander Hoyle,Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé,Jordan Boyd-Graber,Philip Resnik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable human evaluation protocol and automated proxy for topic models, validated by crowdworker annotations, shows LLM proxies can replace human annotators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of topic models and document clustering either misalign with human preferences or are unscalable due to expert labels.

Method: Design a human evaluation protocol where annotators (or an LLM proxy) infer categories for groups of documents and apply them. Validate proxies using crowdworker annotations.

Result: LLM-based proxies perform as well as human annotators, making them suitable for automated evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol and LLM proxies offer a scalable and effective alternative to traditional evaluation methods.

Abstract: Topic model and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics
that align poorly with human preferences or require expert labels that are
intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a
corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world
usage of models. Annotators -- or an LLM-based proxy -- review text items
assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that
category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive
crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two
datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding
that the best LLM proxies are statistically indistinguishable from a human
annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated
evaluations. Package, web interface, and data are at

*Karol Przystalski,Jan K. Argasiński,Iwona Grabska-Gradzińska,Jeremi K. Ochab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uses stylometry to differentiate between LLM-generated and human-written texts, achieving high accuracy with tree-based models and stylometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing issues of model attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use by distinguishing LLM-generated texts from human-written ones.

Method: Created a benchmark dataset with human-written and LLM-generated texts, applied stylometric features (lexical, grammatical, syntactic, punctuation), and used tree-based models (decision trees, LightGBM) for classification.

Result: Achieved up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in multiclass classification and .79 to 1 accuracy in binary classification, with Wikipedia vs. GPT-4 reaching .98 accuracy.

Conclusion: Stylometry effectively distinguishes machine-generated from human-written texts for well-defined text types, even with increasingly sophisticated LLMs.

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts
created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model
attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been
used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.
By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing
patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,
with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs
(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text
summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods
(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models
(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and
n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,
grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results
reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the
multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary
classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up
to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed
features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused
words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to
human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the
increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine-
from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

### [152] [TransLaw: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Multi-Agent Simulation of the Collaborative Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00875)
*Xi Xuan,King-kui Sin,Yufei Zhou,Chunyu Kit*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TransLaw, a multi-agent framework using LLMs, excels in translating Hong Kong legal judgments, outperforming GPT-4o in accuracy and coherence but lagging behind human experts in nuanced terminology and style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the challenges of translating Hong Kong legal judgments, such as complex terminology and cultural nuances, using LLMs.

Method: TransLaw employs three specialized agents (Translator, Annotator, Proofreader) for collaborative translation, with customizable LLM configurations.

Result: The framework outperforms GPT-4o in legal semantic accuracy and coherence but falls short of human experts in nuanced aspects. It also reduces costs significantly.

Conclusion: TransLaw demonstrates the potential of LLMs in legal translation but highlights the need for further improvement to match human expertise in nuanced areas.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems empowered by large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of downstream
applications, including machine translation. However, the potential of LLMs in
translating Hong Kong legal judgments remains uncertain due to challenges such
as intricate legal terminology, culturally embedded nuances, and strict
linguistic structures. In this work, we introduce TransLaw, a novel multi-agent
framework implemented for real-world Hong Kong case law translation. It employs
three specialized agents, namely, Translator, Annotator, and Proofreader, to
collaboratively produce translations for high accuracy in legal meaning,
appropriateness in style, and adequate coherence and cohesion in structure.
This framework supports customizable LLM configurations and achieves tremendous
cost reduction compared to professional human translation services. We
evaluated its performance using 13 open-source and commercial LLMs as agents
and obtained interesting findings, including that it surpasses GPT-4o in legal
semantic accuracy, structural coherence, and stylistic fidelity, yet trails
human experts in contextualizing complex terminology and stylistic naturalness.
Our platform website is available at CityUHK, and our bilingual judgment corpus
used for the evaluation is available at Hugging Face.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores cultural biases in math problem presentation, adapting GSM8K for five regions and testing LLMs. Results show performance gaps favoring US-centric data, with reasoning models more resilient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cultural neutrality in math benchmarks, revealing implicit biases in problem presentation.

Method: Created culturally adapted GSM8K variants for five regions, evaluated six LLMs with five prompting strategies.

Result: Models performed best on US-centric data, worse on adapted versions; reasoning models were more resilient.

Conclusion: Cultural context affects math problem-solving; reasoning capabilities mitigate performance gaps.

Abstract: Although mathematics is often considered culturally neutral, the way
mathematical problems are presented can carry implicit cultural context.
Existing benchmarks like GSM8K are predominantly rooted in Western norms,
including names, currencies, and everyday scenarios. In this work, we create
culturally adapted variants of the GSM8K test set for five regions Africa,
India, China, Korea, and Japan using prompt-based transformations followed by
manual verification. We evaluate six large language models (LLMs), ranging from
8B to 72B parameters, across five prompting strategies to assess their
robustness to cultural variation in math problem presentation. Our findings
reveal a consistent performance gap: models perform best on the original
US-centric dataset and comparatively worse on culturally adapted versions.
However, models with reasoning capabilities are more resilient to these shifts,
suggesting that deeper reasoning helps bridge cultural presentation gaps in
mathematical tasks

*Nicholas Lourie,Michael Y. Hu,Kyunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Downstream scaling laws predict task performance from pretraining losses, but linear trends are rare (39% cases) and sensitive to experimental changes. Understanding deviations is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify whether downstream scaling laws can reliably predict task performance and identify conditions for their success.

Method: Meta-analysis of existing data on downstream scaling laws, examining fit to linear trends and sensitivity to experimental changes.

Result: Linear scaling trends occur only 39% of the time, and minor experimental changes can alter scaling behavior.

Conclusion: Scaling laws must account for deviations from linear trends, and conditions for their success need deeper understanding.

Abstract: Downstream scaling laws aim to predict task performance at larger scales from
pretraining losses at smaller scales. Whether this prediction should be
possible is unclear: some works demonstrate that task performance follows clear
linear scaling trends under transformation, whereas others point out
fundamental challenges to downstream scaling laws, such as emergence and
inverse scaling. In this work, we conduct a meta-analysis of existing data on
downstream scaling laws, finding that close fit to linear scaling laws only
occurs in a minority of cases: 39% of the time. Furthermore, seemingly benign
changes to the experimental setting can completely change the scaling trend.
Our analysis underscores the need to understand the conditions under which
scaling laws succeed. To fully model the relationship between pretraining loss
and downstream task performance, we must embrace the cases in which scaling
behavior deviates from linear trends.

TL;DR: MemeCMD is a Chinese multi-turn dialogue dataset with contextually retrieved memes, auto-generated using dual agents and a large-scale meme library, enhancing multimodal conversational AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue datasets lack expressiveness and contextual nuance of multimodal interactions, which memes provide.

Method: Combines a large-scale MLLM-annotated meme library with auto-generated dialogues by dual agents, using a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold for contextual relevance.

Result: Effectively generates contextually appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues.

Conclusion: MemeCMD offers a scalable, privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

Abstract: Memes are widely used in online social interactions, providing vivid,
intuitive, and often humorous means to express intentions and emotions.
Existing dialogue datasets are predominantly limited to either manually
annotated or pure-text conversations, lacking the expressiveness and contextual
nuance that multimodal interactions provide.To address these challenges, we
introduce MemeCMD, an automatically generated Chinese Multi-turn Dialogue
dataset with contextually retrieved memes. Our dataset combines a large-scale,
MLLM-annotated meme library with dialogues auto-generated by dual agents across
diverse scenarios. We introduce a retrieval framework and adaptive threshold to
ensure contextually relevant, naturally spaced meme usage. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating contextually
appropriate and diverse meme-incorporated dialogues, offering a scalable and
privacy-preserving resource for advancing multimodal conversational AI.

*Luise Häuser,Alexandros Stamatakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights the challenge of applying computational phylogenetic methods to cognate data due to insufficient dataset sizes. It tests BabelNet for automatic dataset generation but finds results inconsistent with gold standards, suggesting limited feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for cognate data, which currently lacks large enough datasets for complex models and machine learning.

Method: Automatically extracted cognate datasets from BabelNet and evaluated phylogenetic inferences against gold standard trees.

Result: Phylogenetic trees from BabelNet data were inconsistent with established truths, indicating poor suitability for automatic dataset generation.

Conclusion: Current multilingual resources like BabelNet are unlikely to provide suitable datasets, leaving computational approaches for historical linguistics unresolved.

Abstract: To fully exploit the potential of computational phylogenetic methods for
cognate data one needs to leverage specific (complex) models an machine
learning-based techniques. However, both approaches require datasets that are
substantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently
available. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to
automatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by
automatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual
encyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the
respective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with
the established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we
consider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character
matrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis
approaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate
data. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational
approaches can be applied in historical linguistics.

*Guangliang Liu,Zimo Qi,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the paradoxes in moral self-correction for LLMs, revealing reliance on heuristic shortcuts in discourse constructions. It proposes a solution using curated datasets and discusses generalization challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the superficiality and inconsistency in LLMs' moral self-correction capabilities, despite their potential for alignment with human values.

Method: Analyzing discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora to uncover heuristics, and proposing a solution leveraging curated datasets.

Result: Moral self-correction relies on heuristic shortcuts, leading to inconsistency when enhancing both self-correction and self-diagnosis.

Conclusion: Proposes improving moral self-correction via curated datasets and highlights challenges in generalization across contexts and model scales.

Abstract: Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the
output of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral
self-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite
empirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of
self-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.
Second, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of
their output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency
during their self-correction process. To better understand and address these
paradoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora
designed to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the
heuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral
self-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic
shortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during
self-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both
self-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,
we propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the
heuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges
of this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and
model scales.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether CLM-trained models outperform MLM-trained models in text representation tasks, finding MLM generally better but CLM more data-efficient. A biphasic CLM-MLM training strategy is optimal under fixed computational budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if the advantages of CLM-trained models over MLM-trained models in text representation tasks are due to the CLM objective or confounding factors like model and data scale.

Method: Conducted large-scale pretraining ablations with 30 models (210M to 1B parameters) and over 15,000 fine-tuning runs, comparing MLM and CLM. Proposed a biphasic CLM-MLM training strategy.

Result: MLM generally performs better, but CLM is more data-efficient and stable. The biphasic strategy achieves optimal performance under fixed budgets, especially when initializing from pretrained CLM models.

Conclusion: A biphasic CLM-MLM training strategy is optimal for text representation tasks, leveraging CLM's data efficiency and MLM's performance, reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Learning high-quality text representations is fundamental to a wide range of
NLP tasks. While encoder pretraining has traditionally relied on Masked
Language Modeling (MLM), recent evidence suggests that decoder models
pretrained with Causal Language Modeling (CLM) can be effectively repurposed as
encoders, often surpassing traditional encoders on text representation
benchmarks. However, it remains unclear whether these gains reflect an inherent
advantage of the CLM objective or arise from confounding factors such as model
and data scale. In this paper, we address this question through a series of
large-scale, carefully controlled pretraining ablations, training a total of 30
models ranging from 210 million to 1 billion parameters, and conducting over
15,000 fine-tuning and evaluation runs. We find that while training with MLM
generally yields better performance across text representation tasks,
CLM-trained models are more data-efficient and demonstrate improved fine-tuning
stability. Building on these findings, we experimentally show that a biphasic
training strategy that sequentially applies CLM and then MLM, achieves optimal
performance under a fixed computational training budget. Moreover, we
demonstrate that this strategy becomes more appealing when initializing from
readily available pretrained CLM models (from the existing LLM ecosystem),
reducing the computational burden needed to train best-in-class encoder models.

Conclusion: SciArena successfully engages the community for model evaluation, but automated methods need improvement, as shown by SciArena-Eval.

Abstract: We present SciArena, an open and collaborative platform for evaluating
foundation models on scientific literature tasks. Unlike traditional benchmarks

research community directly, following the Chatbot Arena evaluation approach of
community voting on model comparisons. By leveraging collective intelligence,
SciArena offers a community-driven evaluation of model performance on
open-ended scientific tasks that demand literature-grounded, long-form
responses. The platform currently supports 23 open-source and proprietary
foundation models and has collected over 13,000 votes from trusted researchers
across diverse scientific domains. We analyze the data collected so far and
confirm that the submitted questions are diverse, aligned with real-world
literature needs, and that participating researchers demonstrate strong
self-consistency and inter-annotator agreement in their evaluations. We discuss
the results and insights based on the model ranking leaderboard. To further
promote research in building model-based automated evaluation systems for
literature tasks, we release SciArena-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark based

TL;DR: HDRAM introduces a symbolic memory framework for LLMs, addressing precision loss as information spreading and improving associative retrieval using CHQ principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from precision loss, reframed as information spreading, which is addressed by treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum channel.

Method: HDRAM uses hypertokens, integrating ECC, holographic computing, and quantum-inspired search, enabling efficient key-value operations and Grover-style search.

Result: HDRAM significantly improves associative retrieval in LLMs without architectural changes.

Conclusion: CHQ principles can enhance transformer architectures by addressing memory and retrieval challenges.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but suffer from
apparent precision loss, reframed here as information spreading. This reframing
shifts the problem from computational precision to an information-theoretic
communication issue. We address the K:V and V:K memory problem in LLMs by
introducing HDRAM (Holographically Defined Random Access Memory), a symbolic
memory framework treating transformer latent space as a spread-spectrum
channel. Built upon hypertokens, structured symbolic codes integrating
classical error-correcting codes (ECC), holographic computing, and
quantum-inspired search, HDRAM recovers distributed information through
principled despreading. These phase-coherent memory addresses enable efficient
key-value operations and Grover-style search in latent space. By combining ECC
grammar with compressed sensing and Krylov subspace alignment, HDRAM
significantly improves associative retrieval without architectural changes,
demonstrating how Classical-Holographic-Quantum-inspired (CHQ) principles can
fortify transformer architectures.

TL;DR: NeutroSENSE is a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework for interpretable IoT intrusion detection, combining Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic to quantify uncertainty and enable abstention. It achieves 97% accuracy and flags uncertain predictions for review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve intrusion detection in IoT by addressing uncertainty and enabling interpretability through neutrosophic logic.

Method: Integrates Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, decomposing predictions into truth, falsity, and indeterminacy components. Uses adaptive thresholds to flag uncertain predictions.

Result: Achieved 97% accuracy on IoT-CAD dataset, with misclassified samples showing higher indeterminacy (I=0.62 vs. I=0.24 for correct ones). Indeterminacy correlates with error likelihood.

Conclusion: NeutroSENSE enhances accuracy and explainability in IoT intrusion detection, supporting trust-aware AI decisions in edge deployments.

Abstract: This paper presents NeutroSENSE, a neutrosophic-enhanced ensemble framework
for interpretable intrusion detection in IoT environments. By integrating
Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression with neutrosophic logic, the
system decomposes prediction confidence into truth (T), falsity (F), and
indeterminacy (I) components, enabling uncertainty quantification and
abstention. Predictions with high indeterminacy are flagged for review using
both global and adaptive, class-specific thresholds. Evaluated on the IoT-CAD
dataset, NeutroSENSE achieved 97% accuracy, while demonstrating that
misclassified samples exhibit significantly higher indeterminacy (I = 0.62)
than correct ones (I = 0.24). The use of indeterminacy as a proxy for
uncertainty enables informed abstention and targeted review-particularly
valuable in edge deployments. Figures and tables validate the correlation
between I-scores and error likelihood, supporting more trustworthy,
human-in-the-loop AI decisions. This work shows that neutrosophic logic
enhances both accuracy and explainability, providing a practical foundation for
trust-aware AI in edge and fog-based IoT security systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DS3, a framework for optimizing inference costs in LLMs by modeling it as stochastic traversal over a skill graph, enabling comparative analysis of strategies like CoT and ToT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational, energy, and financial costs of LLMs, especially during inference, necessitate more efficient operating points beyond existing scaling laws.

Method: Proposes DS3, a framework representing inference as stochastic traversal over a learned skill graph, with closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost.

Result: Theoretically recovers empirical patterns like linear accuracy scaling with logarithmic compute and variation in inference strategies based on task difficulty and model capability.

Conclusion: DS3 enhances theoretical understanding of training-inference interdependencies, supporting better algorithmic design and resource allocation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand considerable computational, energy, and
financial resources during both training and deployment. While scaling laws for
training have guided much of the field's recent progress, inference costs now
represent a significant and growing component of the overall resource burden,
particularly for reasoning-focused models. Existing characterizations of
compute-optimality that consider model size, dataset size, and inference tokens
in isolation or in fixed combinations risk overlooking more efficient operating
points. We introduce directed stochastic skill search (DS3), a general
framework that represents inference as stochastic traversal over a learned
skill graph. From a simplified yet expressive instantiation, we derive
closed-form expressions for task success and compute cost across a wide range
of inference strategies -- including chain-of-thought (CoT) and tree-of-thought
(ToT) -- enabling comparative analysis as a function of task difficulty and
model capability. To that end, we extend a prior first-principles tripartite
graph framework of LLM training to incorporate inference, and separately bridge
DS3 with empirical methods that characterize LLM scaling behavior. We
theoretically recover empirically observed patterns, including: linear accuracy
scaling with logarithmic compute; variation in preferred inference strategies
as a function of task difficulty and model capability; emergent behavior
elicited by reasoning even when performance plateaus under parameter scaling;
and both best-of-N (BoN) and majority voting behavior captured within a unified
analytical framework. By explicitly characterizing training-inference
interdependencies, our framework deepens theoretical understanding and supports
principled algorithmic design and resource allocation.

TL;DR: The paper presents a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Elevator Group Control System (EGCS) that outperforms traditional rule-based algorithms by efficiently managing elevator traffic in stochastic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient elevator traffic management is crucial for minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption, but heuristic or pattern-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and combinatorial nature of dispatching.

Method: The system is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and trained using RL, featuring innovations like a novel action space encoding, infra-steps for continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward signal. Dueling Double Deep Q-learning is explored.

Result: The RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns and outperforms traditional rule-based algorithms in a highly stochastic environment.

Conclusion: The proposed RL approach effectively addresses the challenges of elevator dispatching, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for large buildings.

Abstract: Efficient elevator traffic management in large buildings is critical for
minimizing passenger travel times and energy consumption. Because heuristic- or
pattern-detection-based controllers struggle with the stochastic and
combinatorial nature of dispatching, we model the six-elevator, fifteen-floor
system at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a Markov Decision Process and train
an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) Elevator Group Control System (EGCS).
Key innovations include a novel action space encoding to handle the
combinatorial complexity of elevator dispatching, the introduction of
infra-steps to model continuous passenger arrivals, and a tailored reward
signal to improve learning efficiency. In addition, we explore various ways to
adapt the discounting factor to the infra-step formulation. We investigate RL
architectures based on Dueling Double Deep Q-learning, showing that the
proposed RL-based EGCS adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns, learns from a
highly stochastic environment, and thereby outperforms a traditional rule-based
algorithm.

Motivation: To protect DNN intellectual property by making models undistillable, preventing effective knowledge distillation.

Method: Proposes CMIM, training DNNs to minimize CMI of output clusters across temperatures, alongside cross-entropy loss.

Result: CMIM models are undistillable by tested KD methods and outperform models trained with only cross-entropy loss.

Conclusion: CMIM effectively creates undistillable DNNs, enhancing intellectual property protection without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) is said to be undistillable if, when used as a
black-box input-output teacher, it cannot be distilled through knowledge
distillation (KD). In this case, the distilled student (referred to as the
knockoff student) does not outperform a student trained independently with
label smoothing (LS student) in terms of prediction accuracy. To protect
intellectual property of DNNs, it is desirable to build undistillable DNNs. To
this end, it is first observed that an undistillable DNN may have the trait
that each cluster of its output probability distributions in response to all
sample instances with the same label should be highly concentrated to the
extent that each cluster corresponding to each label should ideally collapse
into one probability distribution. Based on this observation and by measuring
the concentration of each cluster in terms of conditional mutual information
(CMI), a new training method called CMI minimized (CMIM) method is proposed,
which trains a DNN by jointly minimizing the conventional cross entropy (CE)
loss and the CMI values of all temperature scaled clusters across the entire
temperature spectrum. The resulting CMIM model is shown, by extensive
experiments, to be undistillable by all tested KD methods existing in the
literature. That is, the knockoff students distilled by these KD methods from
the CMIM model underperform the respective LS students. In addition, the CMIM
model is also shown to performs better than the model trained with the CE loss
alone in terms of their own prediction accuracy.

*Hyunwoo Seo,Chiehyeon Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-MTM improves time-series forecasting by combining masked modeling with seasonal-trend decomposition and contrastive learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing masked time-series modeling ignores inherent semantic structures, leading to spurious patterns. Addressing entangled temporal patterns through decomposition can improve forecasting.

Method: ST-MTM uses seasonal-trend decomposition with novel masking strategies: period masking for seasonal components and sub-series masking for trend components. It also incorporates contrastive learning.

Result: ST-MTM achieves superior forecasting performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Decomposition-aware masking and contrastive learning enhance temporal pattern capture, making ST-MTM effective for complex time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Forecasting complex time series is an important yet challenging problem that
involves various industrial applications. Recently, masked time-series modeling
has been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by
reconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic
information in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations
generated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series
ignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious
temporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal
semantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled
patterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a
masked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which
includes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that
incorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a
period masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked
seasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking
strategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar
variations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task
for learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies. Additionally,
ST-MTM introduces a contrastive learning task to support masked modeling by
enhancing contextual consistency among multiple masked seasonal
representations. Experimental results show that our proposed ST-MTM achieves
consistently superior forecasting performance compared to existing masked
modeling, contrastive learning, and supervised forecasting methods.

preliminary analysis of inter-task structural similarity and contextual
sensitivity, (ii) an interactive LangGraph-based evaluation framework augmented
with a FAISS-backed semantic memory module, and (iii) a suite of specialized
continual learning metrics -- including average accuracy, forgetting,
forward/backward transfer, tool-use efficiency, and a generalized Composite
Continual Learning Score and CL-F-beta score -- to capture the
stability-plasticity trade-off. We outline a rigorous experimental protocol
comparing memory-enabled and memory-disabled agents across diverse Python

*Lu Zhang,Sangarapillai Lambotharan,Gan Zheng,Guisheng Liao,Xuekang Liu,Fabio Roli,Carsten Maple*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel ViT architecture with an adversarial indicator (AdvI) token is proposed to defend against adversarial attacks in modulation classification, combining training and runtime defenses in one model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks in modulation classification for IoT devices, necessitating a robust defense mechanism.

Method: Introduces an AdvI token in ViT to detect attacks, integrates adversarial training, and examines attention mechanisms to highlight suspicious features.

Result: Outperforms competitive methods in white-box attack scenarios, including FGM, PGD, and BIM.

Conclusion: The AdvI token effectively enhances ViT's defense against adversarial attacks, simplifying system architecture while improving robustness.

Abstract: The remarkable success of transformers across various fields such as natural
language processing and computer vision has paved the way for their
applications in automatic modulation classification, a critical component in
the communication systems of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, it has
been observed that transformer-based classification of radio signals is
susceptible to subtle yet sophisticated adversarial attacks. To address this
issue, we have developed a defensive strategy for transformer-based modulation
classification systems to counter such adversarial attacks. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision transformer (ViT) architecture by introducing a new
concept known as adversarial indicator (AdvI) token to detect adversarial
attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose an
AdvI token in ViT to defend against adversarial attacks. Integrating an
adversarial training method with a detection mechanism using AdvI token, we
combine a training time defense and running time defense in a unified neural
network model, which reduces architectural complexity of the system compared to
detecting adversarial perturbations using separate models. We investigate into
the operational principles of our method by examining the attention mechanism.
We show the proposed AdvI token acts as a crucial element within the ViT,
influencing attention weights and thereby highlighting regions or features in
the input data that are potentially suspicious or anomalous. Through
experimental results, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses several
competitive methods in handling white-box attack scenarios, including those
utilizing the fast gradient method, projected gradient descent attacks and
basic iterative method.

*Xuanbo Liu,Liu Liu,Fuxiang Wu,Fusheng Hao,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRFT is an efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method that updates specific rows or columns of weight matrices, reducing storage and computational demands while achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models is resource-intensive. Existing methods like GPS reduce parameters but increase resource needs. GRFT aims to address these inefficiencies.

Method: GRFT updates rows or columns of weight matrices with the highest sum of squared gradients, incorporating regularization for better knowledge transfer.

Result: GRFT outperforms GPS, Adapter Tuning, and LoRA, updating only 1.22% (FGVC) and 0.30% (VTAB) of parameters.

Conclusion: GRFT is highly efficient and effective, reducing resource demands while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated extensive applications across
various fields. However, fine-tuning these models for specific downstream tasks
demands significant computational resources and storage. One fine-tuning
method, gradient-based parameter selection (GPS), focuses on fine-tuning only
the parameters with high gradients in each neuron, thereby reducing the number
of training parameters. Nevertheless, this approach increases computational
resource requirements and storage demands. In this paper, we propose an
efficient gradient-based and regularized fine-tuning method (GRFT) that updates
the rows or columns of the weight matrix. We theoretically demonstrate that the
rows or columns with the highest sum of squared gradients are optimal for
updating. This strategy effectively reduces storage overhead and improves the
efficiency of parameter selection. Additionally, we incorporate regularization
to enhance knowledge transfer from the pre-trained model. GRFT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods such as GPS, Adapter
Tuning, and LoRA. Notably, GRFT requires updating only 1.22% and 0.30% of the
total parameters on FGVC and VTAB datasets, respectively, demonstrating its
high efficiency and effectiveness. The source code will be released soon.

TL;DR: The paper presents a unified framework linking SFT and preference learning in LLM post-training, showing SFT as a special case of implicit reward learning. It identifies a limitation in SFT and proposes solutions, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between SFT and preference learning in LLM post-training and address limitations in conventional SFT methods.

Method: Theoretical analysis and mathematical derivations linking SFT and preference learning, proposing learning rate reduction and alternative SFT objectives.

Result: Up to 25% relative gain and 6% absolute win rate improvement in instruction following tasks.

Conclusion: The unified framework and proposed methods enhance LLM post-training, with experimental validation supporting the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Post-training processes are essential phases in grounding pre-trained
language models to real-world tasks, with learning from demonstrations or
preference signals playing a crucial role in this adaptation. We present a
unified theoretical framework bridging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
preference learning in Large Language Model (LLM) post-training. Through
rigorous mathematical derivation, we demonstrate that both SFT and preference
learning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) operate within the
same optimal policy-reward subspace, with SFT representing a special case of
implicit reward learning. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation in
conventional SFT: the KL divergence term in distribution matching becomes
constant with respect to the policy during optimization, failing to constrain
model updates. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective learning rate
reduction approach that yields significant performance improvements (up to
\textbf{25\%} relative gain and \textbf{6\%} absolute win rate increase in
instruction following tasks. Additionally, we derive alternative SFT objectives
from various f-divergence functions that preserve the KL term during
optimization, further enhancing post-DPO model performance. Finally, we extend
the theoretical relationship between LLM logits and Q-functions from preference
learning to the SFT context, providing mathematical derivations and
experimental validation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes and compares three quantum-inspired data encoding strategies (ILS, GDS, CCVS) for classical ML models, focusing on reducing encoding time while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize quantum-inspired data transformations for classical ML by reducing encoding time and ensuring correct encoding values.

Method: Three encoding strategies are evaluated: ILS (treats each row independently), GDS (uniformly maps unique feature values), and CCVS (encodes unique values per class).

Result: The study assesses encoding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational cost, highlighting trade-offs between encoding time, precision, and performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into optimizing quantum-inspired data transformations for classical ML workflows.

Abstract: In this study, we propose, evaluate and compare three quantum inspired data
encoding strategies, Instance Level Strategy (ILS), Global Discrete Strategy
(GDS) and Class Conditional Value Strategy (CCVS), for transforming classical
data into quantum data for use in pure classical machine learning models. The
primary objective is to reduce high encoding time while ensuring correct
encoding values and analyzing their impact on classification performance. The
Instance Level Strategy treats each row of dataset independently; mimics local
quantum states. Global Discrete Value Based encoding strategy maps all unique
feature values across the full dataset to quantum states uniformly. In
contrast, the Class conditional Value based encoding strategy encodes unique
values separately for each class, preserving class dependent information.
  We apply these encoding strategies to a classification task and assess their
impact on en-coding efficiency, correctness, model accuracy, and computational
cost. By analyzing the trade offs between encoding time, precision, and
predictive performance, this study provides insights into optimizing quantum
inspired data transformations for classical machine learning workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used to improve Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating flexible prior proposals, outperforming traditional Karhunen-Loève Expansion (KLE) in cases of unknown correlation structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like KLE require prior knowledge of covariance functions, which is often unavailable. The study aims to provide a data-driven alternative for Bayesian inverse problems.

Method: The VAE framework is applied to capture diverse correlation structures in subsurface flow modeling. It is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow inversion problem using pressure data to estimate permeability fields.

Result: VAE matches KLE's accuracy when correlation length is known and outperforms KLE when assumptions are incorrect. It also reduces stochastic dimensionality, enhancing computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Deep generative models like VAE can make McMC methods more adaptable and efficient for high-dimensional Bayesian inference.

Abstract: This study uses a Variational Autoencoder method to enhance the efficiency
and applicability of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods by generating
broader-spectrum prior proposals. Traditional approaches, such as the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve Expansion (KLE), require previous knowledge of the covariance
function, often unavailable in practical applications. The VAE framework
enables a data-driven approach to flexibly capture a broader range of
correlation structures in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly subsurface
flow modeling. The methodology is tested on a synthetic groundwater flow
inversion problem, where pressure data is used to estimate permeability fields.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the VAE-based parameterization achieves
comparable accuracy to KLE when the correlation length is known and outperforms
KLE when the assumed correlation length deviates from the true value. Moreover,
the VAE approach significantly reduces stochastic dimensionality, improving
computational efficiency. The results suggest that leveraging deep generative
models in McMC methods can lead to more adaptable and efficient Bayesian
inference in high-dimensional problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning framework, addresses challenges in high-dimensional materials design by augmenting data, refining predictions with LLMs, and incorporating expert knowledge, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing machine learning methods struggle with reliability in high-dimensional spaces and fail to integrate domain expertise, hindering knowledge-guided inverse design.

Method: AIMatDesign uses reinforcement learning, difference-based algorithms for data augmentation, LLM-guided refinement, and knowledge-based rewards.

Result: AIMatDesign outperforms traditional methods in efficiency, convergence, and success rates, validated by synthesizing high-performance Zr-based alloys.

Conclusion: The framework reliably predicts material properties and trends, proving effective for closed-loop materials discovery.

Abstract: With the growing demand for novel materials, machine learning-driven inverse
design methods face significant challenges in reconciling the high-dimensional
materials composition space with limited experimental data. Existing approaches
suffer from two major limitations: (I) machine learning models often lack
reliability in high-dimensional spaces, leading to prediction biases during the
design process; (II) these models fail to effectively incorporate domain expert
knowledge, limiting their capacity to support knowledge-guided inverse design.
To address these challenges, we introduce AIMatDesign, a reinforcement learning
framework that addresses these limitations by augmenting experimental data
using difference-based algorithms to build a trusted experience pool,
accelerating model convergence. To enhance model reliability, an automated
refinement strategy guided by large language models (LLMs) dynamically corrects
prediction inconsistencies, reinforcing alignment between reward signals and
state value functions. Additionally, a knowledge-based reward function
leverages expert domain rules to improve stability and efficiency during
training. Our experiments demonstrate that AIMatDesign significantly surpasses
traditional machine learning and reinforcement learning methods in discovery
efficiency, convergence speed, and success rates. Among the numerous candidates
proposed by AIMatDesign, experimental synthesis of representative Zr-based
alloys yielded a top-performing BMG with 1.7GPa yield strength and 10.2\%
elongation, closely matching predictions. Moreover, the framework accurately
captured the trend of yield strength variation with composition, demonstrating
its reliability and potential for closed-loop materials discovery.

TL;DR: FNSDA introduces a parameter-efficient method for generalizing neural network predictions to unseen dynamical systems by adapting in Fourier space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural networks struggle to generalize across systems with shared dynamics but differing environmental characteristics.

Method: FNSDA partitions dynamics in Fourier modes, adjusts modes for new environments using low-dimensional latent parameters.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in generalization with reduced parameter cost on four dynamic systems.

Conclusion: FNSDA offers efficient and effective generalization for dynamical systems modeling.

Abstract: Learning the underlying dynamics from data with deep neural networks has
shown remarkable potential in modeling various complex physical dynamics.
However, current approaches are constrained in their ability to make reliable
predictions in a specific domain and struggle with generalizing to unseen
systems that are governed by the same general dynamics but differ in
environmental characteristics. In this work, we formulate a parameter-efficient
method, Fourier Neural Simulator for Dynamical Adaptation (FNSDA), that can
readily generalize to new dynamics via adaptation in the Fourier space.
Specifically, FNSDA identifies the shareable dynamics based on the known
environments using an automatic partition in Fourier modes and learns to adjust
the modes specific for each new environment by conditioning on low-dimensional
latent systematic parameters for efficient generalization. We evaluate our
approach on four representative families of dynamic systems, and the results
show that FNSDA can achieve superior or competitive generalization performance
compared to existing methods with a significantly reduced parameter cost. Our

TL;DR: ROSE, a framework using multi-objective reinforcement learning, improves adversarial prompt generation for LLM safety evaluation by enhancing topic diversity and contextual richness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing manual safety benchmarks for LLMs are static and labor-intensive, while automated methods lack topic diversity and real-world alignment.

Method: Proposes ROSE, a framework using multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for generating diverse and context-rich prompts.

Result: ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety vulnerabilities in LLMs, with improved evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: ROSE advances practical, reality-oriented safety evaluation for LLMs.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as black-box
components in real-world applications, evaluating their safety-especially under
adversarial prompting-has become critical. Arguably, effective safety
evaluations should be adaptive, evolving with LLM capabilities, and also cover
a broad spectrum of harmful topics and real-world scenarios to fully expose
potential vulnerabilities. Existing manual safety benchmarks, built on
handcrafted adversarial prompts, are limited by their static nature and the
intensive labor required to update them, making it difficult to keep pace with
rapidly advancing LLMs. In contrast, automated adversarial prompt generation
offers a promising path toward adaptive evaluation. However, current methods
often suffer from insufficient adversarial topic coverage (topic-level
diversity) and weak alignment with real-world contexts. These shortcomings stem
from the exploration-exploitation dilemma in black-box optimization and a lack
of real-world contextualization, resulting in adversarial prompts that are both
topically narrow and scenario-repetitive. To address these issues, we propose
Reality-Oriented Safety Evaluation (ROSE), a novel framework that uses
multi-objective reinforcement learning to fine-tune an adversarial LLM for
generating topically diverse and contextually rich adversarial prompts.
Experiments show that ROSE outperforms existing methods in uncovering safety
vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art LLMs, with notable improvements in
integrated evaluation metrics. We hope ROSE represents a step toward more
practical and reality-oriented safety evaluation of LLMs. WARNING: This paper

TL;DR: HiT-JEPA is a hierarchical framework for multi-scale urban trajectory representation, combining fine-grained details and high-level semantics for better analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to integrate fine-grained details and high-level summaries in trajectory data, limiting their ability to capture both local and global patterns.

Method: HiT-JEPA uses a three-layer hierarchy to progressively capture point-level details, intermediate patterns, and high-level abstractions, unifying local and global semantics.

Result: Experiments show HiT-JEPA produces richer, multi-scale representations, improving trajectory similarity computation.

Conclusion: HiT-JEPA effectively addresses the challenge of multi-scale trajectory representation, offering a unified solution for diverse spatial movement analysis.

Abstract: The representation of urban trajectory data plays a critical role in
effectively analyzing spatial movement patterns. Despite considerable progress,
the challenge of designing trajectory representations that can capture diverse
and complementary information remains an open research problem. Existing
methods struggle in incorporating trajectory fine-grained details and
high-level summary in a single model, limiting their ability to attend to both
long-term dependencies while preserving local nuances. To address this, we
propose HiT-JEPA (Hierarchical Interactions of Trajectory Semantics via a Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture), a unified framework for learning
multi-scale urban trajectory representations across semantic abstraction
levels. HiT-JEPA adopts a three-layer hierarchy that progressively captures
point-level fine-grained details, intermediate patterns, and high-level
trajectory abstractions, enabling the model to integrate both local dynamics
and global semantics in one coherent structure. Extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets for trajectory similarity computation show that
HiT-JEPA's hierarchical design yields richer, multi-scale representations. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRA-Mixer integrates LoRA with MoE for efficient multi-task adaptation in LLMs, improving performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing LoRA-MoE methods by enhancing parameter efficiency and task fidelity.

Method: Replace projection matrices with task-specific LoRA experts, using hard-soft routing or pre-trained modules, and introduce Specialization Balance Loss for robust training.

Result: Significant improvements on benchmarks (e.g., GSM8K: +7.61%, HumanEval: +4.88%) with 48% fewer parameters than SOTA.

Conclusion: LoRA-Mixer is efficient, modular, and outperforms existing methods in multi-task adaptation.

Abstract: Recent efforts to combine low-rank adaptation (LoRA) with mixture-of-experts
(MoE) for adapting large language models (LLMs) to multiple tasks still exhibit
prevailing limitations: they either swap entire attention/feed-forward layers
for switch experts or bolt on parallel expert branches, diluting parameter
efficiency and task fidelity. We propose the LoRA-Mixer, a modular and
lightweight MoE framework that integrates LoRA experts. Our core innovation
lies in replacing the projection matrices of the attention module's
input/output linear layers with dynamically routed, task-specific LoRA experts.
This design ensures seamless compatibility with diverse foundation models,
including transformers and state space models (SSMs), by leveraging their
inherent linear projection structures. The framework supports two operational
paradigms: (1) joint optimization of LoRA experts and routing mechanisms via a
novel hard-soft routing strategy, or (2) direct deployment of pre-trained,
frozen LoRA modules sourced from external repositories. To enable robust router
training with limited data while ensuring stable routing decisions and
maximizing expert reuse, we introduce an adaptive Specialization Balance Loss
(SBL) that jointly optimizes expert balance and task-specific alignment.
Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, including MedQA, CoLA,
SST-2, GSM8K, ARC-E, ARC-C, and HumanEval, demonstrate the effectiveness of
LoRA-Mixer. On datasets such as GSM8K, HumanEval, and MedQA, LoRA-Mixer
achieves significant improvements of 7.61%, 4.88%, and 3.08% over the base
models, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, LoRA-Mixer
achieves additional improvements of 1.09%, 1.45%, and 1.68%, respectively,
using only 48% of the parameters, demonstrating its efficiency and strong
performance.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable solution for real-time applications requiring dynamic action durations.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex
sequential decision-making tasks, such as playing Atari 2600 games and
mastering board games. A critical yet underexplored aspect of DRL is the
temporal scale of action execution. We propose a novel paradigm that integrates
contextual bandits with DRL to adaptively select action durations, enhancing
policy flexibility and computational efficiency. Our approach augments a Deep
Q-Network (DQN) with a contextual bandit module that learns to choose optimal

This paradigm offers a scalable solution for real-time applications like gaming

Motivation: Accurate human mobility modeling is crucial for epidemic spread understanding and intervention deployment.

Method: Proposed SPN technique aggregates signals from neighboring H3 grid cells to enhance sparse mobility data forecasting. Evaluated on NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net models.

Result: SPN consistently improves forecasting, reducing test MSE by up to 9.85%.

Conclusion: Spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals is a simple yet effective method for robust spatio-temporal forecasting during health crises.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of human mobility is critical for understanding epidemic

large-scale spatio-temporal dataset collected from Peru's national Digital
Contact Tracing (DCT) application during the COVID-19 pandemic to forecast
mobility flows across urban regions. A key challenge lies in the spatial
sparsity of hourly mobility counts across hexagonal grid cells, which limits
the predictive power of conventional time series models. To address this, we
propose a lightweight and model-agnostic Spatial Neighbourhood Fusion (SPN)
technique that augments each cell's features with aggregated signals from its
immediate H3 neighbors. We evaluate this strategy on three forecasting
backbones: NLinear, PatchTST, and K-U-Net, under various historical input
lengths. Experimental results show that SPN consistently improves forecasting
performance, achieving up to 9.85 percent reduction in test MSE. Our findings
demonstrate that spatial smoothing of sparse mobility signals provides a simple
yet effective path toward robust spatio-temporal forecasting during public
health crises.

### [181] [Data Collection with Non-Uniform Axial Power for Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML Critical Heat Flux Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00034)
*Reece Bourisaw,Reid McCants,Jean-Marie Le Corre,Anna Iskhakova,Arsen S. Iskhakov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compiles a CHF dataset for AI/ML benchmarking, highlighting the limitations of classical correlations and neural networks under non-uniform heating, and advocates for models incorporating axial power distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark by providing a comprehensive dataset for uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions, addressing the limitations of existing methods.

Method: Heating profiles were extracted from reports, interpolated, validated, and encoded for machine readability. Classical correlations and neural networks were evaluated.

Result: Classical correlations and neural networks trained on uniform data perform poorly under non-uniform heating, emphasizing the need for models that account for axial power distributions.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational data and insights for future work on transfer learning, uncertainty quantification, and design optimization in CHF prediction.

Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water
reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II
of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power
profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both
uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were
extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh,
validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats
for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating
and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular
methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network
trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to
generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models
that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these
curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork
for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification,
and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.

*Rohan Putatunda,Sanjay Purushotham,Ratnaksha Lele,Vandana P. Janeja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid IDRIFTNET model combines physics-driven analytics and deep learning to improve iceberg trajectory forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate iceberg trajectory forecasting is challenging due to sparse data and complex environmental influences, limiting deep learning models' effectiveness.

Method: Proposes IDRIFTNET, integrating analytical iceberg drift physics with residual learning and spectral neural networks to capture global and local patterns.

Result: IDRIFTNET achieves lower Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) compared to other models on Antarctic icebergs A23A and B22A.

Conclusion: IDRIFTNET effectively forecasts iceberg trajectories under dynamic conditions, demonstrating superior performance in capturing nonlinear drift patterns.

Abstract: Drifting icebergs in the polar oceans play a key role in the Earth's climate
system, impacting freshwater fluxes into the ocean and regional ecosystems
while also posing a challenge to polar navigation. However, accurately
forecasting iceberg trajectories remains a formidable challenge, primarily due
to the scarcity of spatiotemporal data and the complex, nonlinear nature of
iceberg motion, which is also impacted by environmental variables. The iceberg
motion is influenced by multiple dynamic environmental factors, creating a
highly variable system that makes trajectory identification complex. These
limitations hinder the ability of deep learning models to effectively capture
the underlying dynamics and provide reliable predictive outcomes. To address
these challenges, we propose a hybrid IDRIFTNET model, a physics-driven deep
learning model that combines an analytical formulation of iceberg drift
physics, with an augmented residual learning model. The model learns the
pattern of mismatch between the analytical solution and ground-truth
observations, which is combined with a rotate-augmented spectral neural network
that captures both global and local patterns from the data to forecast future
iceberg drift positions. We compare IDRIFTNET model performance with
state-of-the-art models on two Antarctic icebergs: A23A and B22A. Our findings
demonstrate that IDRIFTNET outperforms other models by achieving a lower Final
Displacement Error (FDE) and Average Displacement Error (ADE) across a variety
of time points. These results highlight IDRIFTNET's effectiveness in capturing
the complex, nonlinear drift of icebergs for forecasting iceberg trajectories
under limited data and dynamic environmental conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neuron-centric model fusion algorithm integrates multiple neural networks into one, outperforming prior methods, especially in zero-shot and non-IID scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model fusion is challenging due to differences in internal representations (e.g., permutation invariance, random initialization, or varied training data distributions).

Method: Neuron-centric algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent models, using neuron attribution scores to create target representations for the fused model.

Result: The algorithms consistently outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates multiple trained neural networks, generalizing to arbitrary layer types and improving fusion outcomes.

Abstract: Model fusion aims to combine the knowledge of multiple models by creating one
representative model that captures the strengths of all of its parents.
However, this process is non-trivial due to differences in internal
representations, which can stem from permutation invariance, random
initialization, or differently distributed training data. We present a novel,
neuron-centric family of model fusion algorithms designed to integrate multiple
trained neural networks into a single network effectively regardless of
training data distribution. Our algorithms group intermediate neurons of parent
models to create target representations that the fused model approximates with
its corresponding sub-network. Unlike prior approaches, our approach
incorporates neuron attribution scores into the fusion process. Furthermore,
our algorithms can generalize to arbitrary layer types. Experimental results on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our algorithms consistently
outperform previous fusion techniques, particularly in zero-shot and non-IID
fusion scenarios. The code is available at

*Fei Chen,Wenchi Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data reduction strategy using Pointwise V-information (PVI) to enhance model training efficiency by selecting optimal instances, preserving performance while reducing data volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve data quality and training efficiency by identifying and using the most informative instances in large datasets.

Method: Quantifies instance difficulty with PVI, filters low-difficulty instances statically, and uses progressive learning on sorted instances.

Result: Removing 10%-30% of data preserves classifier performance (0.0001%-0.76% accuracy loss); progressive learning achieves 0.8% accuracy gain.

Conclusion: Effective data reduction with PVI enhances model performance and training efficiency, with successful cross-lingual application to Chinese NLP tasks.

Abstract: Data reduction plays a vital role in data-centric AI by identifying the most
informative instance within large-scale datasets to enhance model training
efficiency. The core challenge lies in how to select the optimal
instances-rather than the entire datasets-to improve data quality and training
efficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective data reduction strategy
based on Pointwise V-information(PVI). First, we quantify instance difficulty
using PVI and filter out low-difficulty instances enabling a static approach.
Experiments demonstrate that removing 10%-30% of the data preserves the
classifier performance with only a 0.0001% to 0.76% loss in accuracy.Second, we
use a progressive learning approach to training the classifiers on instances
sorted by ascending PVI, accelerating convergence and achieving a 0.8% accuracy
gain over conventional training. Our results suggest that with the effective
data reduction strategy, training a classifier on the selected optimal subset
could enhance the model performance and boost training efficiency. Moreover, we
have transferred the PVI framework, which previously applied only to English
datasets, to diverse Chinese NLP tasks and base models, leading to valuable
insights for cross-lingual data reduction and faster training. The codes are
released at https://github.com/zhouwenchi/DatasetReductionStrategy.

*Lucas Potin,Rosa Figueiredo,Vincent Labatut,Christine Largeron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper compares 38 quality measures for graph classification, evaluates their theoretical properties, and proposes a clustering-based preprocessing step to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a systematic comparison of quality measures for graph classification leads to the arbitrary use of popular measures without thorough evaluation.

Method: The study characterizes 38 quality measures theoretically, benchmarks them using public datasets, and introduces a clustering-based preprocessing step to group patterns.

Result: Some widely used measures underperform, while the proposed preprocessing step reduces pattern count without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into selecting quality measures for graph classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of clustering-based preprocessing.

Abstract: Graph classification aims to categorize graphs based on their structural and
attribute features, with applications in diverse fields such as social network
analysis and bioinformatics. Among the methods proposed to solve this task,
those relying on patterns (i.e. subgraphs) provide good explainability, as the
patterns used for classification can be directly interpreted. To identify
meaningful patterns, a standard approach is to use a quality measure, i.e. a
function that evaluates the discriminative power of each pattern. However, the
literature provides tens of such measures, making it difficult to select the
most appropriate for a given application. Only a handful of surveys try to
provide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically
focuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most
widespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we
present a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We
characterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We
leverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a
method to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these
resources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of
pattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a
clustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the
same graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to
be processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that
some popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the
best results.

*Varsha Pendyala,Pedro Morgado,William Sethares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LiSER is a knowledge distillation framework for speech emotion recognition (SER) that reduces reliance on labeled data by leveraging unlabeled audio-visual data and teacher models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice interfaces can enhance human-computer interaction by recognizing user emotions, but collecting labeled data for SER is costly.

Method: LiSER uses large teacher models (speech and face representation) to distill knowledge into lightweight student models, utilizing unlabeled audio-visual data.

Result: Experiments on RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets show LiSER reduces the need for extensive labeled data in SER tasks.

Conclusion: LiSER offers a cost-effective solution for SER by minimizing labeled data dependency through knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can
benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on
user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual
cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However,
collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive.
This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER
(LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher
models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers
knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher
models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark
datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence
on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Smooth-Distill is a self-distillation framework for HAR and sensor placement detection, using a unified CNN (MTL-net) with a smoothed historical model as the teacher. It outperforms alternatives, reduces computational overhead, and avoids overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational inefficiency of traditional distillation methods and improve multitask learning for HAR and sensor placement detection.

Method: Uses MTL-net, a CNN processing accelerometer data, with a smoothed historical model as the teacher for self-distillation. Evaluated on a new dataset and two public ones.

Result: Outperforms alternatives in HAR and sensor placement tasks, showing better convergence and reduced overfitting.

Conclusion: Smooth-Distill offers an efficient, accurate solution for multitask learning with accelerometer data, reducing computational costs for resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: This paper introduces Smooth-Distill, a novel self-distillation framework
designed to simultaneously perform human activity recognition (HAR) and sensor
placement detection using wearable sensor data. The proposed approach utilizes
a unified CNN-based architecture, MTL-net, which processes accelerometer data
and branches into two outputs for each respective task. Unlike conventional
distillation methods that require separate teacher and student models, the
proposed framework utilizes a smoothed, historical version of the model itself
as the teacher, significantly reducing training computational overhead while
maintaining performance benefits. To support this research, we developed a
comprehensive accelerometer-based dataset capturing 12 distinct sleep postures
across three different wearing positions, complementing two existing public
datasets (MHealth and WISDM). Experimental results show that Smooth-Distill
consistently outperforms alternative approaches across different evaluation
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in both human activity recognition
and device placement detection tasks. This method demonstrates enhanced
stability in convergence patterns during training and exhibits reduced
overfitting compared to traditional multitask learning baselines. This
framework contributes to the practical implementation of knowledge distillation
in human activity recognition systems, offering an effective solution for
multitask learning with accelerometer data that balances accuracy and training
efficiency. More broadly, it reduces the computational cost of model training,
which is critical for scenarios requiring frequent model updates or training on
resource-constrained platforms. The code and model are available at

TL;DR: FPG introduces fractional calculus into policy gradients for long-term temporal modeling, reducing variance and improving sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy gradients suffer from Markovian assumptions, leading to high variance and inefficient sampling. FPG aims to address these issues by leveraging fractional calculus.

Method: FPG uses Caputo fractional derivatives to establish power-law temporal correlations and introduces a recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference errors.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows FPG reduces asymptotic variance (O(t^(-alpha))) and achieves 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction empirically.

Conclusion: FPG provides a mathematically grounded, computationally efficient framework for leveraging long-range dependencies in reinforcement learning.

Abstract: We propose Fractional Policy Gradients (FPG), a reinforcement learning
framework incorporating fractional calculus for long-term temporal modeling in
policy optimization. Standard policy gradient approaches face limitations from
Markovian assumptions, exhibiting high variance and inefficient sampling. By
reformulating gradients using Caputo fractional derivatives, FPG establishes
power-law temporal correlations between state transitions. We develop an
efficient recursive computation technique for fractional temporal-difference
errors with constant time and memory requirements. Theoretical analysis shows
FPG achieves asymptotic variance reduction of order O(t^(-alpha)) versus
standard policy gradients while preserving convergence. Empirical validation
demonstrates 35-68% sample efficiency gains and 24-52% variance reduction
versus state-of-the-art baselines. This framework provides a mathematically
grounded approach for leveraging long-range dependencies without computational
overhead.

### [189] [Theoretical Modeling of LLM Self-Improvement Training Dynamics Through Solver-Verifier Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00075)
*Yifan Sun,Yushan Liang,Zhen Zhang,Jiaye Teng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the dynamics of self-improvement in LLMs, introducing the solver-verifier gap concept to model performance evolution and predict outcomes early in training. It also examines the impact of external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLM performance evolves during self-improvement and the role of the solver-verifier gap, as well as the influence of external data.

Method: Theoretical modeling of self-improvement dynamics using the solver-verifier gap, with empirical validation on LLMs and datasets.

Result: The solver-verifier gap effectively explains performance enhancement, and early training data can predict final outcomes. Limited external data doesn't significantly alter performance.

Conclusion: The solver-verifier gap is key to understanding self-improvement in LLMs, and early predictions are feasible. External data's impact is minimal in limited regimes.

Abstract: Self-improvement is among the most prominent techniques within the realm of
large language models (LLM), aiming to enhance the LLM performance without
relying on external data. Despite its significance, generally how LLM
performances evolve during the self-improvement process remains underexplored.
In this paper, we theoretically model the training dynamics of self-improvement
via the concept of solver-verifier gap. This is inspired by the conjecture that
the performance enhancement of self-improvement stems from the gap between
LLM's solver capability and verifier capability. Based on the theoretical
framework, we further introduce how to predict the ultimate power of
self-improvement using only information from the first few training epochs. We
empirically validate the effectiveness of the theoretical model on various LLMs
and datasets. Beyond self-improvement, we extend our analysis to investigate
how external data influences these dynamics within the framework. Notably, we
find that under limited external data regimes, such external data can be
utilized at any stage without significantly affecting final performances, which
accords with the empirical observations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves the paradox of time series foundation models' cross-domain success by analyzing their representation learning and generalization, linking them to probabilistic extensions of language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why time series foundation models succeed in cross-domain transfer despite data reflecting distinct dynamical systems.

Method: Theoretical and experimental analysis of patch-based time series models, comparing their representation mechanisms to language models.

Result: Time series patches can be quantized into a discrete vocabulary with statistical properties similar to natural language, enabling robust transfer.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for understanding and improving large-scale time series foundation models.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models, the paradigm of training foundation
models with massive parameter counts on vast datasets has been adopted in
multiple domains to achieve remarkable success. Time series foundation models
represent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional
expressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,
this gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct
dynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet
this is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,
this paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,
the representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of
patch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not
merely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the
representation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic
vector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our
theoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous
time-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary
whose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural
language. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust
representation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby
explaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work
provides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and
improving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation
models.

Motivation: To improve meal detection accuracy and interpretability by leveraging dynamical features from CGM data.

Method: Extract dynamical modes from CGM data to identify meal-related patterns and anomalies.

Result: Enhanced detection accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamical feature-based approach outperforms traditional methods, offering robust and generalizable meal detection.

Abstract: We utilize dynamical modes as features derived from Continuous Glucose
Monitoring (CGM) data to detect meal events. By leveraging the inherent
properties of underlying dynamics, these modes capture key aspects of glucose
variability, enabling the identification of patterns and anomalies associated
with meal consumption. This approach not only improves the accuracy of meal
detection but also enhances the interpretability of the underlying glucose
dynamics. By focusing on dynamical features, our method provides a robust
framework for feature extraction, facilitating generalization across diverse
datasets and ensuring reliable performance in real-world applications. The
proposed technique offers significant advantages over traditional approaches,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedHLM is a hybrid language model framework combining SLMs and LLMs with federated learning to optimize token-level uncertainty thresholds, reducing LLM transmissions by 95% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HLMs face high communication overhead due to frequent offloading to LLMs for uncertain predictions. FedHLM aims to reduce this overhead efficiently.

Method: FedHLM integrates uncertainty-aware inference with federated learning, collaboratively learning thresholds and using P2P token resolution. It employs hierarchical model aggregation for refined routing policies.

Result: FedHLM reduces LLM transmissions by over 95% with negligible accuracy loss in large-scale news classification tasks.

Conclusion: FedHLM is scalable and efficient for edge-AI applications, significantly cutting communication costs while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Hybrid Language Models (HLMs) combine the low-latency efficiency of Small
Language Models (SLMs) on edge devices with the high accuracy of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on centralized servers. Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM
inference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when
local SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low
or entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still
require frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication
overhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,
a communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware
inference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in
collaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when
LLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned
thresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a
privacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages
embedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,
enabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without
engaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge
servers refine local routing policies through client updates, while
cross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered
design captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.
Experiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces
LLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it
well-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.

Motivation: Addressing gaps in current simulations for capturing causal links in the 'resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window' chain.

Method: Proposes IA-STGNN, integrating graph attention, counterfactual simulation, and spatial intervention node reconstruction.

Result: IA-STGNN reduces MAE by 12.8% and increases Top-5% accuracy by 18.4%, enhancing causal consistency.

Conclusion: IA-STGNN offers interpretable predictions for strategic delay, useful in policy modeling like nuclear deterrence and diplomacy.

Abstract: This study addresses the lack of structured causal modeling between tactical
strike behavior and strategic delay in current strategic-level simulations,
particularly the structural bottlenecks in capturing intermediate variables
within the "resilience - nodal suppression - negotiation window" chain. We
propose the Intervention-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (IA-STGNN),
a novel framework that closes the causal loop from tactical input to strategic
delay output. The model integrates graph attention mechanisms, counterfactual
simulation units, and spatial intervention node reconstruction to enable
dynamic simulations of strike configurations and synchronization strategies.
Training data are generated from a multi-physics simulation platform (GEANT4 +
COMSOL) under NIST SP 800-160 standards, ensuring structural traceability and
policy-level validation. Experimental results demonstrate that IA-STGNN
significantly outperforms baseline models (ST-GNN, GCN-LSTM, XGBoost),
achieving a 12.8 percent reduction in MAE and 18.4 percent increase in Top-5
percent accuracy, while improving causal path consistency and intervention
stability. IA-STGNN enables interpretable prediction of strategic delay and
supports applications such as nuclear deterrence simulation, diplomatic window
assessment, and multi-strategy optimization, providing a structured and
transparent AI decision-support mechanism for high-level policy modeling.

TL;DR: GFEN is a novel framework for traffic speed prediction, combining topological spatiotemporal graph fusion and hybrid methods to improve accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current traffic prediction methods struggle with complexity, non-linearity, and static techniques for non-stationary data, limiting accuracy and adaptability.

Method: GFEN uses topological spatiotemporal graph fusion and a hybrid approach (k-th order difference and attention-based deep learning) to model multi-scale features and smooth data.

Result: GFEN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 6.3% in accuracy and converges twice as fast as hybrid models.

Conclusion: GFEN enhances traffic prediction efficiency, demonstrating superior performance and potential for ITS applications.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS), yet current methods struggle with the inherent complexity and
non-linearity of traffic dynamics, making it difficult to integrate spatial and
temporal characteristics. Furthermore, existing approaches use static
techniques to address non-stationary and anomalous historical data, which
limits adaptability and undermines data smoothing. To overcome these
challenges, we propose the Graph Fusion Enhanced Network (GFEN), an innovative
framework for network-level traffic speed prediction. GFEN introduces a novel
topological spatiotemporal graph fusion technique that meticulously extracts
and merges spatial and temporal correlations from both data distribution and
network topology using trainable methods, enabling the modeling of multi-scale
spatiotemporal features. Additionally, GFEN employs a hybrid methodology
combining a k-th order difference-based mathematical framework with an
attention-based deep learning structure to adaptively smooth historical
observations and dynamically mitigate data anomalies and non-stationarity.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GFEN surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by approximately 6.3% in prediction accuracy and exhibits convergence rates
nearly twice as fast as recent hybrid models, confirming its superior
performance and potential to significantly enhance traffic prediction system
efficiency.

Result: Achieves 42.6% more identified peptides in immunopeptidomics, 60% more PSMs than de novo methods, and recovers 38.5% additional peptides.

Conclusion: pUniFind establishes a scalable, unified framework with enhanced sensitivity, modification coverage, and interpretability for proteomics.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced mass spectrometry data interpretation, yet most
models remain feature extractors rather than unified scoring frameworks. We
present pUniFind, the first large-scale multimodal pre-trained model in
proteomics that integrates end-to-end peptide-spectrum scoring with open,
zero-shot de novo sequencing. Trained on over 100 million open search-derived
spectra, pUniFind aligns spectral and peptide modalities via cross modality
prediction and outperforms traditional engines across diverse datasets,
particularly achieving a 42.6 percent increase in the number of identified
peptides in immunopeptidomics. Supporting over 1,300 modifications, pUniFind
identifies 60 percent more PSMs than existing de novo methods despite a
300-fold larger search space. A deep learning based quality control module
further recovers 38.5 percent additional peptides including 1,891 mapped to the
genome but absent from reference proteomes while preserving full fragment ion

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve workplace safety by predicting high-risk periods using routine safety inspection data.

Method: Uses binary time series modeling, sliding-window cross-validation, and compares machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, tree-based models, neural networks).

Result: LSTM network achieves 0.86 balanced accuracy, outperforming other methods in detecting high-risk periods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively converts inspection data into actionable weekly risk scores, aiding proactive safety planning.

Abstract: We propose a generic framework for short-term occupational accident
forecasting that leverages safety inspections and models accident occurrences
as binary time series. The approach generates daily predictions, which are then
aggregated into weekly safety assessments to better inform decision making. To
ensure the reliability and operational applicability of the forecasts, we apply
a sliding-window cross-validation procedure specifically designed for time
series data, combined with an evaluation based on aggregated period-level
metrics. Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression,
tree-based models, and neural networks, are trained and systematically compared
within this framework. Unlike the other approaches, the long short-term memory
(LSTM) network outperforms the other approaches and detects the upcoming
high-risk periods with a balanced accuracy of 0.86, confirming the robustness
of our methodology and demonstrating that a binary time series model can
anticipate these critical periods based on safety inspections. The proposed
methodology converts routine safety inspection data into clear weekly risk
scores, detecting the periods when accidents are most likely. Decision-makers
can integrate these scores into their planning tools to classify inspection
priorities, schedule targeted interventions, and funnel resources to the sites
or shifts classified as highest risk, stepping in before incidents occur and
getting the greatest return on safety investments.

*Corbeau Michael,Claeys Emmanuelle,Serrurier Mathieu,Zaraté Pascale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of data generation methods for firefighter resource allocation, evaluating their efficacy using domain-specific and standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing firefighter response through accurate data generation for scenario simulations.

Method: Examined Random Sampling, Tabular Variational Autoencoders, GANs, Conditional Tabular GANs, and Diffusion Probabilistic Models.

Result: Traditional metrics fall short; domain-specific metrics like response time and spatial-temporal distribution are crucial.

Conclusion: Synthetic data must capture complex correlations and anomalies to be operationally relevant for firefighting scenarios.

Abstract: Allocation of personnel and material resources is highly sensible in the case
of firefighter interventions. This allocation relies on simulations to
experiment with various scenarios. The main objective of this allocation is the
global optimization of the firefighters response. Data generation is then
mandatory to study various scenarios In this study, we propose to compare
different data generation methods. Methods such as Random Sampling, Tabular
Variational Autoencoders, standard Generative Adversarial Networks, Conditional
Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Probabilistic Models are
examined to ascertain their efficacy in capturing the intricacies of
firefighter interventions. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short in
capturing the nuanced requirements of synthetic datasets for real-world
scenarios. To address this gap, an evaluation of synthetic data quality is
conducted using a combination of domain-specific metrics tailored to the
firefighting domain and standard measures such as the Wasserstein distance.
Domain-specific metrics include response time distribution, spatial-temporal
distribution of interventions, and accidents representation. These metrics are
designed to assess data variability, the preservation of fine and complex
correlations and anomalies such as event with a very low occurrence, the
conformity with the initial statistical distribution and the operational
relevance of the synthetic data. The distribution has the particularity of
being highly unbalanced, none of the variables following a Gaussian
distribution, adding complexity to the data generation process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional regularization methods like Dropout or L2 decay lack global structural regularity. DFReg aims to address this by leveraging physics principles.

Conclusion: DFReg offers a novel, physics-based approach to regularization, enhancing weight distribution without traditional trade-offs.

Abstract: We introduce DFReg, a physics-inspired regularization method for deep neural
networks that operates on the global distribution of weights. Drawing from

traditional techniques such as Dropout or L2 decay, DFReg imposes global
structural regularity without architectural changes or stochastic
perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven, interpretable fault detection method for industrial quality control combines machine learning, Shapley explanations, and domain-specific visualization, achieving 95.9% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of adaptability in conventional quality control and the interpretability issues in data-driven methods for industrial applications.

Method: Integrates supervised machine learning for fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for interpretability, and domain-specific visualization. Evaluated via perturbation analysis and expert assessment.

Result: Achieves 95.9% fault detection accuracy with confirmed relevance and interpretability of explanations.

Conclusion: The human-centric approach enhances trust in data-driven fault detection, advancing industrial quality control.

Abstract: Ensuring consistent product quality in modern manufacturing is crucial,
particularly in safety-critical applications. Conventional quality control
approaches, reliant on manually defined thresholds and features, lack
adaptability to the complexity and variability inherent in production data and
necessitate extensive domain expertise. Conversely, data-driven methods, such
as machine learning, demonstrate high detection performance but typically
function as black-box models, thereby limiting their acceptance in industrial
environments where interpretability is paramount. This paper introduces a
methodology for industrial fault detection, which is both data-driven and
transparent. The approach integrates a supervised machine learning model for
multi-class fault classification, Shapley Additive Explanations for post-hoc
interpretability, and a do-main-specific visualisation technique that maps
model explanations to operator-interpretable features. Furthermore, the study
proposes an evaluation methodology that assesses model explanations through
quantitative perturbation analysis and evaluates visualisations by qualitative
expert assessment. The approach was applied to the crimping process, a
safety-critical joining technique, using a dataset of univariate, discrete time
series. The system achieves a fault detection accuracy of 95.9 %, and both
quantitative selectivity analysis and qualitative expert evaluations confirmed
the relevance and inter-pretability of the generated explanations. This
human-centric approach is designed to enhance trust and interpretability in
data-driven fault detection, thereby contributing to applied system design in
industrial quality control.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models are adapted for text-to-level generation in games, using automated captioning and simple transformers, outperforming other methods in efficiency and playability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored use of diffusion models for text-to-level generation in games, addressing practical needs like caption/level pairs and playable level generation.

Method: Automated caption assignment to levels, training diffusion models with pretrained and simple transformer text encoders, and comparing input/output caption overlap.

Result: The best diffusion model uses a simple transformer, trains faster, and outperforms unconditional diffusion models, GANs, and other text-to-level approaches.

Conclusion: Simple transformers suffice for text embedding in diffusion models, and a GUI enables designers to create long levels from generated scenes.

Abstract: Recent research shows how diffusion models can unconditionally generate
tile-based game levels, but use of diffusion models for text-to-level
generation is underexplored. There are practical considerations for creating a
usable model: caption/level pairs are needed, as is a text embedding model, and
a way of generating entire playable levels, rather than individual scenes. We
present strategies to automatically assign descriptive captions to an existing
level dataset, and train diffusion models using both pretrained text encoders
and simple transformer models trained from scratch. Captions are automatically
assigned to generated levels so that the degree of overlap between input and
output captions can be compared. We also assess the diversity and playability
of the resulting levels. Results are compared with an unconditional diffusion
model and a generative adversarial network, as well as the text-to-level
approaches Five-Dollar Model and MarioGPT. Notably, the best diffusion model
uses a simple transformer model for text embedding, and takes less time to
train than diffusion models employing more complex text encoders, indicating
that reliance on larger language models is not necessary. We also present a GUI
allowing designers to construct long levels from model-generated scenes.

TL;DR: A foundation model for wearable behavioral data improves health predictions, outperforming raw sensor data in tasks like sleep prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavioral data from wearables is often more informative than low-level sensor data for health predictions, but lacks tailored foundation models.

Method: Developed foundation models using 2.5B hours of wearable data from 162K individuals, optimizing architectures and tokenization strategies.

Result: Strong performance across 57 health tasks, excelling in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, especially when combined with raw sensor data.

Conclusion: Tailoring foundation models to wearables enhances health predictions and enables new applications.

Abstract: Wearable devices record physiological and behavioral signals that can improve
health predictions. While foundation models are increasingly used for such
predictions, they have been primarily applied to low-level sensor data, despite
behavioral data often being more informative due to their alignment with
physiologically relevant timescales and quantities. We develop foundation
models of such behavioral signals using over 2.5B hours of wearable data from
162K individuals, systematically optimizing architectures and tokenization
strategies for this unique dataset. Evaluated on 57 health-related tasks, our
model shows strong performance across diverse real-world applications including
individual-level classification and time-varying health state prediction. The
model excels in behavior-driven tasks like sleep prediction, and improves
further when combined with representations of raw sensor data. These results
underscore the importance of tailoring foundation model design to wearables and
demonstrate the potential to enable new health applications.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Local SGD in distributed/federated optimization under data heterogeneity, showing bounded second-order heterogeneity is key for outperforming centralized methods. It provides tight bounds and a consensus-error framework for convergence, extending to online federated learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and why local update algorithms like Local SGD outperform centralized methods in heterogeneous data settings.

Method: Uses a fine-grained consensus-error analysis framework under third-order smoothness and relaxed heterogeneity assumptions. Establishes tight bounds for various local update algorithms.

Result: Shows bounded second-order heterogeneity is necessary and sufficient for Local SGD's advantage. Provides min-max complexity for problem classes and regret bounds for online federated learning.

Conclusion: Local updates like Local SGD have provable advantages under specific heterogeneity conditions, offering a guide for analyzing such methods in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: This thesis contributes to the theoretical understanding of local update
algorithms, especially Local SGD, in distributed and federated optimization
under realistic models of data heterogeneity. A central focus is on the bounded
second-order heterogeneity assumption, which is shown to be both necessary and
sufficient for local updates to outperform centralized or mini-batch methods in
convex and non-convex settings. The thesis establishes tight upper and lower
bounds in several regimes for various local update algorithms and characterizes
the min-max complexity of multiple problem classes. At its core is a
fine-grained consensus-error-based analysis framework that yields sharper
finite-time convergence bounds under third-order smoothness and relaxed
heterogeneity assumptions. The thesis also extends to online federated
learning, providing fundamental regret bounds under both first-order and bandit
feedback. Together, these results clarify when and why local updates offer
provable advantages, and the thesis serves as a self-contained guide for
analyzing Local SGD in heterogeneous environments.

TL;DR: PPFL-RDSN combines Federated Learning, local differential privacy, and model watermarking for secure, privacy-preserving high-quality image reconstruction from low-resolution inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training for image reconstruction poses privacy risks (data leakage, inference attacks) and high computational costs.

Method: Integrates Federated Learning, local differential privacy, and robust model watermarking to keep data secure on local devices.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to centralized methods, reduces computational burden, and mitigates security/privacy risks.

Conclusion: PPFL-RDSN is a practical solution for secure, privacy-preserving collaborative computer vision applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-quality images from low-resolution inputs using Residual
Dense Spatial Networks (RDSNs) is crucial yet challenging, particularly in
collaborative scenarios where centralized training poses significant privacy
risks, including data leakage and inference attacks, as well as high
computational costs. We propose a novel Privacy-Preserving Federated
Learning-based RDSN (PPFL-RDSN) framework specifically tailored for lossy image
reconstruction. PPFL-RDSN integrates Federated Learning (FL), local
differential privacy, and robust model watermarking techniques, ensuring data
remains secure on local devices, safeguarding sensitive information, and
maintaining model authenticity without revealing underlying data. Empirical
evaluations show that PPFL-RDSN achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art centralized methods while reducing computational burdens, and
effectively mitigates security and privacy vulnerabilities, making it a
practical solution for secure and privacy-preserving collaborative computer

TL;DR: A novel framework combines ResNet and Transformer heatmaps for improved model interpretability, addressing spatial-temporal misalignment and achieving high accuracy in clinical and industrial applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods suffer from spatial-temporal misalignment, limiting actionable insights in critical domains like healthcare and industrial monitoring.

Method: Integrates gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, ensuring spatial-temporal alignment and real-time performance.

Result: Achieves 94.1% accuracy on ECG arrhythmia detection and reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh on energy prediction, outperforming baselines by 3.8-12.4%.

Conclusion: The framework bridges technical outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering scalable, transparent decision-making with causal fidelity and alignment.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing model
interpretability by integrating heatmaps produced separately by ResNet and a
restructured 2D Transformer with globally weighted input saliency. We address
the critical problem of spatial-temporal misalignment in existing
interpretability methods, where convolutional networks fail to capture global
context and Transformers lack localized precision - a limitation that impedes
actionable insights in safety-critical domains like healthcare and industrial
monitoring. Our method merges gradient-weighted activation maps (ResNet) and
Transformer attention rollout into a unified visualization, achieving full
spatial-temporal alignment while preserving real-time performance. Empirical
evaluations on clinical (ECG arrhythmia detection) and industrial (energy
consumption prediction) datasets demonstrate significant improvements: the
hybrid framework achieves 94.1% accuracy (F1 0.93) on the PhysioNet dataset and
reduces regression error to RMSE = 0.28 kWh (R2 = 0.95) on the UCI Energy
Appliance dataset-outperforming standalone ResNet, Transformer, and
InceptionTime baselines by 3.8-12.4%. An NLP module translates fused heatmaps
into domain-specific narratives (e.g., "Elevated ST-segment between 2-4 seconds
suggests myocardial ischemia"), validated via BLEU-4 (0.586) and ROUGE-L
(0.650) scores. By formalizing interpretability as causal fidelity and
spatial-temporal alignment, our approach bridges the gap between technical
outputs and stakeholder understanding, offering a scalable solution for
transparent, time-aware decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL benchmarks lack real-world complexities, hindering progress in deploying RL in practical applications.

Method: Developed Gym4ReaL, a suite of diverse tasks simulating real-world challenges for RL evaluation.

Result: Standard RL algorithms perform well against rule-based benchmarks in these realistic settings.

Conclusion: Gym4ReaL highlights the need for new RL methods to handle real-world complexities effectively.

Abstract: In recent years, \emph{Reinforcement Learning} (RL) has made remarkable
progress, achieving superhuman performance in a wide range of simulated
environments. As research moves toward deploying RL in real-world applications,
the field faces a new set of challenges inherent to real-world settings, such
as large state-action spaces, non-stationarity, and partial observability.
Despite their importance, these challenges are often underexplored in current
benchmarks, which tend to focus on idealized, fully observable, and stationary
environments, often neglecting to incorporate real-world complexities
explicitly. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Gym4ReaL}, a comprehensive
suite of realistic environments designed to support the development and
evaluation of RL algorithms that can operate in real-world scenarios. The suite
includes a diverse set of tasks that expose algorithms to a variety of
practical challenges. Our experimental results show that, in these settings,
standard RL algorithms confirm their competitiveness against rule-based
benchmarks, motivating the development of new methods to fully exploit the
potential of RL to tackle the complexities of real-world tasks.

TL;DR: FEDMOSAIC introduces adaptive collaboration in federated learning, allowing clients to decide whom to trust at the example level, improving performance over existing PFL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning, where many PFL methods fail to outperform local or centralized baselines due to mismatched collaboration structures.

Method: FEDMOSAIC uses federated co-training, where clients exchange predictions over shared unlabeled data, enabling fine-grained trust decisions and adaptive loss weighting based on agreement between private and public data.

Result: FEDMOSAIC outperforms state-of-the-art PFL methods in diverse non-IID settings and provides convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: Data-aware collaboration, as demonstrated by FEDMOSAIC, offers robust and effective personalization in federated learning.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a central challenge in federated learning, and
personalized federated learning (PFL) aims to address it by tailoring models to
each client's distribution. Yet many PFL methods fail to outperform local or
centralized baselines, suggesting a mismatch between the collaboration they
enforce and the structure of the data. We propose an approach based on adaptive
collaboration, where clients decide adaptively not only how much to rely on
others, but also whom to trust at the level of individual examples. We
instantiate this principle in FEDMOSAIC, a federated co-training method in
which clients exchange predictions over a shared unlabeled dataset. This
enables fine-grained trust decisions that are difficult to achieve with
parameter sharing alone. Each client adjusts its loss weighting based on the
agreement between private and public data, and contributes to global
pseudo-labels in proportion to its estimated per-example confidence.
Empirically, FEDMOSAIC improves upon state-of-the-art PFL methods across
diverse non-IID settings, and we provide convergence guarantees under standard
assumptions. Our results demonstrate the potential of data-aware collaboration
for robust and effective personalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores how reject relations affect stimulus equivalence (SE) in computational models, comparing neural networks (FFNs, BERT, GPT) to a probabilistic agent. Results suggest reliance on associative learning, not SE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the contentious role of reject relations in SE formation and assess whether neural networks truly demonstrate SE or just associative learning.

Method: Used FFNs, BERT, and GPT in 18 MTS simulation conditions, varying training structure, relation type, and negative comparison selection. A probabilistic agent served as a benchmark.

Result: Reject relations influenced performance; high accuracy in some cases mirrored the probabilistic agent, indicating associative learning, not SE.

Conclusion: Neural networks may rely on associative strategies, highlighting the need for stricter criteria in SE computational models.

Abstract: Simulations offer a valuable tool for exploring stimulus equivalence (SE),
yet the potential of reject relations to disrupt the assessment of equivalence
class formation is contentious. This study investigates the role of reject
relations in the acquisition of stimulus equivalence using computational
models. We examined feedforward neural networks (FFNs), bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT), and generative pre-trained
transformers (GPT) across 18 conditions in matching-to-sample (MTS)
simulations. Conditions varied in training structure (linear series,
one-to-many, and many-to-one), relation type (select-only, reject-only, and
select-reject), and negative comparison selection (standard and biased). A
probabilistic agent served as a benchmark, embodying purely associative
learning. The primary goal was to determine whether artificial neural networks
could demonstrate equivalence class formation or whether their performance
reflected associative learning. Results showed that reject relations influenced
agent performance. While some agents achieved high accuracy on equivalence
tests, particularly with reject relations and biased negative comparisons, this
performance was comparable to the probabilistic agent. These findings suggest
that artificial neural networks, including transformer models, may rely on
associative strategies rather than SE. This underscores the need for careful
consideration of reject relations and more stringent criteria in computational
models of equivalence.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL) to address overestimation in deep RL, showing it outperforms Double DQN in reducing overestimation and improving performance across 57 Atari games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overestimation is a common issue in RL, particularly in Q-learning and its deep variants like DQN. Double Q-learning was proposed to mitigate this, but its deep adaptation (Double DQN) lacks the full benefits of training two Q-functions. This paper explores DDQL to better address overestimation.

Method: The study adapts Double Q-learning's core idea for deep RL, training two Q-functions that bootstrap off each other (DDQL). It evaluates DDQL against Double DQN, analyzing aspects like network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling.

Result: DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms Double DQN across 57 Atari 2600 games without needing extra hyperparameters.

Conclusion: DDQL effectively mitigates overestimation in deep RL and offers superior performance compared to Double DQN, demonstrating its potential as a robust algorithm for value-based deep RL.

Abstract: Overestimation is pervasive in reinforcement learning (RL), including in
Q-learning, which forms the algorithmic basis for many value-based deep RL
algorithms. Double Q-learning is an algorithm introduced to address
Q-learning's overestimation by training two Q-functions and using both to
de-correlate action-selection and action-evaluation in bootstrap targets.
Shortly after Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of deep Q-networks
(DQN), Double Q-learning was adapted to deep RL in the form of Double DQN.
However, Double DQN only loosely adapts Double Q-learning, forgoing the
training of two different Q-functions that bootstrap off one another. In this
paper, we study algorithms that adapt this core idea of Double Q-learning for
value-based deep RL. We term such algorithms Deep Double Q-learning (DDQL). Our
aim is to understand whether DDQL exhibits less overestimation than Double DQN
and whether performant instantiations of DDQL exist. We answer both questions
affirmatively, demonstrating that DDQL reduces overestimation and outperforms
Double DQN in aggregate across 57 Atari 2600 games, without requiring
additional hyperparameters. We also study several aspects of DDQL, including
its network architecture, replay ratio, and minibatch sampling strategy.

TL;DR: Structure-preserving Lift & Learn method uses energy-quadratization to learn reduced-order models for nonlinear PDEs with conservation laws, ensuring physics-respecting and efficient results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for learning reduced-order models of nonlinear PDEs that preserves structure and respects underlying physics.

Method: Hybrid learning approach combining energy-quadratization for quadratic lifted systems and constrained optimization to learn linear reduced operators.

Result: Computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models validated on three numerical examples, showing competitive accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: The method generalizes well and is competitive with state-of-the-art structure-preserving model reduction techniques.

Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift & Learn, a scientific machine
learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn
structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential
equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach
based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses
knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent
quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics
obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making
model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted
quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms
analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained
optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a
structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields
computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the
underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the
generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed
structure-preserving Lift & Learn method through three numerical examples: the
one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the
two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional
Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed
learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving
data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational
efficiency.

TL;DR: MamNet integrates time-domain and frequency-domain modeling for network traffic prediction and anomaly detection, outperforming recent models by 2-4% in accuracy, recall, and F1-Score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abnormal network traffic fluctuations indicate security threats or failures, necessitating efficient prediction and detection methods.

Method: MamNet uses Mamba for time-domain modeling and Fourier Transform for frequency-domain feature extraction, fusing multi-scale information for anomaly detection.

Result: Experiments on UNSW-NB15 and CAIDA datasets show MamNet's superior performance, especially for complex traffic patterns and long-term trends.

Conclusion: MamNet effectively detects anomalies across time scales and is suitable for network security. Future work includes optimizing with external event data.

Abstract: The abnormal fluctuations in network traffic may indicate potential security
threats or system failures. Therefore, efficient network traffic prediction and
anomaly detection methods are crucial for network security and traffic
management. This paper proposes a novel network traffic prediction and anomaly
detection model, MamNet, which integrates time-domain modeling and
frequency-domain feature extraction. The model first captures the long-term
dependencies of network traffic through the Mamba module (time-domain
modeling), and then identifies periodic fluctuations in the traffic using
Fourier Transform (frequency-domain feature extraction). In the feature fusion
layer, multi-scale information is integrated to enhance the model's ability to
detect network traffic anomalies. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 and
CAIDA datasets demonstrate that MamNet outperforms several recent mainstream
models in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. Specifically, it achieves an
improvement of approximately 2% to 4% in detection performance for complex
traffic patterns and long-term trend detection. The results indicate that
MamNet effectively captures anomalies in network traffic across different time
scales and is suitable for anomaly detection tasks in network security and
traffic management. Future work could further optimize the model structure by
incorporating external network event information, thereby improving the model's
adaptability and stability in complex network environments.

TL;DR: AutoDS introduces a method for open-ended autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) using Bayesian surprise and Monte Carlo tree search, outperforming competitors by generating more surprising discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASD methods rely on human-specified questions or flawed heuristics, limiting exploration. AutoDS aims to accelerate discovery by letting AI drive exploration using Bayesian surprise.

Method: AutoDS employs Bayesian surprise to quantify epistemic shifts and uses Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with progressive widening for hypothesis exploration.

Result: AutoDS outperforms competitors, producing 5-29% more surprising discoveries across 21 datasets. Two-thirds of its findings were surprising to domain experts.

Conclusion: AutoDS represents progress in open-ended ASD, demonstrating the potential of AI-driven exploration using Bayesian surprise.

Abstract: The promise of autonomous scientific discovery (ASD) hinges not only on
answering questions, but also on knowing which questions to ask. Most recent
works in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven
settings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis
generation. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by
allowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few
existing approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity
heuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former
struggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the
latter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a
method for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using
Bayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior
beliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering
experimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,
our method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive
widening using surprisal as the reward function. We evaluate AutoDS in the
setting of data-driven discovery across 21 real-world datasets spanning domains
such as biology, economics, finance, and behavioral science. Our results
demonstrate that under a fixed budget, AutoDS substantially outperforms
competitors by producing 5--29\% more discoveries deemed surprising by the LLM.
Our human evaluation further finds that two-thirds of AutoDS discoveries are
surprising to the domain experts, suggesting this is an important step forward
towards building open-ended ASD systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual
reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to
improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management
advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in
extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints,
and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between
model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we
propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale
$\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The
novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal
features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then
enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization
(DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT
image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited
data for RRG tasks.

*Christiana Westlin,Ashutosh Singh,Deniz Erdogmus,Georgios Stratis,Lisa Feldman Barrett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that emotion categories are biologically and psychologically distinct, showing significant variation in brain patterns within categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To question the widely accepted typological view of emotion categories and demonstrate how starting assumptions influence scientific conclusions.

Method: Reanalyzed data from a typologically-guided study using minimal assumptions about variance, focusing on variation within emotion categories.

Result: Found significant variation in brain patterns within emotion categories, contradicting the original mappings.

Conclusion: Scientific conclusions are shaped by starting assumptions, and hypotheses should be tested with multiple methods for robustness.

Abstract: In the science of emotion, it is widely assumed that folk emotion categories
form a biological and psychological typology, and studies are routinely
designed and analyzed to identify emotion-specific patterns. This approach
shapes the observations that studies report, ultimately reinforcing the
assumption that guided the investigation. Here, we reanalyzed data from one
such typologically-guided study that reported mappings between individual brain
patterns and group-averaged ratings of 34 emotion categories. Our reanalysis
was guided by an alternative view of emotion categories as populations of
variable, situated instances, and which predicts a priori that there will be
significant variation in brain patterns within a category across instances.
Correspondingly, our analysis made minimal assumptions about the structure of
the variance present in the data. As predicted, we did not observe the original
mappings and instead observed significant variation across individuals. These
findings demonstrate how starting assumptions can ultimately impact scientific
conclusions and suggest that a hypothesis must be supported using multiple
analytic methods before it is taken seriously.

*Yilie Huang,Xun Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive exploration mechanism for RL in continuous-time stochastic LQ control problems, improving efficiency and matching sublinear regret bounds without extensive tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require extensive tuning and ignore learning progress, limiting efficiency and practicality in RL for LQ control problems.

Method: Proposes a model-free, data-driven approach with adaptive entropy regularization and policy variance adjustments by the critic and actor.

Result: Achieves sublinear regret matching best-known model-free results, with numerical experiments showing faster convergence and better regret performance.

Conclusion: Adaptive exploration enhances learning efficiency and performance in RL for LQ problems, outperforming non-adaptive methods.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning (RL) for the same class of continuous-time
stochastic linear--quadratic (LQ) control problems as in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, where volatilities depend on both states and
controls while states are scalar-valued and running control rewards are absent.
We propose a model-free, data-driven exploration mechanism that adaptively
adjusts entropy regularization by the critic and policy variance by the actor.
Unlike the constant or deterministic exploration schedules employed in
\cite{huang2024sublinear}, which require extensive tuning for implementations
and ignore learning progresses during iterations, our adaptive exploratory
approach boosts learning efficiency with minimal tuning. Despite its
flexibility, our method achieves a sublinear regret bound that matches the
best-known model-free results for this class of LQ problems, which were
previously derived only with fixed exploration schedules. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that adaptive explorations accelerate convergence and improve
regret performance compared to the non-adaptive model-free and model-based
counterparts.

*Geng Zhang,Yuxuan Han,Yuxuan Lou,Wangbo Zhao,Yiqi Zhang,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoNE is a novel expert pruning method for MoE models, replacing redundant experts with lightweight novices to reduce memory overhead while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the memory inefficiency of MoE models by pruning redundant experts without significant performance loss.

Method: MoNE evaluates expert redundancy using access frequency and output variance, replacing low-usage experts with lightweight novices.

Result: MoNE outperforms baselines, improving zero-shot accuracy by up to 3.61 under 50% pruning.

Conclusion: MoNE is an effective and robust method for compressing MoE models with minimal performance degradation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) enables efficient scaling of large language models
by activating only a subset of experts per input token. However, deploying
MoE-based models incurs significant memory overhead due to the need to retain
all experts in memory. While structured pruning is promising to reduce memory
costs, existing methods often show suboptimal performance and unstable
degradation in three dimensions: model architectures, calibration data sources,
and calibration sample sizes. This paper proposes
Mixture-of-Novices-and-Experts (MoNE), a novel expert pruning method that
replaces redundant experts with lightweight novices to achieve effective and
robust model compression. MoNE evaluates expert redundancy based on two
metrics: access frequency and output variance. Experts exhibiting low usage and
stable outputs are pruned and replaced with lightweight novices-unbiased
estimations of their original outputs-minimizing performance degradation.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE consistently outperforms baseline
methods with minimal accuracy degradation across the three dimensions,
confirming its effectiveness and robustness. Notably, it improves the average
zero shot accuracy across nine downstream tasks by up to 2.71 under 25\%
pruning ratio and 3.61 under 50\% pruning. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HelixPipe improves pipeline parallelism for long-sequence transformer training by optimizing attention computation and memory usage, achieving better throughput and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pipeline parallelism methods perform poorly with long transformer sequences due to quadratic attention computation and high memory overhead.

Method: HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, a two-fold micro batch schedule, and recomputation techniques to reduce pipeline bubbles and memory fragmentation.

Result: HelixPipe outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 26% speedup for a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 GPUs.

Conclusion: HelixPipe is effective for long-sequence transformer training, offering superior performance and scalability.

Abstract: As transformer sequence lengths grow, existing pipeline parallelisms incur
suboptimal performance due to the quadratic attention computation and the
substantial memory overhead. To relieve these challenges, we propose HelixPipe,
a novel pipeline parallelism for long sequence transformer training. First,
HelixPipe introduces attention parallel partition, which schedules attention
computations of different micro batches across different pipeline stages in
parallel, reducing pipeline bubbles. Second, it employs a two-fold
first-in-last-out micro batch schedule to balance memory usage and overlap
communication with computation. Additionally, HelixPipe utilizes recomputation
without attention and chunked MLP to mitigate fragmentation and enable longer
sequences. Experiments demonstrate that HelixPipe gains increasing advantages
with longer sequence lengths, and outperforms existing methods in throughput
and scalability across varying pipeline sizes, model sizes, and cluster
configurations. Notably, it achieves a 26\% speedup over baseline methods when
training a 7B model with 128k sequence length on 64 H20 GPUs. Code is available

*Jinfu Fan,Xiaohui Zhong,Kangrui Ren,Jiangnan Li,Linqing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes DDMP, a diffusion disambiguation model for partial label learning (PLL), leveraging diffusion models to denoise ambiguous labels and improve classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of learning from ambiguous labels in machine learning by exploring diffusion models' potential to denoise and disambiguate labels.

Method: Reformulates label disambiguation as a generative process using diffusion models, constructs pseudo-clean labels, and introduces a transition-aware matrix for dynamic label estimation.

Result: DDMP demonstrates improved performance in PLL tasks, effectively refining ground-truth labels during training.

Conclusion: DDMP is a suitable and effective approach for partial label learning, leveraging diffusion models to enhance label disambiguation and classification.

Abstract: Learning from ambiguous labels is a long-standing problem in practical
machine learning applications. The purpose of \emph{partial label learning}
(PLL) is to identify the ground-truth label from a set of candidate labels
associated with a given instance. Inspired by the remarkable performance of
diffusion models in various generation tasks, this paper explores their
potential to denoise ambiguous labels through the reverse denoising process.
Therefore, this paper reformulates the label disambiguation problem from the
perspective of generative models, where labels are generated by iteratively
refining initial random guesses. This perspective enables the diffusion model
to learn how label information is generated stochastically. By modeling the
generation uncertainty, we can use the maximum likelihood estimate of the label
for classification inference. However, such ambiguous labels lead to a mismatch
between instance and label, which reduces the quality of generated data. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a \emph{diffusion disambiguation model
for PLL} (DDMP), which first uses the potential complementary information
between instances and labels to construct pseudo-clean labels for initial
diffusion training. Furthermore, a transition-aware matrix is introduced to
estimate the potential ground-truth labels, which are dynamically updated
during the diffusion generation. During training, the ground-truth label is
progressively refined, improving the classifier. Experiments show the advantage
of the DDMP and its suitability for PLL.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TarFlowLM, a framework that shifts language modeling from discrete tokens to a continuous latent space using autoregressive normalizing flows, enabling flexible modeling and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore new modeling flexibility beyond traditional discrete token-based autoregressive models by leveraging continuous latent spaces.

Method: Proposes TarFlowLM, using transformer-based autoregressive normalizing flows to model continuous representations, with novel mixture-based coupling transformations.

Result: Demonstrates strong likelihood performance and flexible modeling capabilities on language benchmarks.

Conclusion: TarFlowLM offers a promising alternative to discrete autoregressive models, with enhanced flexibility and performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have driven remarkable progress in language modeling.
Their foundational reliance on discrete tokens, unidirectional context, and
single-pass decoding, while central to their success, also inspires the
exploration of a design space that could offer new axes of modeling
flexibility. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm, shifting
language modeling from a discrete token space to a continuous latent space. We
propose a novel framework TarFlowLM, that employs transformer-based
autoregressive normalizing flows to model these continuous representations.
This approach unlocks substantial flexibility, enabling the construction of
models that can capture global bi-directional context through stacked,
alternating-direction autoregressive transformations, support block-wise
generation with flexible token patch sizes, and facilitate a hierarchical
multi-pass generation process. We further propose new mixture-based coupling
transformations designed to capture complex dependencies within the latent
space shaped by discrete data, and demonstrate theoretical connections to
conventional discrete autoregressive models. Extensive experiments on language
modeling benchmarks demonstrate strong likelihood performance and highlight the
flexible modeling capabilities inherent in our framework.

TL;DR: The paper introduces causal graph regression (CGR) to address the overlooked challenge of regression tasks in causal graph learning, adapting causal intervention techniques from classification to regression using contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression tasks in graph learning are more challenging and underexplored compared to classification, despite the success of causal graph learning (CGL) in improving generalizability under OOD scenarios.

Method: The authors reshape the handling of confounding effects in CGL for classification, generalize causal intervention techniques to regression via contrastive learning, and validate their approach on graph OOD benchmarks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed CGR method.

Conclusion: The work successfully adapts causal graph learning techniques to regression tasks, providing a validated approach and open-source implementation.

Abstract: Through recognizing causal subgraphs, causal graph learning (CGL) has risen
to be a promising approach for improving the generalizability of graph neural
networks under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. However, the empirical
successes of CGL techniques are mostly exemplified in classification settings,
while regression tasks, a more challenging setting in graph learning, are
overlooked. We thus devote this work to tackling causal graph regression (CGR);
to this end we reshape the processing of confounding effects in existing CGL
studies, which mainly deal with classification. Specifically, we reflect on the
predictive power of confounders in graph-level regression, and generalize
classification-specific causal intervention techniques to regression through a
lens of contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on graph OOD benchmarks
validate the efficacy of our proposals for CGR. The model implementation and
the code are provided on https://github.com/causal-graph/CGR.

TL;DR: Proposes an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework for diffusion models to optimize for non-differentiable reward functions in biomolecular design, improving stability and sample efficiency over RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require diffusion models to optimize for non-differentiable rewards (e.g., physics-based simulation), but RL methods face instability and inefficiency.

Method: Uses policy distillation: collects off-policy data, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies, and updates the model via KL divergence minimization.

Result: Demonstrates superior reward optimization in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively fine-tunes diffusion models for reward-guided generation, outperforming existing RL-based approaches.

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided
generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly
effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world
applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring
optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions
such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.
Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such
objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode
collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative
distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to
optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy
distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates
reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by
minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the
current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence
minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to
existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and
superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein,
small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of efficient long-context modeling in NLP by improving state-space models (SSMs) through a novel synthetic task (joint recall) and integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient long-context modeling is critical for NLP, but Transformers scale poorly with sequence length, and SSMs struggle with long-range dependencies.

Method: Proposes joint recall as a better synthetic task, integrates SSMs with CDSA, and introduces HAX for practical NLP applications.

Result: HAX outperforms SSM baselines and SSMs with context-independent sparse attention (CISA) on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed HAX method effectively bridges the gap between theoretical analysis and practical long-context modeling, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Efficient long-context modeling remains a critical challenge for natural
language processing (NLP), as the time complexity of the predominant
Transformer architecture scales quadratically with the sequence length. While
state-space models (SSMs) offer alternative sub-quadratic solutions, they
struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively. In this work, we focus
on analyzing and improving the long-context modeling capabilities of SSMs. We
show that the widely used synthetic task, associative recall, which requires a
model to recall a value associated with a single key without context,
insufficiently represents the complexities of real-world long-context modeling.
To address this limitation, we extend the associative recall to a novel
synthetic task, \emph{joint recall}, which requires a model to recall the value
associated with a key given in a specified context. Theoretically, we prove
that SSMs do not have the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall in
sub-quadratic time complexity. To resolve this issue, we propose a solution
based on integrating SSMs with Context-Dependent Sparse Attention (CDSA), which
has the expressiveness to solve multi-query joint recall with sub-quadratic
computation. To bridge the gap between theoretical analysis and real-world
applications, we propose locality-sensitive Hashing Attention with sparse Key
Selection (HAX), which instantiates the theoretical solution and is further
tailored to natural language domains. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world long-context benchmarks show that HAX consistently outperforms
SSM baselines and SSMs integrated with context-independent sparse attention
(CISA).

TL;DR: An efficient method (Optimistic-WS) for identifying top-performing algorithms in multi-task domains using multi-armed bandits, showing improved regret reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately identify the best algorithm for each sub-task in multi-problem domains, especially where algorithm runtimes are high.

Method: Treats the problem as best arm identification in multi-armed bandits, using an optimistic selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS).

Result: Substantial performance improvement in average simple regret compared to previous methods, tested on GVGAI and Ludii game domains.

Conclusion: Optimistic-WS enhances agent evaluation quality in general game frameworks and other multi-task domains.

Abstract: We present an efficient and generalised procedure to accurately identify the
best performing algorithm for each sub-task in a multi-problem domain. Our
approach treats this as a set of best arm identification problems for
multi-armed bandits, where each bandit corresponds to a specific task and each
arm corresponds to a specific algorithm or agent. We propose an optimistic
selection process based on the Wilson score interval (Optimistic-WS) that ranks
each arm across all bandits in terms of their potential regret reduction. We
evaluate the performance of Optimistic-WS on two of the most popular general
game domains, the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework and the Ludii general
game playing system, with the goal of identifying the highest performing agent
for each game within a limited number of trials. Compared to previous best arm
identification algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our results demonstrate a
substantial performance improvement in terms of average simple regret. This
novel approach can be used to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of
agent evaluation procedures for general game frameworks, as well as other
multi-task domains with high algorithm runtimes.

Motivation: To handle both short-range and long-range dependencies efficiently without quadratic attention cost.

Method: Combines global attention with chunked local attention and a gated FIFO memory mechanism, using rotary positional encoding for disentangled positional signals.

Result: A lightweight, extensible model suitable for dialogue modeling, code completion, and document understanding.

Conclusion: The architecture offers an efficient and modular solution for long-context language tasks.

Abstract: We present a Transformer architecture for long-context language modeling that

local attention and a gated FIFO memory mechanism. This unified attention block
allows the model to efficiently handle both short-range and long-range
dependencies without increasing attention cost quadratically. The memory module
persistently stores past token representations using a gated update mechanism
inspired by recurrent networks. Rotary positional encoding is applied per
attention head to enable directionally disentangled, scale-invariant positional
signals. The architecture is implemented entirely from scratch in PyTorch, with
no reliance on high-level libraries, enabling transparent and modular
experimentation. Our model offers a lightweight and extensible design for tasks

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A refined Random Forest (RF) classifier is proposed to reduce inference cost and redundancy by dynamically growing trees on informative features and enforcing diversity through clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RF relies on many trees and all features, leading to high costs and redundancy. The goal is to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The model iteratively removes uninformative features, grows new trees as needed, and uses correlation-based clustering to eliminate redundant trees.

Result: Experiments on 8 benchmark datasets show improved accuracy over standard RF with the same number of trees.

Conclusion: The refined RF classifier offers better accuracy and efficiency by focusing on informative features and diverse trees.

Abstract: Random Forest (RF) is a widely used ensemble learning technique known for its
robust classification performance across diverse domains. However, it often
relies on hundreds of trees and all input features, leading to high inference
cost and model redundancy. In this work, our goal is to grow trees dynamically
only on informative features and then enforce maximal diversity by clustering
and retaining uncorrelated trees. Therefore, we propose a Refined Random Forest
Classifier that iteratively refines itself by first removing the least
informative features and then analytically determines how many new trees should
be grown, followed by correlation-based clustering to remove redundant trees.
The classification accuracy of our model was compared against the standard RF
on the same number of trees. Experiments on 8 multiple benchmark datasets,
including binary and multiclass datasets, demonstrate that the proposed model
achieves improved accuracy compared to standard RF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new framework for high-dimensional constrained black-box optimization using flow-based models and posterior inference to address scalability and mode collapse issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing high-dimensional functions under constraints is challenging due to hard-to-find feasible regions and limitations of existing methods like Bayesian optimization and generative models.

Method: Proposes a two-stage approach: (1) train flow-based models and surrogate models for uncertainty quantification, (2) cast candidate selection as posterior inference, amortizing sampling in latent space.

Result: Empirically shows superior performance on synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses scalability and mode collapse, offering a robust solution for constrained optimization.

Abstract: Optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions under black-box constraints
is a pervasive task in a wide range of scientific and engineering problems.
These problems are typically harder than unconstrained problems due to
hard-to-find feasible regions. While Bayesian optimization (BO) methods have
been developed to solve such problems, they often struggle with the curse of
dimensionality. Recently, generative model-based approaches have emerged as a
promising alternative for constrained optimization. However, they suffer from
poor scalability and are vulnerable to mode collapse, particularly when the
target distribution is highly multi-modal. In this paper, we propose a new
framework to overcome these challenges. Our method iterates through two stages.
First, we train flow-based models to capture the data distribution and
surrogate models that predict both function values and constraint violations
with uncertainty quantification. Second, we cast the candidate selection
problem as a posterior inference problem to effectively search for promising
candidates that have high objective values while not violating the constraints.
During posterior inference, we find that the posterior distribution is highly
multi-modal and has a large plateau due to constraints, especially when
constraint feedback is given as binary indicators of feasibility. To mitigate
this issue, we amortize the sampling from the posterior distribution in the
latent space of flow-based models, which is much smoother than that in the data
space. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance
on various synthetic and real-world constrained black-box optimization tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe RL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into unsafe actions, posing significant risks.

Method: Proposes PNAct, a framework using Positive and Negative Action samples to implant backdoors, with a designed attack algorithm.

Result: Experiments confirm the effectiveness of the backdoor attack, highlighting vulnerabilities in Safe RL.

Conclusion: The study underscores the risks of backdoor attacks in Safe RL and calls for attention to such threats.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is widely used in tasks where agents interact
with an environment to maximize rewards. Building on this foundation, Safe
Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) incorporates a cost metric alongside the
reward metric, ensuring that agents adhere to safety constraints during
decision-making. In this paper, we identify that Safe RL is vulnerable to
backdoor attacks, which can manipulate agents into performing unsafe actions.
First, we introduce the relevant concepts and evaluation metrics for backdoor
attacks in Safe RL. It is the first attack framework in the Safe RL field that
involves both Positive and Negative Action sample (PNAct) is to implant
backdoors, where positive action samples provide reference actions and negative
action samples indicate actions to be avoided. We theoretically point out the
properties of PNAct and design an attack algorithm. Finally, we conduct
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed backdoor attack
framework, evaluating it with the established metrics. This paper highlights
the potential risks associated with Safe RL and underscores the feasibility of
such attacks. Our code and supplementary material are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scalability issues of Boltzmann Exploration (B-exp) in large action sets by leveraging hyperspherical embeddings.

Method: Sample state embeddings using von Mises-Fisher distribution and explore nearest neighbors, enabling scalability to unlimited actions.

Result: vMF-exp matches B-exp's exploration probability asymptotically while being more scalable, validated in simulations, real-world data, and a music streaming service.

Conclusion: vMF-exp is a scalable and effective alternative to B-exp for large action sets with hyperspherical embeddings.

Abstract: This paper introduces von Mises-Fisher exploration (vMF-exp), a scalable
method for exploring large action sets in reinforcement learning problems where
hyperspherical embedding vectors represent these actions. vMF-exp involves
initially sampling a state embedding representation using a von Mises-Fisher
distribution, then exploring this representation's nearest neighbors, which
scales to virtually unlimited numbers of candidate actions. We show that, under
theoretical assumptions, vMF-exp asymptotically maintains the same probability
of exploring each action as Boltzmann Exploration (B-exp), a popular
alternative that, nonetheless, suffers from scalability issues as it requires
computing softmax values for each action. Consequently, vMF-exp serves as a
scalable alternative to B-exp for exploring large action sets with
hyperspherical embeddings. Experiments on simulated data, real-world public
data, and the successful large-scale deployment of vMF-exp on the recommender
system of a global music streaming service empirically validate the key
properties of the proposed method.

TL;DR: A novel generative pretraining strategy for EHR data using next-visit event prediction, addressing pitfalls in evaluation and demonstrating competitive performance for disease forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of large-scale pretraining in healthcare with structured EHR data.

Method: Autoregressive generative pretraining for sequential EHR data, with regularization for repeated events and zero-shot evaluation for disease forecasting.

Result: The model rivals a fine-tuned Transformer baseline in predicting dementia and knee osteoarthritis incidence without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures clinical dependencies and avoids inflated performance metrics, offering a cost-effective solution for EHR-based predictions.

Abstract: Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data
types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured
electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining
strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model
learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the
next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction
of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on
predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation
model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when
new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is
evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee
osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals
a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that
our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly
task-specific fine-tuning.

*Seok Bin Son,Joongheon Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QRL-NAS optimizes PQC structures in quantum reinforcement learning, outperforming fixed-circuit QRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the suboptimality of fixed PQC structures in QRL by introducing neural architecture search.

Method: Propose QRL-NAS, integrating quantum neural architecture search (QNAS) to optimize PQC structures.

Result: QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than fixed-circuit QRL, proving its effectiveness.

Conclusion: QRL-NAS enhances QRL performance by optimizing PQC structures, offering practical utility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies through
environmental interaction. However, RL suffers from reduced learning efficiency
due to the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional spaces. Quantum
reinforcement learning (QRL) addresses this issue by leveraging superposition
and entanglement in quantum computing, allowing efficient handling of
high-dimensional problems with fewer resources. QRL combines quantum neural
networks (QNNs) with RL, where the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) acts as
the core computational module. The PQC performs linear and nonlinear
transformations through gate operations, similar to hidden layers in classical
neural networks. Previous QRL studies, however, have used fixed PQC structures
based on empirical intuition without verifying their optimality. This paper
proposes a QRL-NAS algorithm that integrates quantum neural architecture search
(QNAS) to optimize PQC structures within QRL. Experiments demonstrate that
QRL-NAS achieves higher rewards than QRL with fixed circuits, validating its
effectiveness and practical utility.

### [231] [Residual Reward Models for Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00611)
*Chenyang Cao,Miguel Rogel-García,Mohamed Nabail,Xueqian Wang,Nicholas Rhinehart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Residual Reward Model (RRM) to improve Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) by combining prior knowledge with learned rewards, enhancing performance and convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PbRL avoids heuristic reward design but suffers from slow convergence due to reward model training challenges. Prior methods struggle with optimization when using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning.

Method: RRM splits the true reward into a prior reward (pre-defined or learned from IRL) and a learned reward (trained with preferences). State-based and image-based RRM versions are introduced and tested in Meta-World and on a real robot.

Result: RRM significantly improves PbRL performance, works with various prior rewards, and accelerates policy learning, achieving success in fewer steps than baselines. Real-world experiments on a Franka Panda robot confirm superior performance.

Conclusion: RRM effectively leverages prior knowledge to enhance PbRL, offering faster convergence and better performance across tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn
high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to
specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can
suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward
model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and
fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,
using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose
challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to
effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM
assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two
parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term
available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward
function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce
state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks
in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method
substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method
achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior
rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a
negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka
Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It
significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving
success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at

*André Ribeiro,Ana Luiza Tenório,Juan Belieni,Amauri H. Souza,Diego Mesquita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sheaf diffusion lacks cooperative behavior due to missing message directionality. The paper introduces directed cellular sheaves and CSNNs to address this, showing improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if sheaf diffusion can exhibit cooperative behavior and address its limitations in handling message directionality.

Method: Introduces cellular sheaves over directed graphs and proposes Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs).

Result: CSNNs outperform existing sheaf diffusion and cooperative GNN methods, mitigating oversquashing.

Conclusion: Directed cellular sheaves and CSNNs successfully enable cooperative behavior in sheaf diffusion, improving performance.

Abstract: Sheaf diffusion has recently emerged as a promising design pattern for graph
representation learning due to its inherent ability to handle heterophilic data
and avoid oversmoothing. Meanwhile, cooperative message passing has also been
proposed as a way to enhance the flexibility of information diffusion by
allowing nodes to independently choose whether to propagate/gather information
from/to neighbors. A natural question ensues: is sheaf diffusion capable of
exhibiting this cooperative behavior? Here, we provide a negative answer to
this question. In particular, we show that existing sheaf diffusion methods
fail to achieve cooperative behavior due to the lack of message directionality.
To circumvent this limitation, we introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over
directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We
leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Networks (CSNNs).
Theoretically, we characterize the receptive field of CSNN and show it allows
nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring
all others in their path, potentially mitigating oversquashing. Our experiments
show that CSNN presents overall better performance compared to prior art on
sheaf diffusion as well as cooperative graph neural networks.

*Maurizio Filippone,Marius P. Linhard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper interprets GANs as probabilistic generative models, linking them to Bayesian neural networks, and proposes regularization and optimization strategies for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of GAN optimization and overfitting by reinterpreting GANs as probabilistic models and leveraging Bayesian principles.

Method: Interprets GANs as Bayesian neural networks with partial stochasticity, optimizing a proxy for marginal likelihood and applying Occam's razor principles for regularization.

Result: Proposed strategies improve GAN performance and provide insights into regularization for better generalization.

Conclusion: The probabilistic interpretation and new strategies enhance GAN understanding and performance, offering a foundation for future regularization research.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are popular and successful generative
models. Despite their success, optimization is notoriously challenging and they
require regularization against overfitting. In this work, we explain the
success and limitations of GANs by interpreting them as probabilistic
generative models. This interpretation enables us to view GANs as Bayesian
neural networks with partial stochasticity, allowing us to establish conditions
of universal approximation. We can then cast the adversarial-style optimization
of several variants of GANs as the optimization of a proxy for the marginal
likelihood. Taking advantage of the connection between marginal likelihood
optimization and Occam's razor, we can define regularization and optimization
strategies to smooth the loss landscape and search for solutions with minimum
description length, which are associated with flat minima and good
generalization. The results on a wide range of experiments indicate that these
strategies lead to performance improvements and pave the way to a deeper
understanding of regularization strategies for GANs.

*Yilun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Cognitive Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, applying Cognitive Load Theory to optimize LLM inference, reducing token use by up to 45% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs of LLM inference by integrating cognitive theory into optimization, moving beyond heuristic-based methods.

Method: Develops CLAI framework with quantifiable metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$, $GCL_{LLM}$) and two implementations: CLAI-Prompt (zero-shot) and CLAI-Tune (fine-tuned).

Result: Achieves significant token reduction (up to 45%) in benchmarks while maintaining accuracy; CLAI-Tune shows emergent problem decomposition.

Conclusion: Emulating brain resource management improves LLM efficiency, robustness, and capability, offering a sustainable deployment path.

Abstract: The escalating computational costs of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
have become a critical barrier to their widespread and sustainable deployment.
While existing optimization strategies are effective, they are predominantly
based on statistical heuristics or architectural modifications, lacking a
guiding cognitive theory to manage the inference process itself. This paper
aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive
Load-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from
Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize
the concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and
Germane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,
and $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive
economics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem
($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically
allocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two
implementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM
through cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a
fine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive
economy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context
question answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant
reductions in token consumption (up to 45\%) without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose
difficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition. This work
demonstrates that by emulating the brain's resource management strategies, we
can build more efficient, robust, and capable artificial intelligence systems.

*Hans van Gorp,Davide Belli,Amir Jalalirad,Bence Major*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN) is proposed to integrate road network data with GNSS measurements, reducing positioning errors by 29% in dense urban areas compared to GNSS-only Kalman Filter methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS accuracy is compromised in dense urban environments due to multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Existing methods using road network data are either offline or rely on inflexible Kalman Filter heuristics.

Method: A TGNN is trained to predict the correct road segment and its uncertainty, integrating this into the Kalman Filter's measurement update step.

Result: Real-world validation shows a 29% reduction in positioning error for challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: This is the first deep learning-based approach combining road network data and GNSS measurements to improve positioning accuracy.

Abstract: The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides critical positioning
information globally, but its accuracy in dense urban environments is often
compromised by multipath and non-line-of-sight errors. Road network data can be
used to reduce the impact of these errors and enhance the accuracy of a
positioning system. Previous works employing road network data are either
limited to offline applications, or rely on Kalman Filter (KF) heuristics with
little flexibility and robustness. We instead propose training a Temporal Graph
Neural Network (TGNN) to integrate road network information into a KF. The TGNN
is designed to predict the correct road segment and its associated uncertainty
to be used in the measurement update step of the KF. We validate our approach
with real-world GNSS data and open-source road networks, observing a 29%
decrease in positioning error for challenging scenarios compared to a GNSS-only
KF. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first deep learning-based
approach jointly employing road network data and GNSS measurements to determine
the user position on Earth.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Audio-3DVG integrates audio and spatial info for 3D visual grounding, outperforming text-based methods by decomposing speech into object mention detection and audio-guided attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focuses on text, but spoken language (audio) is underexplored. Advances in ASR and speech representation learning enable this integration.

Method: Decomposes task into Object Mention Detection (multi-label classification) and Audio-Guided Attention (captures object-speech interactions). Uses synthesized audio from standard datasets.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art in audio-based grounding and competes with text-based methods.

Conclusion: Integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks shows promise, as demonstrated by Audio-3DVG's performance.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) involves localizing target objects in 3D point
clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

*Philipp Vaeth,Dibyanshu Kumar,Benjamin Paassen,Magda Gregorová*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends classifier guidance in diffusion processes to work with non-robust classifiers, addressing their instability under noisy conditions through denoising and stabilization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier guidance typically requires robust classifiers trained on diffusion noise, limiting its applicability. This work aims to broaden the use of general classifiers.

Method: The authors analyze noise sensitivity of classifiers, propose using one-step denoised predictions, and apply stabilization techniques like exponential moving averages.

Result: The method improves guidance stability while preserving sample diversity and visual quality, as validated on CelebA, SportBalls, and CelebA-HQ datasets.

Conclusion: This work advances conditional sampling in generative models by enabling the use of non-robust classifiers for guidance.

Abstract: Classifier guidance is intended to steer a diffusion process such that a
given classifier reliably recognizes the generated data point as a certain
class. However, most classifier guidance approaches are restricted to robust
classifiers, which were specifically trained on the noise of the diffusion
forward process. We extend classifier guidance to work with general,
non-robust, classifiers that were trained without noise. We analyze the
sensitivity of both non-robust and robust classifiers to noise of the diffusion
process on the standard CelebA data set, the specialized SportBalls data set
and the high-dimensional real-world CelebA-HQ data set. Our findings reveal
that non-robust classifiers exhibit significant accuracy degradation under
noisy conditions, leading to unstable guidance gradients. To mitigate these
issues, we propose a method that utilizes one-step denoised image predictions
and implements stabilization techniques inspired by stochastic optimization
methods, such as exponential moving averages. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves the stability of classifier guidance while
maintaining sample diversity and visual quality. This work contributes to
advancing conditional sampling techniques in generative models, enabling a
broader range of classifiers to be used as guidance classifiers.

### [238] [A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00695)
*Daniel Pfrommer,Max Simchowitz,Ali Jadbabaie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework linking RL-style value functions to incremental stability, distinct from traditional Lyapunov methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between RL value functions (non-smooth, unbounded) and control theory's Lyapunov stability certificates.

Method: Develops an equivalence between incremental input-to-state stability (δISS) and the regularity of RL-style value functions using Hölder-continuous rewards.

Result: Shows RL value functions' regularity connects to incremental stability, offering a non-Lyapunov stability certification approach.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel way to understand stability in RL, diverging from traditional control theory methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing
Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using
rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with
Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement
learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a
Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides.
Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov
certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental
input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the
regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a
H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity
of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be
understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based
approach to certifying stability in control theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCAWaveNet, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, improves significant wave height (SWH) retrieval by leveraging cross-channel information, outperforming existing models with reduced RMSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models for SWH retrieval from CYGNSS data lack effective cross-channel information interaction, limiting performance.

Method: SCAWaveNet models features from each channel as independent attention heads, fusing spatial and channel-wise information, and uses a lightweight attention mechanism for auxiliary parameters.

Result: SCAWaveNet achieves RMSE of 0.438 m (ERA5) and 0.432 m (NDBC), reducing RMSE by 3.52% and 5.47% respectively compared to state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: SCAWaveNet demonstrates superior performance in SWH retrieval by effectively utilizing cross-channel interactions, with publicly available code for further use.

Abstract: Recent advancements in spaceborne GNSS missions have produced extensive
global datasets, providing a robust basis for deep learning-based significant
wave height (SWH) retrieval. While existing deep learning models predominantly
utilize CYGNSS data with four-channel information, they often adopt
single-channel inputs or simple channel concatenation without leveraging the
benefits of cross-channel information interaction during training. To address
this limitation, a novel spatial-channel attention-based network, namely
SCAWaveNet, is proposed for SWH retrieval. Specifically, features from each
channel of the DDMs are modeled as independent attention heads, enabling the
fusion of spatial and channel-wise information. For auxiliary parameters, a
lightweight attention mechanism is designed to assign weights along the spatial
and channel dimensions. The final feature integrates both spatial and
channel-level characteristics. Model performance is evaluated using
four-channel CYGNSS data. When ERA5 is used as a reference, SCAWaveNet achieves
an average RMSE of 0.438 m. When using buoy data from NDBC, the average RMSE
reaches 0.432 m. Compared to state-of-the-art models, SCAWaveNet reduces the
average RMSE by at least 3.52% on the ERA5 dataset and by 5.47% on the NDBC
buoy observations. The code is available at

Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' benchmark improvements truly reflect enhanced reasoning or are undermined by overthinking and ineffective reasoning steps.

Method: Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024 math benchmark to analyze their reasoning behavior and ability to integrate corrective information.

Result: Models often generate longer, ineffective reasoning chains and disregard correct solutions, leading to incorrect conclusions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical limitations in LLMs' reasoning robustness and interpretability, posing challenges for future improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
recently achieved impressive results on reasoning benchmarks. Yet, growing
evidence shows that these models often generate longer but ineffective chains
of thought (CoTs), calling into question whether benchmark gains reflect real
reasoning improvements. We present new evidence of overthinking, where models
disregard correct solutions even when explicitly provided, instead continuing
to generate unnecessary reasoning steps that often lead to incorrect
conclusions. Experiments on three state-of-the-art models using the AIME2024
math benchmark reveal critical limitations in these models ability to integrate
corrective information, posing new challenges for achieving robust and

*Stefan Haas,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces new measures for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal classification, outperforming existing methods in error and OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ordinal classification is common in critical fields, but existing uncertainty measures focus on nominal classification and regression, leaving a gap for ordinal problems.

Method: The authors propose entropy- and variance-based measures for ordinal classification by reducing them to binary cases, tested with gradient-boosted trees and MLPs.

Result: The new measures outperform standard methods in error detection (misclassification rates, MAE) and show competitive OOD detection performance.

Conclusion: The ordinal nature of problems must be considered for accurate uncertainty assessment, as demonstrated by the proposed measures.

Abstract: Ordinal classification problems, where labels exhibit a natural order, are
prevalent in high-stakes fields such as medicine and finance. Accurate
uncertainty quantification, including the decomposition into aleatoric
(inherent variability) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) components, is crucial
for reliable decision-making. However, existing research has primarily focused
on nominal classification and regression. In this paper, we introduce a novel
class of measures of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in ordinal
classification, which is based on a suitable reduction to (entropy- and
variance-based) measures for the binary case. These measures effectively
capture the trade-off in ordinal classification between exact hit-rate and
minimial error distances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
various tabular ordinal benchmark datasets using ensembles of gradient-boosted
trees and multi-layer perceptrons for approximate Bayesian inference. Our
method significantly outperforms standard and label-wise entropy and
variance-based measures in error detection, as indicated by misclassification
rates and mean absolute error. Additionally, the ordinal measures show
competitive performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering the ordinal nature of classification
problems when assessing uncertainty.

*Arthur Thuy,Ekaterina Loginova,Dries F. Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks QDE methods, introduces OrderedLogitNN for ordinal regression, and proposes balanced DRPS for fair evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing neglect of ordinal nature in QDE and biased evaluation metrics.

Method: Benchmarks discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression; introduces OrderedLogitNN and balanced DRPS.

Result: OrderedLogitNN outperforms on complex tasks; balanced DRPS proves robust.

Conclusion: Balanced DRPS and OrderedLogitNN provide a principled foundation for future QDE research.

Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates 27 open-source and 2 proprietary LLMs for identifying faulty components from ambiguous user reports, achieving an F1-score up to 0.76. Three models (mistral-small-24b-instruct, llama-3.2-1b-instruct, gemma-2-2b-it) balance performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating fault identification from ambiguous user reports is challenging but crucial for improving user experience and testing.

Method: Evaluated 27 open-source and 2 proprietary LLMs using four prompting strategies (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, CoT+Few-Shot) across 98,948 inferences.

Result: Achieved F1-score up to 0.76; identified three models with optimal performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Smaller models like llama-3.2-1b-instruct and gemma-2-2b-it offer competitive performance with lower resource usage, making them suitable for end-user devices.

Abstract: Computer manufacturers offer platforms for users to describe device faults
using textual reports such as "My screen is flickering". Identifying the faulty
component from the report is essential for automating tests and improving user
experience. However, such reports are often ambiguous and lack detail, making
this task challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in
addressing such issues. This study evaluates 27 open-source models (1B-72B
parameters) and 2 proprietary LLMs using four prompting strategies: Zero-Shot,
Few-Shot, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and CoT+Few-Shot (CoT+FS). We conducted
98,948 inferences, processing over 51 million input tokens and generating 13

*Wenbo Yu,Anirbit Ghosh,Tobias Sebastian Finn,Rossella Arcucci,Marc Bocquet,Sibo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A denoising diffusion model is introduced to predict wildfire spread, generating multiple possible scenarios to account for uncertainty, unlike traditional deterministic models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfire spread prediction is challenging due to its unpredictable nature and dependence on diverse environmental conditions. Traditional models often fail to represent uncertainty.

Method: The study employs a denoising diffusion model, an AI framework that simulates wildfire spread as a range of possible outcomes rather than a single prediction.

Result: The model produces ensembles of forecasts reflecting physically meaningful distributions of fire spread, improving reliability and accuracy.

Conclusion: This technology enhances wildfire behavior prediction, aiding decision-makers in risk assessment and response planning.

Abstract: Thanks to recent advances in generative AI, computers can now simulate
realistic and complex natural processes. We apply this capability to predict
how wildfires spread, a task made difficult by the unpredictable nature of fire
and the variety of environmental conditions it depends on. In this study, We
present the first denoising diffusion model for predicting wildfire spread, a
new kind of AI framework that learns to simulate fires not just as one fixed
outcome, but as a range of possible scenarios. By doing so, it accounts for the
inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics, a feature that traditional models
typically fail to represent. Unlike deterministic approaches that generate a
single prediction, our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect
physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. This
technology could help us develop smarter, faster, and more reliable tools for
anticipating wildfire behavior, aiding decision-makers in fire risk assessment
and response planning.

TL;DR: The paper explores using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to enhance Reinforcement Learning (RL) performance in industrial sorting tasks by generating expert demonstrations for RL agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL's broader deployment is limited by sample inefficiency and unstable learning dynamics; GAs are proposed to address these challenges.

Method: GA-generated expert demonstrations are integrated into DQN replay buffers and used as warm-start trajectories for PPO agents.

Result: GA-derived demonstrations significantly improved RL performance, with PPO agents achieving superior cumulative rewards.

Conclusion: Hybrid learning paradigms combining heuristic search (GAs) and data-driven RL show promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in certain
real-world industrial applications, yet its broader deployment remains limited
by inherent challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable learning
dynamics. This study investigates the utilization of Genetic Algorithms (GAs)
as a mechanism for improving RL performance in an industrially inspired sorting
environment. We propose a novel approach in which GA-generated expert
demonstrations are used to enhance policy learning. These demonstrations are
incorporated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) replay buffer for experience-based
learning and utilized as warm-start trajectories for Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agents to accelerate training convergence. Our experiments
compare standard RL training with rule-based heuristics, brute-force
optimization, and demonstration data, revealing that GA-derived demonstrations
significantly improve RL performance. Notably, PPO agents initialized with
GA-generated data achieved superior cumulative rewards, highlighting the
potential of hybrid learning paradigms, where heuristic search methods
complement data-driven RL. The utilized framework is publicly available and
enables further research into adaptive RL strategies for real-world
applications.

*Rishal Aggrwal,Jacky Chen,Nicholas M. Boffi,David Ryan Koes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to efficiently sample from the Boltzmann distribution by learning likelihoods via energy-based models, avoiding costly Jacobian computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling from the Boltzmann distribution is computationally expensive due to Jacobian calculations, especially for large molecular systems.

Method: Uses Continuous Normalizing Flows and energy-based models trained with noise contrastive estimation and score matching, combined with stochastic interpolants for annealing.

Result: Demonstrates comparable free energy profiles and distributions to exact likelihood methods, with significant speedup in estimating free energy differences.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently approximates the Boltzmann distribution, offering a practical solution for large molecular systems.

Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy
function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules.
Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows
that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to
match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining
likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it
impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning
the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained
with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic
interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we
combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function.
On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free
energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with
exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between
metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.

TL;DR: Quantum-accelerated machine learning outperforms classical methods in HIV cluster detection and forecasting, identifying key social determinants of health (SDoH) like housing instability as drivers of HIV transmission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of HIV epidemiological data necessitates advanced computational methods for accurate analysis and forecasting to improve surveillance and intervention strategies.

Method: The study used quantum-accelerated machine learning, including QAOA for cluster detection, a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for forecasting, and quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence.

Result: QAOA achieved 92% accuracy in cluster detection, the hybrid neural network predicted HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, and quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV clusters.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced methods offer superior precision and efficiency in HIV surveillance, enabling targeted interventions and addressing structural inequities in HIV transmission.

Abstract: HIV epidemiological data is increasingly complex, requiring advanced
computation for accurate cluster detection and forecasting. We employed
quantum-accelerated machine learning to analyze HIV prevalence at the ZIP-code
level using AIDSVu and synthetic SDoH data for 2022. Our approach compared
classical clustering (DBSCAN, HDBSCAN) with a quantum approximate optimization
algorithm (QAOA), developed a hybrid quantum-classical neural network for HIV
prevalence forecasting, and used quantum Bayesian networks to explore causal
links between SDoH factors and HIV incidence. The QAOA-based method achieved
92% accuracy in cluster detection within 1.6 seconds, outperforming classical
algorithms. Meanwhile, the hybrid quantum-classical neural network predicted
HIV prevalence with 94% accuracy, surpassing a purely classical counterpart.
Quantum Bayesian analysis identified housing instability as a key driver of HIV
cluster emergence and expansion, with stigma exerting a geographically variable
influence. These quantum-enhanced methods deliver greater precision and
efficiency in HIV surveillance while illuminating critical causal pathways.
This work can guide targeted interventions, optimize resource allocation for
PrEP, and address structural inequities fueling HIV transmission.

*Rares Cristian,Pavithra Harsha,Georgia Perakis,Brian Quanz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an end-to-end method for training ML models to account for downstream decision-making under endogenous uncertainty, including a robust optimization variant and a new class of two-stage stochastic problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of biased observations and lack of counterfactual information in decision-making, particularly in settings like pricing and inventory assortment.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end ML training method with robust optimization and introduces a two-stage stochastic optimization framework for information gathering and decision-making.

Result: Demonstrates improved performance over existing methods in computational experiments for pricing and inventory problems.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles endogenous uncertainty and improves decision-making by integrating ML predictions with robust and two-stage optimization.

Abstract: Many of the observations we make are biased by our decisions. For instance,
the demand of items is impacted by the prices set, and online checkout choices
are influenced by the assortments presented. The challenge in decision-making
under this setting is the lack of counterfactual information, and the need to
learn it instead. We introduce an end-to-end method under endogenous
uncertainty to train ML models to be aware of their downstream, enabling their
effective use in the decision-making stage. We further introduce a robust
optimization variant that accounts for uncertainty in ML models -- specifically
by constructing uncertainty sets over the space of ML models and optimizing
actions to protect against worst-case predictions. We prove guarantees that
this robust approach can capture near-optimal decisions with high probability
as a function of data. Besides this, we also introduce a new class of two-stage
stochastic optimization problems to the end-to-end learning framework that can
now be addressed through our framework. Here, the first stage is an
information-gathering problem to decide which random variable to poll and gain
information about before making a second-stage decision based off of it. We
present several computational experiments for pricing and inventory
assortment/recommendation problems. We compare against existing methods in
online learning/bandits/offline reinforcement learning and show our approach
has consistent improved performance over these. Just as in the endogenous
setting, the model's prediction also depends on the first-stage decision made.
While this decision does not affect the random variable in this setting, it
does affect the correct point forecast that should be made.

*Davide Andreoletti,Aris Marcolongo,Natasa Sarafijanovic Djukic,Julien Roulet,Stefano Billeter,Andrzej Kurenda,Margot Visse-Mansiaux,Brice Dupuis,Carrol Annette Plummer,Beatrice Paoli,Omran Ayoub*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning-based method predicts potato sprouting early using electrophysiological signals, improving storage management and reducing reliance on costly anti-sprouting chemicals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ban on CIPC and the limitations of visual sprouting detection necessitate an early prediction method to optimize storage and minimize waste.

Method: The approach uses electrophysiological signals, wavelet feature extraction, supervised ML models, and uncertainty quantification for early sprouting detection.

Result: The method accurately predicts sprouting days for some potatoes and shows acceptable average error, though further refinements are needed.

Conclusion: The proposed ML-based approach is promising for early sprouting prediction but requires improvements to reduce prediction errors.

Abstract: Accurately predicting potato sprouting before the emergence of any visual
signs is critical for effective storage management, as sprouting degrades both
the commercial and nutritional value of tubers. Effective forecasting allows
for the precise application of anti-sprouting chemicals (ASCs), minimizing
waste and reducing costs. This need has become even more pressing following the
ban on Isopropyl N-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC) or Chlorpropham due to
health and environmental concerns, which has led to the adoption of
significantly more expensive alternative ASCs. Existing approaches primarily
rely on visual identification, which only detects sprouting after morphological
changes have occurred, limiting their effectiveness for proactive management. A
reliable early prediction method is therefore essential to enable timely
intervention and improve the efficiency of post-harvest storage strategies,
where early refers to detecting sprouting before any visible signs appear. In
this work, we address the problem of early prediction of potato sprouting. To
this end, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach that enables
early prediction of potato sprouting using electrophysiological signals
recorded from tubers using proprietary sensors. Our approach preprocesses the
recorded signals, extracts relevant features from the wavelet domain, and
trains supervised ML models for early sprouting detection. Additionally, we
incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques to enhance predictions.
Experimental results demonstrate promising performance in the early detection
of potato sprouting by accurately predicting the exact day of sprouting for a
subset of potatoes and while showing acceptable average error across all
potatoes. Despite promising results, further refinements are necessary to
minimize prediction errors, particularly in reducing the maximum observed
deviations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel neural predictor combining GNNs and transformers is proposed to address their individual shortcomings, leveraging sibling nodes for improved accuracy and latency prediction in neural architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning's growth requires efficient network design, but existing methods (GNNs and transformers) have limitations in representing complex features and generalizing with depth.

Method: The approach introduces a token mixer for sibling nodes and a bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network, combining GNN and transformer strengths.

Result: The method achieves strong performance in accuracy and latency prediction, offering insights for DAG topology learning.

Conclusion: The proposed predictor effectively mitigates GNN and transformer weaknesses, demonstrating promising results for neural architecture tasks.

Abstract: The growing use of deep learning necessitates efficient network design and
deployment, making neural predictors vital for estimating attributes such as
accuracy and latency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers
have shown promising performance in representing neural architectures. However,
each of both methods has its disadvantages. GNNs lack the capabilities to
represent complicated features, while transformers face poor generalization
when the depth of architecture grows. To mitigate the above issues, we rethink
neural architecture topology and show that sibling nodes are pivotal while
overlooked in previous research. We thus propose a novel predictor leveraging
the strengths of GNNs and transformers to learn the enhanced topology. We
introduce a novel token mixer that considers siblings, and a new channel mixer
named bidirectional graph isomorphism feed-forward network. Our approach
consistently achieves promising performance in both accuracy and latency
prediction, providing valuable insights for learning Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) topology. The code is available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/NNFormer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TABASCO introduces a non-equivariant transformer for 3D molecular generation, simplifying architecture and improving speed and validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with physical plausibility despite strong inductive biases. TABASCO aims to relax these assumptions for better performance.

Method: Uses a standard non-equivariant transformer, treats atoms as sequences, and reconstructs bonds deterministically.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art validity on GEOM-Drugs, 10x faster inference, and emergent rotational equivariance.

Conclusion: TABASCO offers a minimalist, high-throughput approach for specialized tasks like drug design.

Abstract: State-of-the-art models for 3D molecular generation are based on significant
inductive biases, SE(3), permutation equivariance to respect symmetry and graph
message-passing networks to capture local chemistry, yet the generated
molecules still struggle with physical plausibility. We introduce TABASCO which
relaxes these assumptions: The model has a standard non-equivariant transformer
architecture, treats atoms in a molecule as sequences and reconstructs bonds
deterministically after generation. The absence of equivariant layers and
message passing allows us to significantly simplify the model architecture and
scale data throughput. On the GEOM-Drugs benchmark TABASCO achieves
state-of-the-art PoseBusters validity and delivers inference roughly 10x faster
than the strongest baseline, while exhibiting emergent rotational equivariance
despite symmetry not being hard-coded. Our work offers a blueprint for training
minimalist, high-throughput generative models suited to specialised tasks such
as structure- and pharmacophore-based drug design. We provide a link to our
implementation at github.com/carlosinator/tabasco.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) for federated learning (FL) to address privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity, ensuring differential privacy and minimal quantization error while improving learning utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces challenges like privacy risks from unprotected model updates and reduced utility due to quantization heterogeneity. Existing solutions often tackle only one issue, prompting the need for a unified approach.

Method: Introduces a stochastic quantizer (SQ) for differential privacy and minimal quantization error, alongside a cluster size optimization and linear fusion technique for model aggregation.

Result: Numerical simulations show improved privacy protection and learning utility compared to the LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

Conclusion: The proposed SQ and optimization techniques effectively enhance FL performance by balancing privacy and utility in heterogeneous quantization settings.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed
machine learning, enabling collaborative training of a global model across
multiple local devices without requiring them to share raw data. Despite its
advancements, FL is limited by factors such as: (i) privacy risks arising from
the unprotected transmission of local model updates to the fusion center (FC)
and (ii) decreased learning utility caused by heterogeneity in model
quantization resolution across participating devices. Prior work typically
addresses only one of these challenges because maintaining learning utility
under both privacy risks and quantization heterogeneity is a non-trivial task.
In this paper, our aim is therefore to improve the learning utility of a
privacy-preserving FL that allows clusters of devices with different
quantization resolutions to participate in each FL round. Specifically, we
introduce a novel stochastic quantizer (SQ) that is designed to simultaneously
achieve differential privacy (DP) and minimum quantization error. Notably, the
proposed SQ guarantees bounded distortion, unlike other DP approaches. To
address quantization heterogeneity, we introduce a cluster size optimization
technique combined with a linear fusion approach to enhance model aggregation
accuracy. Numerical simulations validate the benefits of our approach in terms
of privacy protection and learning utility compared to the conventional
LaplaceSQ-FL algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current understanding of MPNNs' generalization in node- and link-level tasks is limited, with existing studies often relying on unrealistic assumptions.

Method: A unified framework is proposed to analyze MPNN generalization, incorporating diverse architectural parameters, loss functions, and graph structure influence.

Result: The framework provides theoretical insights and empirical validation, improving understanding of MPNNs' generalization in inductive and transductive settings.

Conclusion: The work advances the understanding of MPNN generalization and offers a framework applicable beyond graph tasks.

Abstract: Using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) for node and link
prediction is crucial in various scientific and industrial domains, which has
led to the development of diverse MPNN architectures. Besides working well in
practical settings, their ability to generalize beyond the training set remains
poorly understood. While some studies have explored MPNNs' generalization in
graph-level prediction tasks, much less attention has been given to node- and
link-level predictions. Existing works often rely on unrealistic i.i.d.\@
assumptions, overlooking possible correlations between nodes or links, and
assuming fixed aggregation and impractical loss functions while neglecting the
influence of graph structure. In this work, we introduce a unified framework to
analyze the generalization properties of MPNNs in inductive and transductive
node and link prediction settings, incorporating diverse architectural
parameters and loss functions and quantifying the influence of graph structure.
Additionally, our proposed generalization framework can be applied beyond
graphs to any classification task under the inductive or transductive setting.
Our empirical study supports our theoretical insights, deepening our
understanding of MPNNs' generalization capabilities in these tasks.

TL;DR: SEPAL is a scalable embedding propagation algorithm for large knowledge graphs, designed to improve downstream task performance by optimizing embeddings on a core subset and propagating them globally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embedding methods for knowledge graphs are limited by their focus on link prediction and scalability issues with large graphs.

Method: SEPAL optimizes embeddings on a small core of entities and propagates them globally via message passing, ensuring scalability and quality.

Result: SEPAL outperforms previous methods on 46 downstream tasks and scales efficiently to large graphs on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: SEPAL addresses scalability and downstream task performance issues in knowledge graph embeddings, offering a practical solution for large-scale applications.

Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can benefit from external knowledge. Large
knowledge graphs store such knowledge, and embedding methods can be used to
distill it into ready-to-use vector representations for downstream
applications. For this purpose, current models have however two limitations:
they are primarily optimized for link prediction, via local contrastive
learning, and they struggle to scale to the largest graphs due to GPU memory
limits. To address these, we introduce SEPAL: a Scalable Embedding Propagation
ALgorithm for large knowledge graphs designed to produce high-quality
embeddings for downstream tasks at scale. The key idea of SEPAL is to enforce
global embedding alignment by optimizing embeddings only on a small core of
entities, and then propagating them to the rest of the graph via message
passing. We evaluate SEPAL on 7 large-scale knowledge graphs and 46 downstream
machine learning tasks. Our results show that SEPAL significantly outperforms
previous methods on downstream tasks. In addition, SEPAL scales up its base
embedding model, enabling fitting huge knowledge graphs on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: TARS is a reinforcement learning method to train LLMs for safety by adaptively allocating compute, improving robustness against harmful prompts and attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LLM safety by leveraging adaptive reasoning methods, addressing vulnerabilities and balancing safety with task completion.

Method: Uses RL with chain-of-thought traces, a warmstart SFT stage, mixed prompts, and a reward function to prevent reasoning degeneration.

Result: TARS-trained models show adaptive compute use, better safety-refusal trade-offs, and robustness to attacks like GCG and PAIR.

Conclusion: TARS provides an effective, open recipe for training LLMs to handle harmful requests through adaptive reasoning.

Abstract: Reasoning methods that adaptively allocate test-time compute have advanced
LLM performance on easy to verify domains such as math and code. In this work,
we study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of
robustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide
benefits. We build a recipe called $\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners
for Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to
reason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that
balances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical
design choices: (1) a "lightweight" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,
harmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many
refusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning
capabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive
behaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better
safety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish
between safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box
(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an
effective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful
requests by reasoning per prompt.

TL;DR: A unified framework for accelerating deep neural network training via stochastic gradient descent by analyzing the geometric landscape and introducing a Lyapunov exponent diagnostic. A ghost category extension is proposed to improve early-stage trainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and accelerate the training of deep neural networks by distinguishing genuine convergence from stabilization near saddle points.

Method: Analyze the objective function's geometric landscape, introduce a Lyapunov exponent diagnostic, and extend classifiers with ghost output nodes for extra descent directions.

Result: The ghost extension reduces approximation error, collapses after convergence, and preserves asymptotic behavior while accelerating early training.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled architecture-level intervention for faster early-stage training without compromising asymptotic performance.

Abstract: Recent studies have proposed interpreting the training process from an
ergodic perspective. Building on this foundation we present a unified framework
for understanding and accelerating the training of deep neural networks via
stochastic gradient descent. By analyzing the geometric landscape of the
objective function we introduce a practical diagnostic, the running estimate of
the largest Lyapunov exponent, which provably distinguishes genuine convergence
toward stable minimizers from mere statistical stabilization near saddle
points. We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers
that adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent
directions that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable
the optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show
that this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after
sufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's
invariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in
the enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while
the original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin. Taken together these
results provide a principled architecture level intervention that accelerates
early stage trainability while preserving asymptotic behavior.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeCO introduces a Zero Communication Overhead sequence parallelism method for linear attention models, achieving near-linear scalability for long sequences by minimizing communication overhead with All-Scan.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Sequence Parallelism methods for linear attention models suffer from high communication overhead, limiting efficiency for ultra-long sequences.

Method: ZeCO uses All-Scan, a new collective communication primitive, to eliminate communication overhead and distribute workloads efficiently.

Result: ZeCO achieves a 60% speedup on 256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length compared to SOTA methods, matching single-device performance for shorter sequences.

Conclusion: ZeCO enables efficient training of next-generation LLMs on previously intractable sequence lengths.

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language
Models (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient
processing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing
Sequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads
across devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication
overhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)
sequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to
overcome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for
long sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length
across 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an
16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new
collective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with
precisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal
communication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.
Theoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only
negligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication
costs of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that
All-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on
256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\% speedup compared to
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a

### [260] [MVGBench: Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-view Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00006)
*Xianghui Xie,Chuhang Zou,Meher Gitika Karumuri,Jan Eric Lenssen,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: MVGBench is a benchmark for multi-view image generation models, evaluating 3D consistency, image quality, and semantics without relying on ground truth. It introduces a 3D self-consistency metric and tests 12 MVGs on real and synthetic datasets, leading to the proposal of ViFiGen, a superior method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for MVGs rely on ground truth comparisons, which are unsuitable for generative tasks with multiple valid solutions. Robustness and generalization of MVGs are also under-evaluated.

Method: MVGBench introduces a 3D self-consistency metric and evaluates MVGs on four datasets, assessing performance, generalization, and robustness.

Result: The benchmark identifies limitations in existing MVGs, particularly in robustness and generalization, and highlights critical design choices. ViFiGen, proposed based on these findings, outperforms other MVGs in 3D consistency.

Conclusion: MVGBench provides a rigorous evaluation framework for MVGs, revealing key insights and leading to the development of ViFiGen, which sets a new standard for 3D consistency.

Abstract: We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image
generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture,
image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs
have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing
metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is
not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while
differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on
different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to
these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly.
Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices
contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects:
best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of
comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric
which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We
systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and
synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of
existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we
find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we
propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D
consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.

TL;DR: FreNBRDF introduces a frequency-rectified neural BRDF model using spherical harmonics, improving material appearance reconstruction and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BRDF models lack frequency-domain understanding, limiting realism in neural material representations.

Method: Uses spherical harmonics and a novel frequency-rectified loss for neural BRDF modeling, integrated into a reconstruction and editing pipeline.

Result: FreNBRDF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and adaptability for material appearance tasks.

Conclusion: FreNBRDF enhances fidelity and interpretability in material modeling, enabling better downstream applications.

Abstract: Accurate material modeling is crucial for achieving photorealistic rendering,
bridging the gap between computer-generated imagery and real-world photographs.
While traditional approaches rely on tabulated BRDF data, recent work has
shifted towards implicit neural representations, which offer compact and
flexible frameworks for a range of tasks. However, their behavior in the
frequency domain remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce
FreNBRDF, a frequency-rectified neural material representation. By leveraging
spherical harmonics, we integrate frequency-domain considerations into neural
BRDF modeling. We propose a novel frequency-rectified loss, derived from a
frequency analysis of neural materials, and incorporate it into a generalizable
and adaptive reconstruction and editing pipeline. This framework enhances
fidelity, adaptability, and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\ours improves the accuracy and robustness of material appearance
reconstruction and editing compared to state-of-the-art baselines, enabling
more structured and interpretable downstream tasks and applications.

*Chanseok Lee,Fakhriyya Mammadova,Jiseong Barg,Mooseok Jang*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: A physics-aware style transfer method is proposed for inline holographic imaging, enabling complex amplitude reconstruction without high-quality ground truth datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning methods require high-quality ground truth datasets for complex amplitude reconstruction, which are often difficult to obtain.

Method: Uses style transfer to interpret object-to-sensor distance as an implicit style, enabling adaptive learning with intensity-only datasets.

Result: Demonstrated successful reconstruction of red blood cell morphology, showcasing real-time, label-free imaging potential.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical learning strategy for imaging applications lacking ground truth data, leveraging inherent physical cues.

Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of
reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns.
Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical
phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth
datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping
operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style
transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit
style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate
domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping
operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of
intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by
reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells,
highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework
that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented
method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where
ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.

TL;DR: The paper explores using machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models to predict molecular geometries, bypassing expensive DFT methods. It trains foundation models on a large relaxation dataset and demonstrates their utility for geometry optimization and property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like DFT for obtaining 3D molecular geometries are costly. The study aims to leverage MLIP models to provide accurate geometries more efficiently.

Method: A large-scale dataset of 3.5 million molecules and 300 million snapshots is curated. MLIP foundation models are trained with supervised learning to predict energy and forces. These models are then used for geometry optimization and fine-tuning for property prediction.

Result: The MLIP foundation models successfully provide low-energy 3D geometries and enhance downstream property predictions, showing comparable accuracy to traditional methods.

Conclusion: MLIP models trained on relaxation data offer a viable and efficient alternative to DFT for obtaining molecular geometries, benefiting property predictions.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property predictions require 3D geometries, which are
typically obtained using expensive methods such as density functional theory
(DFT). Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on
machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first
curate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million
molecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained
with supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular
structures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in
different ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it
can be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization,
providing relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions.
To mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce
geometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation
models can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D
geometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models
trained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that
benefit property predictions.

Motivation: Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and computational demands of EM simulations in nanophotonics. ML offers a solution to these bottlenecks.

Method: ML-enhanced inverse design is categorized into output-side (learning solution-space representations for differentiable solvers) and input-side (learning latent-space representations for generative models) approaches. Hybrid frameworks combine physics-based optimization with data-driven methods.

Result: ML methods accelerate optimization, enable efficient global exploration, and improve scalability. Hybrid frameworks help escape local optima and facilitate knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: Open challenges include managing complexity, geometry-independent representations, integrating fabrication constraints, and advancing multiphysics co-designs.

Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures
achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for
recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization
methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces
and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine
learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review
frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of
representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and
input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in
the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates
optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact,
latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient
global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique
trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design
discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization
with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve
scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting
open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management,
geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints,
and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.

Motivation: To expand the capabilities of CvHNNs by introducing phase and magnitude quantization, increasing the number of states and broadening applications.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the stability-resolution dilemma in continuous attractor networks (CANs) by proposing sparse binary distributed codes with grid-cell-like features, enabling high stability and resolution simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the sensitivity of CANs to imperfections like noise and heterogeneity, which compromises their ability to retain continuous variables robustly.

Method: Investigates sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature embeddings with spatially-periodic receptive fields, akin to grid cells. Theoretical analysis and simulations validate the approach.

Result: The proposed grid-cell-like codes allow CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution, extending to nonlinear manifolds and programmable vector fields.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical framework for robust high-resolution representation of continuous variables in the brain, enabling flexible computations on task-relevant manifolds.

Abstract: Continuous attractor networks (CANs) are widely used to model how the brain
temporarily retains continuous behavioural variables via persistent recurrent
activity, such as an animal's position in an environment. However, this memory
mechanism is very sensitive to even small imperfections, such as noise or
heterogeneity, which are both common in biological systems. Previous work has
shown that discretising the continuum into a finite set of discrete attractor
states provides robustness to these imperfections, but necessarily reduces the
resolution of the represented variable, creating a dilemma between stability
and resolution. We show that this stability-resolution dilemma is most severe
for CANs using unimodal bump-like codes, as in traditional models. To overcome
this, we investigate sparse binary distributed codes based on random feature
embeddings, in which neurons have spatially-periodic receptive fields. We
demonstrate theoretically and with simulations that such grid-cell-like codes
enable CANs to achieve both high stability and high resolution simultaneously.
The model extends to embedding arbitrary nonlinear manifolds into a CAN, such
as spheres or tori, and generalises linear path integration to integration
along freely-programmable on-manifold vector fields. Together, this work
provides a theory of how the brain could robustly represent continuous
variables with high resolution and perform flexible computations over
task-relevant manifolds.

TL;DR: MassTool is a multi-task framework for improving tool retrieval in LLMs by enhancing query representation and retrieval accuracy using a two-tower architecture and adaptive learning modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches focus on tool representations but neglect precise query comprehension, limiting retrieval accuracy.

Method: MassTool uses a two-tower architecture (tool usage detection and retrieval), QC-GCN for query-tool matching, SUIM for intent modeling, and AdaKT for multi-task learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show MassTool improves retrieval accuracy.

Conclusion: MassTool effectively addresses the gap in query comprehension and enhances tool retrieval for LLMs.

Abstract: Tool retrieval is a critical component in enabling large language models
(LLMs) to interact effectively with external tools. It aims to precisely filter
the massive tools into a small set of candidates for the downstream
tool-augmented LLMs. However, most existing approaches primarily focus on
optimizing tool representations, often neglecting the importance of precise
query comprehension. To address this gap, we introduce MassTool, a multi-task
search-based framework designed to enhance both query representation and tool
retrieval accuracy. MassTool employs a two-tower architecture: a tool usage
detection tower that predicts the need for function calls, and a tool retrieval
tower that leverages a query-centric graph convolution network (QC-GCN) for
effective query-tool matching. It also incorporates search-based user intent
modeling (SUIM) to handle diverse and out-of-distribution queries, alongside an
adaptive knowledge transfer (AdaKT) module for efficient multi-task learning.
By jointly optimizing tool usage detection loss, list-wise retrieval loss, and
contrastive regularization loss, MassTool establishes a robust dual-step
sequential decision-making pipeline for precise query understanding. Extensive
experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/wxydada/MassTool.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the lack of real-world adoption of group recommender systems despite extensive research, suggesting a shift toward AI-assisted, interactive designs like ChatGPT for more natural decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite decades of research, group recommender systems are rarely used in practice, prompting a reexamination of assumptions and system designs.

Method: Proposes leveraging modern Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to create interactive, agentic group recommendation systems where AI assists human group discussions.

Result: Highlights the gap between academic research and practical needs, advocating for AI-driven, chat-based solutions.

Conclusion: Calls for a reorientation in group recommender research to focus on AI-assisted, interactive systems for broader real-world adoption.

Abstract: More than twenty-five years ago, first ideas were developed on how to design
a system that can provide recommendations to groups of users instead of
individual users. Since then, a rich variety of algorithmic proposals were
published, e.g., on how to acquire individual preferences, how to aggregate
them, and how to generate recommendations for groups of users. However, despite
the rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group
recommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in
academic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group
and how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue
that these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not
match the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in
this research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI
assistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we
envision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members
interact in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the
decision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a
more natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of
group recommendation systems in practice.

Result: Evaluation of ten state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv reveals performance differences and validates the effectiveness of the dynamic reflection strategy.

Conclusion: WebArXiv provides a reliable benchmark for web agents, and the proposed reflection mechanism addresses a common failure mode, improving agent decision-making.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the development
of autonomous web agents capable of navigating and interacting with real
websites. However, evaluating such agents remains challenging due to the
instability and inconsistency of existing benchmarks, which often rely on
dynamic content or oversimplified simulations. In this work, we introduce
WebArXiv, a static and time-invariant benchmark comprising 275 web-based tasks
grounded in the arXiv platform. WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable
evaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground
truths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we
identify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents
over-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a
lightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively
retrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten
state-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance
differences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of computing data-aware optimal alignments for declarative process models with general data types and conditions, combining A* search and SMT solving for efficiency and expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment-based conformance checking for declarative models lacks support for rich data dependencies, limiting practical applicability.

Method: A novel algorithmic technique combining A* search and SMT solving, using repair actions to resolve constraint violations incrementally.

Result: The approach efficiently computes optimal alignments, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art performance while supporting more expressive data dependencies.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates potential for real-world applications by balancing efficiency and expressiveness in data-aware conformance checking.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in process analysis and mining for data-aware
specifications, alignment-based conformance checking for declarative process
models has focused on pure control-flow specifications, or mild data-aware
extensions limited to numerical data and variable-to-constant comparisons. This
is not surprising: finding alignments is computationally hard, even more so in
the presence of data dependencies. In this paper, we challenge this problem in
the case where the reference model is captured using data-aware Declare with
general data types and data conditions. We show that, unexpectedly, it is
possible to compute data-aware optimal alignments in this rich setting,
enjoying at once efficiency and expressiveness. This is achieved by carefully
combining the two best-known approaches to deal with control flow and data
dependencies when computing alignments, namely A* search and SMT solving.
Specifically, we introduce a novel algorithmic technique that efficiently
explores the search space, generating descendant states through the application
of repair actions aiming at incrementally resolving constraint violations. We
prove the correctness of our algorithm and experimentally show its efficiency.
The evaluation witnesses that our approach matches or surpasses the performance
of the state of the art while also supporting significantly more expressive
data dependencies, showcasing its potential to support real-world applications.

Motivation: Understanding financial institutions' roles in interconnected markets is crucial for supervision, risk assessment, and resolution planning.

Method: Proposes a clustering framework using proximity measures, evaluation criteria, and explainable node embeddings based on egonet features.

Result: Identifies roles like market intermediaries and cross-segment connectors using ECB's MMSR data.

Conclusion: Role-based clustering is flexible and valuable for analyzing financial networks and institutional behavior.

Abstract: Understanding the functional roles of financial institutions within
interconnected markets is critical for effective supervision, systemic risk
assessment, and resolution planning. We propose an interpretable role-based
clustering approach for multi-layer financial networks, designed to identify
the functional positions of institutions across different market segments. Our
method follows a general clustering framework defined by proximity measures,
cluster evaluation criteria, and algorithm selection. We construct explainable
node embeddings based on egonet features that capture both direct and indirect
trading relationships within and across market layers. Using transaction-level
data from the ECB's Money Market Statistical Reporting (MMSR), we demonstrate
how the approach uncovers heterogeneous institutional roles such as market
intermediaries, cross-segment connectors, and peripheral lenders or borrowers.
The results highlight the flexibility and practical value of role-based
clustering in analyzing financial networks and understanding institutional
behavior in complex market structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Approximating complex probability distributions, like Bayesian posteriors, is crucial in many applications. The study focuses on the expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations.

Method: The paper reviews two types of geometric Gaussian approximations (Gaussian pushforwards via diffeomorphisms and Riemannian exponential maps), explores their relationship, and provides a constructive proof of their universality.

Result: Geometric Gaussian approximations are shown to be universal, capable of capturing any probability distribution. The paper also investigates uniform approximations for distribution families.

Conclusion: The study confirms the universality of geometric Gaussian approximations and raises questions about uniform approximations for families of distributions.

Abstract: Approximating complex probability distributions, such as Bayesian posterior

expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations. These consist of
approximations by Gaussian pushforwards through diffeomorphisms or Riemannian
exponential maps. We first review these two different kinds of geometric
Gaussian approximations. Then we explore their relationship to one another. We
further provide a constructive proof that such geometric Gaussian
approximations are universal, in that they can capture any probability
distribution. Finally, we discuss whether, given a family of probability
distributions, a common diffeomorphism can be found to obtain uniformly
high-quality geometric Gaussian approximations for that family.

### [276] [Harnessing the Power of Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00671)
*Congye Wang,Matthew A. Fisher,Heishiro Kanagawa,Wilson Chen,Chris. J. Oates*

Main category: stat.CO

TL;DR: The paper addresses the tuning burden in sophisticated sampling algorithms by proposing a novel reward based on contrastive divergence for Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH), demonstrating its effectiveness over traditional rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity of sampling algorithms necessitates adaptive tuning, treated here as a learning task, building on Wang et al.'s (2025) theoretical formulation of Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process.

Method: The paper introduces a novel reward for RLMH based on contrastive divergence, explores adaptive gradient-based samplers, and validates performance via a simulation study using the posteriordb benchmark.

Result: The proposed contrastive divergence-based reward outperforms traditional rewards (e.g., acceptance rate), and RLMH shows practical effectiveness in adaptive sampling.

Conclusion: RLMH, with the novel reward, offers a promising approach to adaptive tuning of sampling algorithms, balancing flexibility and learnability.

Abstract: Sampling algorithms drive probabilistic machine learning, and recent years
have seen an explosion in the diversity of tools for this task. However, the
increasing sophistication of sampling algorithms is correlated with an increase
in the tuning burden. There is now a greater need than ever to treat the tuning
of samplers as a learning task in its own right. In a conceptual breakthrough,
Wang et al (2025) formulated Metropolis-Hastings as a Markov decision process,
opening up the possibility for adaptive tuning using Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Their emphasis was on theoretical foundations; realising the practical
benefit of Reinforcement Learning Metropolis-Hastings (RLMH) was left for
subsequent work. The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we observe the
surprising result that natural choices of reward, such as the acceptance rate,
or the expected squared jump distance, provide insufficient signal for training
RLMH. Instead, we propose a novel reward based on the contrastive divergence,
whose superior performance in the context of RLMH is demonstrated. Second, we
explore the potential of RLMH and present adaptive gradient-based samplers that
balance flexibility of the Markov transition kernel with learnability of the
associated RL task. A comprehensive simulation study using the posteriordb
benchmark supports the practical effectiveness of RLMH.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: A protocol ensures correctness in AI systems by using collateralized claims and recursive verification, where incorrect results are penalized and correct ones rewarded.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In dynamic, low-trust environments, ensuring correctness in autonomous AI agents is challenging without upfront specification or centralized oversight.

Method: Tasks are published as intents; solvers compete to fulfill them, with correctness verified post hoc. Challengers can stake against results to trigger verification, penalizing incorrect agents and rewarding correct ones.

Result: Correctness becomes the Nash equilibrium when incentives align across solvers, challengers, and verifiers.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol enforces correctness through decentralized verification and aligned incentives.

Abstract: Correctness is an emergent property of systems where exposing error is
cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI
agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be
assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a
protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive
verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to
fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness
checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking
against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed
and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes
erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers,
challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash
equilibrium.

TL;DR: A new educational framework integrates GenAI platforms like ChatGPT into lab activities to enhance critical thinking and digital literacy among undergraduates, showing positive engagement and learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of uncritical reliance on LLMs and leverage GenAI as a cognitive tool in education.

Method: Students create discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI responses in text, image, and video formats, tested in a general astronomy course.

Result: High student engagement and critical reflection, with some continuing the activity post-class and presenting at a symposium.

Conclusion: Structured AI interactions in education improve learning, and the model is adaptable across scientific disciplines.

Abstract: This paper presents a new educational framework for integrating generative
artificial intelligence (GenAI) platforms such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
into laboratory activities aimed at developing critical thinking and digital
literacy among undergraduate students. Recognizing the limitations and risks of
uncritical reliance on large language models (LLMs), the proposed pedagogical
model reframes GenAI as a research subject and cognitive tool. Students
formulate discipline-specific prompts and evaluate GenAI-generated responses in
text, image, and video modalities. A pilot implementation in a general
astronomy course for non-science majors demonstrated high levels of engagement
and critical reflection, with many students continuing the activity after class
and presenting results at a research symposium. The results highlight the
importance of structured AI interactions in education and suggest that GenAI
can improve learning outcomes when combined with reflective assessment methods.
The study proposes a replicable model for interdisciplinary AI-integrated lab
work, adaptable to scientific disciplines. See the guide to learning activities

TL;DR: KUL-KT is a biologically inspired knowledge tracing architecture combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based consolidation, enabling scalable, input-agnostic student modeling with graceful forgetting and continual learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve knowledge tracing by mimicking neural memory consolidation, addressing challenges like forgetting and continual learning in student modeling.

Method: KUL-KT uses a fast Hebbian memory for associative updates and a slower linear network for gradient-based consolidation, with innovations like time-decaying Hebbian updates and Loss-aligned Internal Target (LIT) for continual learning.

Result: KUL-KT outperforms baselines on ten benchmarks, improves learner-perceived helpfulness in classroom deployment, and is 1.75x faster with 99.01% less memory than a graph-based model.

Conclusion: KUL-KT is a memory-efficient, biologically grounded framework for scalable personalized learning, validated by empirical results and practical deployment.

Abstract: We introduce KUL-KT, a biologically inspired architecture for knowledge
tracing (KT), combining Hebbian memory encoding with gradient-based
consolidation in a scalable, input-agnostic framework. KUL-KT adapts the
principle of memory consolidation in neural systems, to student modeling by
introducing two key innovations: (i) a time-decaying Hebbian memory update that
enables graceful forgetting, and (ii) a novel Loss-aligned Internal Target
(LIT) method to compute an ideal internal state, allowing continual learning
without backpropagation through time. The architecture consists of a fast
Hebbian memory that captures each learner interaction via a single associative
update, and a slower linear network that consolidates recalled samples through
gradient descent. This design enables few-shot personalization and natural
forgetting without storing raw data or relying on large cohort training.
Operating entirely in embedding space, KUL-KT supports both structured
(tabular) and unstructured (short-answer) inputs. Empirically, KUL-KT
outperforms strong baselines on ten public KT benchmarks in rank-sensitive
metrics such as nDCG and Recall@10. In a classroom deployment, KUL-KT
personalized quizzes from short-answer data, leading to improved
learner-perceived helpfulness and reduced difficulty (p < 0.05). Ablation
studies confirm that Hebbian decay and LIT are critical for continual
adaptation. Compared to a strong graph-based KT model, KUL-KT trains 1.75x
faster and uses 99.01\% less memory. These results position KUL-KT as a
biologically grounded, memory-efficient, and input-flexible framework for
personalized learning at scale.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the impact of AI-driven code generation tools on programming education, advocating for a shift toward teaching code comprehension and execution using visual representations and simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transformation in programming education due to AI tools necessitates reevaluating teaching methods to ensure deeper student understanding.

Method: The article reviews existing studies and proposes visual representations and simulations of code execution as teaching tools, supported by student feedback.

Result: Visual simulations and representations are highlighted as effective for fostering deeper programming comprehension.

Conclusion: Incorporating visual tools in programming courses can enhance learning and assessment, as supported by preliminary student feedback.

Abstract: Computer programming is undergoing a true transformation driven by powerful
new tools for automatic source code generation based on large language models.
This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at
universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how
programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of
generative artificial intelligence.
  This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on
this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the
specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and
learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather
than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for
the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its
execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming,
thus fostering a deeper understanding among students.
  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming
course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the
incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the
training process.

Main category: econ.TH

TL;DR: The paper examines how AI disrupts traditional accountability in transnational governance, proposing new frameworks and strategies for responsible AI adoption in accounting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI-driven innovations challenge traditional accountability mechanisms in global governance, necessitating new approaches.

Method: Integrates Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and institutional theory to analyze AI adoption under regulatory and ethical pressures.

Result: Accountability is co-constructed in socio-technical networks, influenced by governance logics and normative expectations. Two strategies are proposed for responsible AI adoption.

Conclusion: AI adoption requires rethinking accountability as relational and emergent, with internal and external strategies to ensure legitimacy and compliance.

Abstract: This study explores how AI-powered digital innovations are reshaping
organisational accountability in a transnational governance context. As AI
systems increasingly mediate decision-making in domains such as auditing and
financial reporting, traditional mechanisms of accountability, based on
control, transparency, and auditability, are being destabilised. We integrate
the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and
institutional theory to examine how organisations adopt AI technologies in
response to regulatory, ethical, and cultural pressures that transcend national
boundaries. We argue that accountability is co-constructed within global
socio-technical networks, shaped not only by user perceptions but also by
governance logics and normative expectations. Extending TAM, we incorporate
compliance and legitimacy as key factors in perceived usefulness and usability.
Drawing on ANT, we reconceptualise accountability as a relational and emergent
property of networked assemblages. We propose two organisational strategies
including internal governance reconfiguration and external actor-network
engagement to foster responsible, legitimate, and globally accepted AI adoption
in the accounting domain.

*Jin-Hong Du,Kathryn Roeder,Larry Wasserman*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: DFI addresses correlation-induced bias in feature importance by transforming features into independent latent variables using optimal transport, providing accurate and computationally efficient importance scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard feature importance methods underestimate contributions when predictors are correlated, necessitating a solution to eliminate this bias.

Method: DFI uses optimal transport to disentangle correlated features into independent latent variables, computing importance in this space and attributing it back through the transport map's sensitivity.

Result: DFI offers a principled decomposition of importance scores, achieves root-$n$ consistency, and avoids computational burdens of traditional methods.

Conclusion: DFI provides a robust, efficient, and theoretically sound solution for feature importance quantification under correlation.

Abstract: Feature importance quantification faces a fundamental challenge: when
predictors are correlated, standard methods systematically underestimate their
contributions. We prove that major existing approaches target identical
population functionals under squared-error loss, revealing why they share this
correlation-induced bias.
  To address this limitation, we introduce \emph{Disentangled Feature
Importance (DFI)}, a nonparametric generalization of the classical $R^2$
decomposition via optimal transport. DFI transforms correlated features into
independent latent variables using a transport map, eliminating correlation
distortion. Importance is computed in this disentangled space and attributed
back through the transport map's sensitivity. DFI provides a principled
decomposition of importance scores that sum to the total predictive variability
for latent additive models and to interaction-weighted functional ANOVA
variances more generally, under arbitrary feature dependencies.
  We develop a comprehensive semiparametric theory for DFI. For general
transport maps, we establish root-$n$ consistency and asymptotic normality of
importance estimators in the latent space, which extends to the original
feature space for the Bures-Wasserstein map. Notably, our estimators achieve
second-order estimation error, which vanishes if both regression function and
transport map estimation errors are $o_{\mathbb{P}}(n^{-1/4})$. By design, DFI
avoids the computational burden of repeated submodel refitting and the
challenges of conditional covariate distribution estimation, thereby achieving
computational efficiency.

Result: Validated efficacy on datasets, including astronomical simulations, showing improved disentanglement.

Conclusion: Aux-VAE effectively disentangles latent factors with minimal modifications to standard VAE loss.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of statistically extracting generative

semi-supervised settings. We investigate encoder-decoder-based generative
models for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, focusing on disentangling
low-dimensional latent variables corresponding to independent physical factors.
Introducing Aux-VAE, a novel architecture within the classical Variational
Autoencoder framework, we achieve disentanglement with minimal modifications to
the standard VAE loss function by leveraging prior statistical knowledge
through auxiliary variables. These variables guide the shaping of the latent
space by aligning latent factors with learned auxiliary variables. We validate
the efficacy of Aux-VAE through comparative assessments on multiple datasets,

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: GRAND is the first method to release entire networks with node-level differential privacy while preserving structural properties, proven effective under latent space models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for node-level privacy in networks are limited to query-based approaches or fail to preserve structural properties, leaving a gap for a comprehensive solution.

Method: Proposes GRAND, a network release mechanism ensuring node-level differential privacy and structural preservation, validated under latent space models.

Result: The released network asymptotically matches the original network's distribution, with effectiveness confirmed via synthetic and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: GRAND successfully addresses the gap in node-level privacy for networks, offering a robust and practical solution.

Abstract: Differential privacy is a well-established framework for safeguarding
sensitive information in data. While extensively applied across various
domains, its application to network data -- particularly at the node level --
remains underexplored. Existing methods for node-level privacy either focus
exclusively on query-based approaches, which restrict output to pre-specified
network statistics, or fail to preserve key structural properties of the
network. In this work, we propose GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node
Differential privacy), which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
network release mechanism that releases entire networks while ensuring
node-level differential privacy and preserving structural properties. Under a
broad class of latent space models, we show that the released network
asymptotically follows the same distribution as the original network. The
effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a forward-reverse iterative Monte Carlo method to approximate Schrödinger potentials nonparametrically, ensuring convergence and optimality, with applications in Schrödinger Bridge processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Schrödinger Bridge Problem (SBP) is central to entropic optimal transport, but general cases lack efficient nonparametric solutions.

Method: A forward-reverse iterative Monte Carlo procedure using kernel-based regression and Picard iteration, preserving positivity and contractivity.

Result: The algorithm is provably convergent with optimal convergence rates for potential estimates.

Conclusion: The method is applied to Schrödinger Bridge processes, demonstrating practical utility.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (SBP), which is
central to entropic optimal transport. For general reference processes and
begin--endpoint distributions, we propose a forward-reverse iterative Monte
Carlo procedure to approximate the Schr\"odinger potentials in a nonparametric
way. In particular, we use kernel based Monte Carlo regression in the context
of Picard iteration of a corresponding fixed point problem. By preserving in
the iteration positivity and contractivity in a Hilbert metric sense, we
develop a provably convergent algorithm. Furthermore, we provide convergence
rates for the potential estimates and prove their optimality. Finally, as an
application, we propose a non-nested Monte Carlo procedure for the final
dimensional distributions of the Schr\"odinger Bridge process, based on the
constructed potentials and the forward-reverse simulation method for
conditional diffusions.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) is an optimal transport distance suited for point cloud alignment and comparison. The paper validates PW as a distance, extends its framework with initialization strategies, introduces PW barycenters, and demonstrates superior performance in alignment and shape preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a robust distance metric invariant to rigid transformations (rotations, reflections) for tasks like point cloud alignment and comparison motivated the introduction of PW.

Method: The paper constructs a space of discrete probability measures to validate PW as a distance, extends PW with initialization strategies, and introduces PW barycenters with a detailed estimation algorithm.

Result: PW outperforms existing OT methods in alignment and shape preservation, with applications in archaeology and point cloud analysis.

Conclusion: PW is a promising tool for 2D/3D point cloud analysis, enhancing machine learning and computational geometry applications.

Abstract: Due to its invariance to rigid transformations such as rotations and
reflections, Procrustes-Wasserstein (PW) was introduced in the literature as an
optimal transport (OT) distance, alternative to Wasserstein and more suited to
tasks such as the alignment and comparison of point clouds. Having that
application in mind, we carefully build a space of discrete probability
measures and show that over that space PW actually is a distance. Algorithms to
solve the PW problems already exist, however we extend the PW framework by
discussing and testing several initialization strategies. We then introduce the
notion of PW barycenter and detail an algorithm to estimate it from the data.
The result is a new method to compute representative shapes from a collection
of point clouds. We benchmark our method against existing OT approaches,
demonstrating superior performance in scenarios requiring precise alignment and
shape preservation. We finally show the usefulness of the PW barycenters in an
archaeological context. Our results highlight the potential of PW in boosting
2D and 3D point cloud analysis for machine learning and computational geometry
applications.

Motivation: Predicting post popularity is challenging due to complex interactions between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral factors.

Result: Achieved third place in SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track) with competitive performance.

Conclusion: HyperFusion effectively addresses the complexity of social media popularity prediction through multimodal fusion and hierarchical ensemble learning.

Abstract: Social media popularity prediction plays a crucial role in content
optimization, marketing strategies, and user engagement enhancement across
digital platforms. However, predicting post popularity remains challenging due
to the complex interplay between visual, textual, temporal, and user behavioral
factors. This paper presents HyperFusion, a hierarchical multimodal ensemble
learning framework for social media popularity prediction. Our approach employs
a three-tier fusion architecture that progressively integrates features across
abstraction levels: visual representations from CLIP encoders, textual
embeddings from transformer models, and temporal-spatial metadata with user
characteristics. The framework implements a hierarchical ensemble strategy
combining CatBoost, TabNet, and custom multi-layer perceptrons. To address
limited labeled data, we propose a two-stage training methodology with
pseudo-labeling and iterative refinement. We introduce novel cross-modal
similarity measures and hierarchical clustering features that capture
inter-modal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperFusion
achieves competitive performance on the SMP challenge dataset. Our team
achieved third place in the SMP Challenge 2025 (Image Track). The source code

TL;DR: A SINDy variant is developed to efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics by first identifying the slow manifold and then learning the dynamics on it, reducing computational complexity and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems make regression problems computationally intractable and ill-conditioned, necessitating a more efficient method.

Method: The approach involves two steps: (i) identifying the slow manifold and (ii) learning the slow dynamics on the manifold using a tailored, sparse library of candidate terms.

Result: The method reduces the condition number and library size, enabling accurate identification of slow manifold dynamics, as demonstrated on a buckling beam and airfoil flow.

Conclusion: The proposed SINDy variant effectively addresses challenges in modeling slow-fast systems by leveraging manifold-informed libraries, improving computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) has been established
as an effective method to learn interpretable models of dynamical systems from
data. However, for high-dimensional slow-fast dynamical systems, the regression
problem becomes simultaneously computationally intractable and ill-conditioned.
Although, in principle, modeling only the dynamics evolving on the underlying
slow manifold addresses both of these challenges, the truncated fast variables
have to be compensated by including higher-order nonlinearities as candidate
terms for the model, leading to an explosive growth in the size of the SINDy
library. In this work, we develop a SINDy variant that is able to robustly and
efficiently identify slow-fast dynamics in two steps: (i) identify the slow
manifold, that is, an algebraic equation for the fast variables as functions of
the slow ones, and (ii) learn a model for the dynamics of the slow variables
restricted to the manifold. Critically, the equation learned in (i) is
leveraged to build a manifold-informed function library for (ii) that contains
only essential higher-order nonlinearites as candidate terms. Rather than
containing all monomials of up to a certain degree, the resulting custom
library is a sparse subset of the latter that is tailored to the specific
problem at hand. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples of a
snap-through buckling beam and the flow over a NACA 0012 airfoil. We find that
our method significantly reduces both the condition number and the size of the
SINDy library, thus enabling accurate identification of the dynamics on slow
manifolds.

Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs in real-world scientific workflows, such as memory, planning, and tool integration.

Method: Dynamic agent construction from source code docs, augmented with FSA memory for state tracking and context-aware decisions.

Result: Reliable execution, adaptive planning, and interpretable state transitions in tasks like bioassay retrieval and hardware integration.

Conclusion: Memory and state awareness are key for agentic planning, providing a foundation for AI agents in complex environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled powerful advances in natural
language understanding and generation. Yet their application to complex,
real-world scientific workflows remain limited by challenges in memory,
planning, and tool integration. Here, we introduce SciBORG (Scientific Bespoke
Artificial Intelligence Agents Optimized for Research Goals), a modular agentic
framework that allows LLM-based agents to autonomously plan, reason, and
achieve robust and reliable domain-specific task execution. Agents are
constructed dynamically from source code documentation and augmented with
finite-state automata (FSA) memory, enabling persistent state tracking and
context-aware decision-making. This approach eliminates the need for manual
prompt engineering and allows for robust, scalable deployment across diverse
applications via maintaining context across extended workflows and to recover
from tool or execution failures. We validate SciBORG through integration with
both physical and virtual hardware, such as microwave synthesizers for
executing user-specified reactions, with context-aware decision making and
demonstrate its use in autonomous multi-step bioassay retrieval from the
PubChem database utilizing multi-step planning, reasoning, agent-to-agent
communication and coordination for execution of exploratory tasks. Systematic
benchmarking shows that SciBORG agents achieve reliable execution, adaptive
planning, and interpretable state transitions. Our results show that memory and
state awareness are critical enablers of agentic planning and reliability,
offering a generalizable foundation for deploying AI agents in complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying cAI systems on mobile edge platforms is challenging due to dynamic workloads and the need for concurrent DNN-transformer inference, which existing strategies cannot handle.

Method: Twill uses task affinity-aware cluster mapping, migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and DVFS to manage concurrent cAI workloads.

Result: Twill reduces inference latency by 54% on average compared to state-of-the-art edge AI techniques while staying within power budgets.

Conclusion: Twill effectively addresses the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous mobile edge platforms, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Compound AI (cAI) systems chain multiple AI models to solve complex problems.
cAI systems are typically composed of deep neural networks (DNNs),
transformers, and large language models (LLMs), exhibiting a high degree of
computational diversity and dynamic workload variation. Deploying cAI services
on mobile edge platforms poses a significant challenge in scheduling concurrent
DNN-transformer inference tasks, which arrive dynamically in an unknown
sequence. Existing mobile edge AI inference strategies manage multi-DNN or
transformer-only workloads, relying on design-time profiling, and cannot handle
concurrent inference of DNNs and transformers required by cAI systems. In this
work, we address the challenge of scheduling cAI systems on heterogeneous
mobile edge platforms. We present Twill, a run-time framework to handle
concurrent inference requests of cAI workloads through task affinity-aware
cluster mapping and migration, priority-aware task freezing/unfreezing, and
DVFS, while minimizing inference latency within power budgets. We implement and
deploy our Twill framework on the Nvidia Jetson Orin NX platform. We evaluate
Twill against state-of-the-art edge AI inference techniques over contemporary
DNNs and LLMs, reducing inference latency by 54% on average, while honoring
power budgets.

Motivation: To leverage LLMs for creating efficient, livable, and sustainable cities by addressing complex urban problems through autonomous decision-making.

Method: Introduces urban LLM agents, surveys their workflows (sensing, memory, reasoning, execution, learning), and categorizes applications (urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, society).

Result: A comprehensive survey establishing the foundation for urban LLM agents, highlighting their potential and current research landscape.

Conclusion: Urban LLM agents hold promise for advancing urban intelligence, but trustworthiness, evaluation, and open problems need addressing for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The long-standing vision of intelligent cities is to create efficient,
livable, and sustainable urban environments using big data and artificial
intelligence technologies. Recently, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has opened new ways toward realizing this vision. With powerful semantic
understanding and reasoning capabilities, LLMs can be deployed as intelligent
agents capable of autonomously solving complex problems across domains. In this
article, we focus on Urban LLM Agents, which are LLM-powered agents that are
semi-embodied within the hybrid cyber-physical-social space of cities and used
for system-level urban decision-making. First, we introduce the concept of
urban LLM agents, discussing their unique capabilities and features. Second, we
survey the current research landscape from the perspective of agent workflows,
encompassing urban sensing, memory management, reasoning, execution, and
learning. Third, we categorize the application domains of urban LLM agents into
five groups: urban planning, transportation, environment, public safety, and
urban society, presenting representative works in each group. Finally, we
discuss trustworthiness and evaluation issues that are critical for real-world
deployment, and identify several open problems for future research. This survey
aims to establish a foundation for the emerging field of urban LLM agents and
to provide a roadmap for advancing the intersection of LLMs and urban
intelligence. A curated list of relevant papers and open-source resources is

### [292] [Feature Integration Spaces: Joint Training Reveals Dual Encoding in Neural Network Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00269)
*Omar Claflin*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dual encoding hypothesis for neural networks, introducing architectures to capture feature identity and integration simultaneously, achieving significant improvements in reconstruction and error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit behavioral errors, prompting the need for a new encoding hypothesis.

Method: Developed sequential and joint-training architectures to test the dual encoding hypothesis, focusing on feature identity and integration.

Result: Joint training improved reconstruction by 41.3% and reduced KL divergence errors by 51.6%. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieved 16.5% standalone improvements.

Conclusion: The work provides evidence for dual encoding, meaningful nonlinear feature interactions, and introduces a new architectural paradigm for next-generation SAEs.

Abstract: Current sparse autoencoder (SAE) approaches to neural network
interpretability assume that activations can be decomposed through linear
superposition into sparse, interpretable features. Despite high reconstruction
fidelity, SAEs consistently fail to eliminate polysemanticity and exhibit
pathological behavioral errors. We propose that neural networks encode
information in two complementary spaces compressed into the same substrate:
feature identity and feature integration. To test this dual encoding
hypothesis, we develop sequential and joint-training architectures to capture
identity and integration patterns simultaneously. Joint training achieves 41.3%
reconstruction improvement and 51.6% reduction in KL divergence errors. This
architecture spontaneously develops bimodal feature organization: low squared
norm features contributing to integration pathways and the rest contributing
directly to the residual. Small nonlinear components (3% of parameters) achieve
16.5% standalone improvements, demonstrating parameter-efficient capture of
computational relationships crucial for behavior. Additionally, intervention
experiments using 2x2 factorial stimulus designs demonstrated that integration
features exhibit selective sensitivity to experimental manipulations and
produce systematic behavioral effects on model outputs, including significant
interaction effects across semantic dimensions. This work provides systematic
evidence for (1) dual encoding in neural representations, (2) meaningful
nonlinearly encoded feature interactions, and (3) introduces an architectural
paradigm shift from post-hoc feature analysis to integrated computational
design, establishing foundations for next-generation SAEs.

*Hoang Cuong Phan,Minh Tien Tran,Chihun Lee,Hoheok Kim,Sehyok Oh,Dong-Kyu Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: A novel process-aware generative model using SD3.5-Large for microstructure synthesis, addressing data scarcity and computational constraints, validated with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding process-structure relationships in materials design is challenging due to limited training data and continuous processing variables.

Method: Adapts SD3.5-Large with numeric-aware embeddings for continuous variables, fine-tuned via DreamBooth and LoRA, and validated using a semantic segmentation model.

Result: Achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean IoU, with synthetic microstructures closely matching real ones in physical descriptors and spatial statistics.

Conclusion: First adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation, offering a scalable solution for materials design.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic microstructure images conditioned on processing
parameters is crucial for understanding process-structure relationships in
materials design. However, this task remains challenging due to limited
training micrographs and the continuous nature of processing variables. To
overcome these challenges, we present a novel process-aware generative modeling
approach based on Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large (SD3.5-Large), a state-of-the-art
text-to-image diffusion model adapted for microstructure generation. Our method
introduces numeric-aware embeddings that encode continuous variables (annealing
temperature, time, and magnification) directly into the model's conditioning,
enabling controlled image generation under specified process conditions and
capturing process-driven microstructural variations. To address data scarcity
and computational constraints, we fine-tune only a small fraction of the
model's weights via DreamBooth and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently
transferring the pre-trained model to the materials domain. We validate realism
using a semantic segmentation model based on a fine-tuned U-Net with a VGG16
encoder on 24 labeled micrographs. It achieves 97.1% accuracy and 85.7% mean
IoU, outperforming previous methods. Quantitative analyses using physical
descriptors and spatial statistics show strong agreement between synthetic and
real microstructures. Specifically, two-point correlation and lineal-path
errors remain below 2.1% and 0.6%, respectively. Our method represents the
first adaptation of SD3.5-Large for process-aware microstructure generation,
offering a scalable approach for data-driven materials design.

*Satadeep Bhattacharjee,Seung-Cheol Lee*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper validates the spin-bath analogy in LLMs by analyzing GPT-2's attention heads, showing a strong correlation between theoretical predictions and empirical token rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically test the physics-based framework modeling LLM attention as a two-body spin system and provide interpretability insights.

Method: Extract Query-Key weight matrices from GPT-2, derive effective Hamiltonians, and evaluate phase boundaries against empirical token rankings.

Result: Strong negative correlation (r≈-0.70, p<10^-3) between theoretical logit gaps and empirical rankings, confirmed by targeted ablations.

Conclusion: The spin-bath analogy is empirically validated, offering a physics-inspired interpretability tool and potential for novel generative models.

Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and
Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a
first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building
on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a
production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian
for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians we obtain analytic
\textit{phase boundaries} logit gap criteria that predict which token should
dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic
evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong
negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's
empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p<10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations
further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath
predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming
a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our
findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy
in a production-grade model. This validation not only furnishes a tractable,
physics-inspired lens for interpretability but also provides the groundwork for
novel generative models, bridging the gap between theoretical condensed matter
physics and AI.

*Gunjan Auti,Hirofumi Daiguji,Gouhei Tanaka*

Main category: nlin.AO

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a self-organizing framework that uses local Hebbian updates driven by conservation law violations, eliminating the need for global optimization and external constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional machine learning in physics relies on global optimization, which limits interpretability and requires external enforcement of physical constraints. HPN aims to address these limitations.

Method: HPN uses local Hebbian updates driven by residuals (imbalances in continuity, momentum, or energy) to encode physical laws directly into the system's dynamics, inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics and Prigogine's theory.

Result: HPN successfully models incompressible fluid flow and continuum diffusion, with physically consistent structures emerging from random initial conditions without supervision.

Conclusion: HPN offers an interpretable, scalable, and physically grounded alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems by reframing computation as a residual-driven thermodynamic process.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning approaches in physics rely on global
optimization, limiting interpretability and enforcing physical constraints
externally. We introduce the Hebbian Physics Network (HPN), a self-organizing
computational framework in which learning emerges from local Hebbian updates
driven by violations of conservation laws. Grounded in non-equilibrium
thermodynamics and inspired by Prigogine/'s theory of dissipative structures,
HPNs eliminate the need for global loss functions by encoding physical laws
directly into the system/'s local dynamics. Residuals - quantified imbalances
in continuity, momentum, or energy - serve as thermodynamic signals that drive
weight adaptation through generalized Hebbian plasticity. We demonstrate this
approach on incompressible fluid flow and continuum diffusion, where physically
consistent structures emerge from random initial conditions without
supervision. HPNs reframe computation as a residual-driven thermodynamic
process, offering an interpretable, scalable, and physically grounded
alternative for modeling complex dynamical systems.

*William H English,Chase Walker,Dominic Simon,Sumit Kumar Jha,Rickard Ewetz*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLTL-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating NL-to-TL translation systems, focusing on verifiability and grounding, addressing gaps in current benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for NL-to-TL translation ignore grounding atomic propositions in new scenarios, limiting practical verification.

Method: VLTL-Bench includes diverse NL specifications, formal TL expressions, and sample traces, supporting end-to-end evaluation and substep analysis.

Result: The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of translation frameworks, including grounding and verification steps.

Conclusion: VLTL-Bench addresses critical gaps in NL-to-TL evaluation, promoting domain-general and verifiable systems.

Abstract: Empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art natural-language (NL) to
temporal-logic (TL) translation systems reveals near-perfect performance on
existing benchmarks. However, current studies measure only the accuracy of the
translation of NL logic into formal TL, ignoring a system's capacity to ground
atomic propositions into new scenarios or environments. This is a critical
feature, necessary for the verification of resulting formulas in a concrete
state space. Consequently, most NL-to-TL translation frameworks propose their
own bespoke dataset in which the correct grounding is known a-priori, inflating
performance metrics and neglecting the need for extensible, domain-general
systems. In this paper, we introduce the Verifiable Linear Temporal Logic
Benchmark ( VLTL-Bench), a unifying benchmark that measures verification and
verifiability of automated NL-to-LTL translation. The dataset consists of three
unique state spaces and thousands of diverse natural language specifications
and corresponding formal specifications in temporal logic. Moreover, the
benchmark contains sample traces to validate the temporal logic expressions.
While the benchmark directly supports end-to-end evaluation, we observe that
many frameworks decompose the process into i) lifting, ii) grounding, iii)
translation, and iv) verification. The benchmark provides ground truths after
each of these steps to enable researches to improve and evaluate different
substeps of the overall problem. To encourage methodologically sound advances
in verifiable NL-to-LTL translation approaches, we release VLTL-Bench here:

### [297] [Augmented Physics-Based Li-ion Battery Model via Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Learning and Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00353)
*Samuel Filgueira da Silva,Mehmet Fatih Ozkan,Faissal El Idrissi,Marcello Canova*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework to improve reduced-order lithium-ion battery models, enhancing accuracy and reliability under high C-rate conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate electrochemical models are crucial for lithium-ion battery applications, but reduced-order models often fail to capture complex behaviors, especially under high C-rate conditions.

Method: The AESI framework integrates an Extended Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning strategy and uses conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification.

Result: The hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves voltage prediction accuracy by up to 46% and provides reliable prediction intervals with coverage ratios of 96.85% and 97.41%.

Conclusion: The AESI framework effectively addresses the limitations of reduced-order models, offering improved accuracy and reliability for lithium-ion battery applications.

Abstract: Accurate electrochemical models are essential for the safe and efficient
operation of lithium-ion batteries in real-world applications such as
electrified vehicles and grid storage. Reduced-order models (ROM) offer a
balance between fidelity and computational efficiency but often struggle to
capture complex and nonlinear behaviors, such as the dynamics in the cell
voltage response under high C-rate conditions. To address these limitations,
this study proposes an Adaptive Ensemble Sparse Identification (AESI) framework
that enhances the accuracy of reduced-order li-ion battery models by
compensating for unpredictable dynamics. The approach integrates an Extended
Single Particle Model (ESPM) with an evolutionary ensemble sparse learning
strategy to construct a robust hybrid model. In addition, the AESI framework
incorporates a conformal prediction method to provide theoretically guaranteed
uncertainty quantification for voltage error dynamics, thereby improving the
reliability of the model's predictions. Evaluation across diverse operating
conditions shows that the hybrid model (ESPM + AESI) improves the voltage
prediction accuracy, achieving mean squared error reductions of up to 46% on
unseen data. Prediction reliability is further supported by conformal
prediction, yielding statistically valid prediction intervals with coverage
ratios of 96.85% and 97.41% for the ensemble models based on bagging and
stability selection, respectively.

*Feng Wang,Shengyu Zhang,Een-Kee Hong,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework to optimize DS2D connectivity in multi-constellation environments by dynamically forming sub-constellations and using predictive beamforming and pre-configured handover paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of managing DS2D connectivity in multi-constellation environments, including high interference and frequent handovers, limits service performance. Existing single-constellation approaches fail to exploit multi-constellation potential.

Method: The CaaS framework treats multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool, forming optimal sub-constellations per service region. It uses predictive satellite beamforming (GenAI) and pre-configured handover paths.

Result: Simulations show CaaS improves satellite service rates and reduces handover overhead.

Conclusion: CaaS is an efficient and sustainable solution for DS2D connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

Abstract: Direct-satellite-to-device (DS2D) communication is emerging as a promising
solution for global mobile service extension, leveraging the deployment of
satellite constellations. However, the challenge of managing DS2D connectivity
for multi-constellations becomes outstanding, including high interference and
frequent handovers caused by multi-coverage overlap and rapid satellite
movement. Moreover, existing approaches primarily operate within
single-constellation shell, which inherently limits the ability to exploit the
vast potential of multi-constellation connectivity provision, resulting in
suboptimal DS2D service performances. To address these challenges, this article
proposes a Constellation as a Service (CaaS) framework, which treats the entire
multi-constellation infrastructure as a shared resource pool and dynamically
forms optimal sub-constellations (SCs) for each DS2D service region. The
formation of each SC integrates satellites from various orbits to provide
tailored connectivity based on user demands, guided by two innovative
strategies: predictive satellite beamforming using generative artificial
intelligence (GenAI) and pre-configured handover path for efficient satellite
access and mobility management. Simulation results demonstrate that CaaS
significantly improves satellite service rates while reducing handover
overhead, making it an efficient and continuable solution for managing DS2D
connectivity in multi-constellation environments.

*Ankit Biswas*

Main category: astro-ph.SR

TL;DR: A machine learning framework for detecting late-T and Y dwarfs using synthetic photometry, achieving high accuracy and discovering a new T8.2 candidate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The census of late-T and Y dwarfs is incomplete due to limited observational data, necessitating a new detection method.

Method: Uses synthetic photometry from atmospheric models (ATMO 2020, Sonora Bobcat) to train an ensemble of classifiers for spectral type classification.

Result: High performance (>99% classification accuracy, 0.35 subtype precision) and discovery of a new T8.2 candidate.

Conclusion: The framework effectively identifies faint late-type UCDs, demonstrating its potential for future discoveries.

Abstract: The T and Y spectral classes represent the coolest and lowest-mass population
of brown dwarfs, yet their census remains incomplete due to limited statistics.
Existing detection frameworks are often constrained to identifying M, L, and
early T dwarfs, owing to the sparse observational sample of ultracool dwarfs
(UCDs) at later types. This paper presents a novel machine learning framework
capable of detecting and classifying late-T and Y dwarfs, trained entirely on
synthetic photometry from atmospheric models. Utilizing grids from the ATMO
2020 and Sonora Bobcat models, I produce a training dataset over two orders of
magnitude larger than any empirical set of >T6 UCDs. Polynomial color relations
fitted to the model photometry are used to assign spectral types to these
synthetic models, which in turn train an ensemble of classifiers to identify
and classify the spectral type of late UCDs. The model is highly performant
when validating on both synthetic and empirical datasets, verifying catalogs of
known UCDs with object classification metrics >99% and an average spectral type
precision within 0.35 +/- 0.37 subtypes. Application of the model to a 1.5
degree region around Pisces and the UKIDSS UDS field results in the discovery
of one previously uncatalogued T8.2 candidate, demonstrating the ability of
this model-trained approach in discovering faint, late-type UCDs from
photometric catalogs.

*Xingyu Xiao,Jiejuan Tong,Peng Chen,Jun Sun,Zhe Sui,Jingang Liang,Hongru Zhao,Jun Zhao,Haitao Wang*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes InSight-R, a framework for automated human failure event (HFE) identification and interface-induced risk assessment, addressing limitations of traditional HRA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HRA methods rely on expert judgment, leading to reproducibility and subjectivity issues, and lack integration of interface-level data.

Method: The InSight-R framework uses AutoGraph to link empirical behavioral data to an interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) for automated HFE identification.

Result: InSight-R improves objectivity and interpretability in HFE identification and supports dynamic, real-time human reliability assessment.

Conclusion: The framework advances mechanism-driven HRA methodologies and offers insights for interface design optimization.

Abstract: Human reliability remains a critical concern in safety-critical domains such
as nuclear power, where operational failures are often linked to human error.
While conventional human reliability analysis (HRA) methods have been widely
adopted, they rely heavily on expert judgment for identifying human failure
events (HFEs) and assigning performance influencing factors (PIFs). This
reliance introduces challenges related to reproducibility, subjectivity, and
limited integration of interface-level data. In particular, current approaches
lack the capacity to rigorously assess how human-machine interface design
contributes to operator performance variability and error susceptibility. To
address these limitations, this study proposes a framework for risk-informed
human failure event identification and interface-induced risk assessment driven
by AutoGraph (InSight-R). By linking empirical behavioral data to the
interface-embedded knowledge graph (IE-KG) constructed by the automated
graph-based execution framework (AutoGraph), the InSight-R framework enables
automated HFE identification based on both error-prone and time-deviated
operational paths. Furthermore, we discuss the relationship between
designer-user conflicts and human error. The results demonstrate that InSight-R
not only enhances the objectivity and interpretability of HFE identification
but also provides a scalable pathway toward dynamic, real-time human
reliability assessment in digitalized control environments. This framework
offers actionable insights for interface design optimization and contributes to
the advancement of mechanism-driven HRA methodologies.

*Christopher M. Wegemer,Edward Halim,Jeff Burke*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS) uses adaptive narratives and emotion recognition to reduce political polarization and promote open-mindedness in students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political polarization hinders civic education by resisting opposing viewpoints. AI technologies can help mitigate this by fostering emotional engagement and perspective-taking.

Method: The study employs a design-based research approach, integrating facial emotion recognition, attention tracking, and GPT-4 for personalized storytelling.

Result: The AI-DCS platform successfully sustains emotional engagement and promotes perspective-taking toward political out-groups.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for AI-driven, emotionally-sensitive civic education tools, with implications for algorithmic literacy and HCI challenges.

Abstract: Political polarization undermines democratic civic education by exacerbating
identity-based resistance to opposing viewpoints. Emerging AI technologies
offer new opportunities to advance interventions that reduce polarization and
promote political open-mindedness. We examined novel design strategies that
leverage adaptive and emotionally-responsive civic narratives that may sustain
students' emotional engagement in stories, and in turn, promote
perspective-taking toward members of political out-groups. Drawing on theories
from political psychology and narratology, we investigate how affective
computing techniques can support three storytelling mechanisms: transportation
into a story world, identification with characters, and interaction with the
storyteller. Using a design-based research (DBR) approach, we iteratively
developed and refined an AI-mediated Digital Civic Storytelling (AI-DCS)
platform. Our prototype integrates facial emotion recognition and attention
tracking to assess users' affective and attentional states in real time.
Narrative content is organized around pre-structured story outlines, with
beat-by-beat language adaptation implemented via GPT-4, personalizing
linguistic tone to sustain students' emotional engagement in stories that
center political perspectives different from their own. Our work offers a
foundation for AI-supported, emotionally-sensitive strategies that address
affective polarization while preserving learner autonomy. We conclude with
implications for civic education interventions, algorithmic literacy, and HCI
challenges associated with AI dialogue management and affect-adaptive learning
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how BLV individuals use GenAI tools and address the privacy challenges they face.

Method: Conducted an interview study with 21 BLV participants to investigate practices and design preferences.

Result: Identified six privacy risk scenarios and design preferences like on-device processing and sensitive content redaction.

Conclusion: Provides actionable design recommendations for user-centered visual privacy in GenAI tools.

Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to
interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can
enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user
independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In
this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences
of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21
participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that
balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for
privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation,
indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional
content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device
processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction,
privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored
interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to
support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of
privacy and responsible handling of others data.

TL;DR: A shooting visualization system using first-person video and overlaid metrics was developed and tested, showing preference for a dashboard-style view among both novice and expert shooters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current marksmanship training lacks real-time, first-person insights, relying instead on post-session analysis. This study aims to improve coaching by integrating visual analytics.

Method: Five composite visualizations were created using enriched first-person shooting videos. These were evaluated with 10 participants (5 experts, 5 novices) through tasks, comparisons, and interviews.

Result: A dashboard-style view combining raw video, polar plots, and graphs was preferred by 9 of 10 participants and enhanced understanding across skill levels.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of integrating first-person video with visual analytics for precision sports coaching, suggesting broader applications.

Abstract: Marksmanship practices are required in various professions, including police,
military personnel, hunters, as well as sports shooters, such as Olympic
shooting, biathlon, and modern pentathlon. The current form of training and
coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through
the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy
post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and
evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To
achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person
shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical
summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen,
5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming
interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured
interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining
raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases
and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this
design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with
visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this
approach to other precision-based sports.

Motivation: To understand how CSRs perceive AI assistance in customer interactions.

Method: Field visits and semi-structured interviews with 13 CSRs.

Result: AI reduces traditional burdens (typing, memorizing) but introduces new ones (earning, compliance, psychological).

Conclusion: AI integration in organizations requires balancing benefits and new burdens for employees.

Abstract: The integration of various AI tools creates a complex socio-technical
environment where employee-customer interactions form the core of work
practices. This study investigates how customer service representatives (CSRs)
at the power grid service customer service call center perceive AI assistance
in their interactions with customers. Through a field visit and semi-structured
interviews with 13 CSRs, we found that AI can alleviate some traditional
burdens during the call (e.g., typing and memorizing) but also introduces new
burdens (e.g., earning, compliance, psychological burdens). This research
contributes to a more nuanced understanding of AI integration in organizational
settings and highlights the efforts and burdens undertaken by CSRs to adapt to

TL;DR: LLMs simulate political discourse on social media, showing amplified polarization and harmful language due to "generation exaggeration," compromising their reliability as social proxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs behave when simulating political discourse and their potential biases in social media interactions.

Method: Constructed LLM agents based on real users, comparing Zero Shot and Few Shot initialization, and evaluated models on linguistic style, ideological consistency, and toxicity.

Result: Richer contextualization improves consistency but increases polarization and harmful language. LLMs reconstruct users rather than emulate them, introducing biases.

Conclusion: LLMs' structural biases challenge their use in content moderation, simulations, and policy modeling.

Abstract: We investigate how Large Language Models (LLMs) behave when simulating
political discourse on social media. Leveraging 21 million interactions on X
during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we construct LLM agents based on
1,186 real users, prompting them to reply to politically salient tweets under
controlled conditions. Agents are initialized either with minimal ideological
cues (Zero Shot) or recent tweet history (Few Shot), allowing one-to-one
comparisons with human replies. We evaluate three model families (Gemini,
Mistral, and DeepSeek) across linguistic style, ideological consistency, and
toxicity. We find that richer contextualization improves internal consistency
but also amplifies polarization, stylized signals, and harmful language. We
observe an emergent distortion that we call "generation exaggeration": a
systematic amplification of salient traits beyond empirical baselines. Our
analysis shows that LLMs do not emulate users, they reconstruct them. Their
outputs, indeed, reflect internal optimization dynamics more than observed
behavior, introducing structural biases that compromise their reliability as
social proxies. This challenges their use in content moderation, deliberative
simulations, and policy modeling.

### [306] [Control-Optimized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Artificially Intelligent Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00268)
*Oren Fivel,Matan Rudman,Kobi Cohen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel DRL framework addresses action execution mismatches in real-world applications by modeling and compensating for uncertainties, enhancing robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DRL assumes perfect action execution, ignoring real-world uncertainties like hardware constraints and latency, which degrade performance in applications like robotics and communication networks.

Method: The framework uses a two-stage process: determining desired actions and selecting control signals to ensure proper execution, training agents to account for mismatches and corrections.

Result: The approach improves robustness, optimizing actions for real-world uncertainties, and is validated in five mechanical simulation environments.

Conclusion: This framework bridges the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation, offering practical solutions for control-oriented applications.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex
decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often
assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations
between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In
real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication
networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware
constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work
advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that
explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge
largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured
two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate
control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting
for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these
factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action
with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,
explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,
ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.
Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by
bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It
equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the
ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances
during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source
mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect
real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against
uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for
control-oriented applications.

### [307] [Rethink 3D Object Detection from Physical World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00190)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Koji Minoda,Fumiya Watanabe,Takamasa Horibe*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces new metrics (L-AP and P-AP) for evaluating 3D object detection in autonomous driving, addressing the speed-accuracy trade-off and hardware impact, and optimizes models using these metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics (mAP and latency) fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, hardware impact, and collision avoidance in motion planning, which are critical for real-time autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP) metrics, evaluates models on the nuPlan dataset, and uses latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) for model optimization.

Result: Demonstrates the effectiveness of L-AP and P-AP, challenges the assumption that more point clouds improve performance, and optimizes hardware and model selection.

Conclusion: The new metrics provide a more comprehensive evaluation for real-time 3D object detection, improving system performance and safety in autonomous driving.

Abstract: High-accuracy and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous
driving systems. While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate
performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically
fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at
100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs
between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite
being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the
impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading
to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In
this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)
as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time
and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for
real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics
for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D
object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators.
We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object
detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our
metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the
more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for
real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our
metrics.

*Yi Ru Wang,Carter Ung,Grant Tannert,Jiafei Duan,Josephine Li,Amy Le,Rishabh Oswal,Markus Grotz,Wilbert Pumacay,Yuquan Deng,Ranjay Krishna,Dieter Fox,Siddhartha Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboEval is a benchmark and evaluation framework for bimanual manipulation policies, revealing hidden weaknesses beyond binary success metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks often mask critical policy flaws like poor coordination or grasping issues, limiting understanding of robotic manipulation.

Method: RoboEval uses tiered tasks with skill-specific stages, diagnostic metrics, and human demonstrations to systematically evaluate policies.

Result: Policies with similar success rates show divergent execution flaws, and behavioral metrics correlate with success in many cases.

Conclusion: RoboEval provides deeper insights into policy failures, advocating for evaluation tools beyond binary success.

Abstract: We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

*Reza Ahmadvand,Sarah Safura Sharif,Yaser Mike Banad*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A nature-inspired, collision-free formation control for multi-UAV systems is introduced, combining centralized guidance and distributed control for obstacle avoidance in 2D and 3D environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of multi-UAV systems in urban areas requires effective collision avoidance amidst static and dynamic obstacles, inspired by collective behaviors in nature.

Method: A semi-distributed control approach is used: centralized guidance for optimal UAV positioning (probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm) and distributed control for collision/obstacle avoidance, extended to 3D with novel maneuvers.

Result: The framework successfully avoids obstacles in dynamic 2D and 3D environments, validating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed method is viable for multi-UAV systems in complex, obstacle-filled environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a
rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which
are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired
by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the
presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free
formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed
control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a
centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while
a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and
obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the
3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented
framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the
obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic
environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A plug-and-play module enhances Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by implicitly adding 3D geometry features, improving spatial understanding without extra sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lack precise spatial understanding due to 2D training. Explicit 3D inputs require additional hardware or imperfect estimation.

Method: The proposed module leverages an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation model to inject 3D features into VLA models. Five spatially challenging tasks validate the approach.

Result: The method significantly boosts performance of state-of-the-art VLA models in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: The plug-and-play module effectively enhances VLA models' spatial understanding without needing extra sensors.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for
enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the
real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text
pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding
capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D
supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated
explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates
additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work
introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features
into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation
models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial
understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive
evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

*Tinghe Hong,Shenlin Cai,Boyang Li,Kai Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A new method combines machine learning and traditional algorithms for eye localization and tracking in ophthalmic surgery, improving precision and reducing reliance on manual navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current eye gaze estimation techniques in surgery face challenges like sensor dependence, occlusion, and facial detection requirements, limiting consistency and increasing uncertainty.

Method: Proposes a hybrid approach using machine learning and traditional algorithms for stable iris detection and gaze estimation without landmarks, adaptable to varying lighting.

Result: Achieves 0.58-degree average error in eye orientation estimation and 2.08-degree control error for robotic arm movement.

Conclusion: The method enhances surgical robot precision and reduces manual dependency, addressing key limitations in existing techniques.

Abstract: Ophthalmic surgical robots offer superior stability and precision by reducing
the natural hand tremors of human surgeons, enabling delicate operations in
confined surgical spaces. Despite the advancements in developing vision- and
force-based control methods for surgical robots, preoperative navigation
remains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting the consistency and
increasing the uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques in the
surgery, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges including
dependence on additional sensors, occlusion issues in surgical environments,
and the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this
study proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines
machine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the requirements of
landmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under
varying lighting and shadow conditions. Extensive real-world experiment results
show that our proposed method has an average estimation error of 0.58 degrees
for eye orientation estimation and 2.08-degree average control error for the
robotic arm's movement based on the calculated orientation.

TL;DR: RaGNNarok is a lightweight GNN-based framework for enhancing radar point clouds in indoor mobile robots, offering real-time performance and reliability in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lidar and camera solutions have limitations like poor performance in obscured environments and high costs, while radar sensors face issues like noise and sparse data.

Method: RaGNNarok uses a graph neural network to improve radar point clouds, achieving fast inference (7.3 ms) on low-cost devices like Raspberry Pi 5.

Result: The framework shows strong reliability and generalizability in localization, SLAM, and navigation tasks across diverse environments.

Conclusion: RaGNNarok is a robust, cost-effective solution for indoor mobile robots, addressing key challenges in radar-based localization.

Abstract: Low-cost indoor mobile robots have gained popularity with the increasing
adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

Motivation: Warehouse automation generates vast unannotated data, which can be leveraged to enhance perception models without costly manual labeling.

Method: Develops a correct-and-certify pipeline for self-supervised box pose and shape estimation, using real-world unlabeled data.

Result: Outperforms simulation-only models and zero-shot 3D bounding box estimation baselines, validated on 50,000 real-world images.

Conclusion: Self-supervised domain adaptation effectively improves perception models in industrial settings, reducing reliance on manual annotations.

Abstract: Modern warehouse automation systems rely on fleets of intelligent robots that
generate vast amounts of data -- most of which remains unannotated. This paper
develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages
real-world, unlabeled data to improve perception models without requiring
manual annotations. Our work focuses specifically on estimating the pose and
shape of boxes and presents a correct-and-certify pipeline for self-supervised
box pose and shape estimation. We extensively evaluate our approach across a
range of simulated and real industrial settings, including adaptation to a
large-scale real-world dataset of 50,000 images. The self-supervised model
significantly outperforms models trained solely in simulation and shows
substantial improvements over a zero-shot 3D bounding box estimation baseline.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RIGVid enables robots to perform complex tasks by imitating AI-generated videos, bypassing physical demonstrations. It uses video diffusion and vision-language models for filtering and 6D pose tracking for trajectory extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate the need for physical demonstrations or robot-specific training in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Combines video diffusion models for generating demonstrations, vision-language models for filtering, and 6D pose tracking for trajectory extraction.

Result: Generated videos are as effective as real demonstrations, with performance improving with video quality. Strong 6D pose tracking outperforms other trajectory extraction methods.

Conclusion: AI-generated videos can effectively supervise robotic manipulation, offering a scalable alternative to physical demonstrations.

Abstract: This work introduces Robots Imitating Generated Videos (RIGVid), a system
that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring,
wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring
any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language
command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential
demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters
out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts
object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the
robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world
evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real
demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also
show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives
such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking
outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point
tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art
off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic
manipulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An innovative vector quantization-based action tokenizer is introduced, leveraging a large-scale dataset to improve spatiotemporal dynamics and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of previous approaches by utilizing a significantly larger dataset for richer action dynamics and seamless adaptation to various tasks.

Method: The tokenizer is trained on a massive synthetic action trajectory dataset, enabling zero-shot adaptation to downstream tasks.

Result: Achieves up to 30% higher success rate in real-world tasks, demonstrating minimal domain gap between synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: The tokenizer is a scalable solution for real-time robotic control, enhancing efficiency and reliability across diverse applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an innovative vector quantization based action
tokenizer built upon the largest-scale action trajectory dataset to date,
leveraging over 100 times more data than previous approaches. This extensive
dataset enables our tokenizer to capture rich spatiotemporal dynamics,
resulting in a model that not only accelerates inference but also generates
smoother and more coherent action outputs. Once trained, the tokenizer can be
seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,
from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding
of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action
trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of
synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To
validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated
environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the
volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer
on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30%
higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and
scalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way
for more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PI-WAN combines physics and data-driven methods for robust quadrotor dynamics modeling, improving tracking in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modeling struggles in unknown environments, while data-driven methods fail with out-of-distribution data.

Method: PI-WAN uses a Temporal Convolutional Network with physics-informed loss for robust learning, integrated into MPC.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, tracking, and robustness in simulations and real-world tests.

Conclusion: PI-WAN effectively bridges knowledge and data-driven approaches for better quadrotor performance.

Abstract: Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise
trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical
knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown
environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and
external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer
from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data,
restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN),
which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding
physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor
dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from
historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical
principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously
unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model
predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop
tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack support for humanoid robots with dual arms and dexterous hands, making autonomous data collection for complex bimanual tasks challenging.

Method: The framework uses atomic dexterous operations, LLM reasoning for spatial constraints, and Monte Carlo tree search for long-horizon planning.

Result: A novel benchmark shows that 2D and 3D diffusion policies scale with the generated dataset.

Conclusion: HumanoidGen successfully addresses the gap in simulation tasks and demonstrations for humanoid robots, enhancing bimanual manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation
benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid
robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and
high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous
manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm
movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging.
This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration
collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM
reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial
annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations,
and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial
constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To
further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree
search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient
annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented
scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that
the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the
generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate photometric redshift estimation is crucial for cosmology, especially in large surveys where spectroscopy is impractical. Traditional methods have limitations, prompting the need for a hybrid approach.

Method: The hybrid method integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided neural networks, embedding spectral templates and employing multimodal design with cross-attention and Bayesian layers.

Result: Tested on the PREML dataset (400,000 galaxies), the model achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, 0.13% catastrophic outliers, and bias of 0.0028, meeting two LSST requirements for redshifts below 3.

Conclusion: Combining physical templates with data-driven models shows promise for robust redshift estimation in future surveys.

Abstract: Accurate photometric redshift estimation is critical for observational
cosmology, especially in large-scale surveys where spectroscopic measurements
are impractical. Traditional approaches include template fitting and machine
learning, each with distinct strengths and limitations. We present a hybrid
method that integrates template fitting with deep learning using physics-guided
neural networks. By embedding spectral energy distribution templates into the
network architecture, our model encodes physical priors into the training
process. The system employs a multimodal design, incorporating cross-attention
mechanisms to fuse photometric and image data, along with Bayesian layers for
uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our model on the publicly available PREML
dataset, which includes approximately 400,000 galaxies from the Hyper
Suprime-Cam PDR3 release, with 5-band photometry, multi-band imaging, and
spectroscopic redshifts. Our approach achieves an RMS error of 0.0507, a
3-sigma catastrophic outlier rate of 0.13%, and a bias of 0.0028. The model
satisfies two of the three LSST photometric redshift requirements for redshifts
below 3. These results highlight the potential of combining physically
motivated templates with data-driven models for robust redshift estimation in
upcoming cosmological surveys.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture combining blockchain and intelligent agents to ensure trustworthy tokenization of alternative assets, enhancing transparency, security, and compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in ensuring trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems, such as verifying off-chain asset data and regulatory compliance, motivate the need for a robust solution.

Method: An AI-governed agent architecture integrates autonomous agents for tokenization processes (verification, valuation, compliance) with an AI-driven governance layer for monitoring and enforcement.

Result: The approach improves transparency, security, and compliance, demonstrated through a real estate tokenization case study with real-time AI anomaly detection.

Conclusion: Combining AI governance, multi-agent systems, and blockchain significantly enhances trust in tokenized asset ecosystems, offering a novel framework for practitioners.

Abstract: Alternative Assets tokenization is transforming non-traditional financial
instruments are represented and traded on the web. However, ensuring
trustworthiness in web-based tokenized ecosystems poses significant challenges,
from verifying off-chain asset data to enforcing regulatory compliance. This
paper proposes an AI-governed agent architecture that integrates intelligent
agents with blockchain to achieve web-trustworthy tokenization of alternative
assets. In the proposed architecture, autonomous agents orchestrate the
tokenization process (asset verification, valuation, compliance checking, and
lifecycle management), while an AI-driven governance layer monitors agent
behavior and enforces trust through adaptive policies and cryptoeconomic
incentives. We demonstrate that this approach enhances transparency, security,
and compliance in asset tokenization, addressing key concerns around data
authenticity and fraud. A case study on tokenizing real estate assets
illustrates how the architecture mitigates risks (e.g., fraudulent listings and
money laundering) through real-time AI anomaly detection and on-chain
enforcement. Our evaluation and analysis suggest that combining AI governance
with multi-agent systems and blockchain can significantly bolster trust in
tokenized asset ecosystems. This work offers a novel framework for trustworthy
asset tokenization on the web and provides insights for practitioners aiming to
deploy secure, compliant tokenization platforms.

TL;DR: The paper provides a formal specification and proof for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) in Bitcoin, correcting misconceptions and proving its security and optimality for scalable digital cash systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misrepresentations of SPV in popular implementations and demonstrate its security and efficiency under adversarial conditions.

Method: Reconstructs SPV from first principles using symbolic automata, Merkle membership relations, and probabilistic/game-theoretic analysis.

Result: Proves SPV's security, liveness, and safety under partial connectivity and adversarial networks, with low-bandwidth optimizations.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a secure SPV implementation guide and corrects common misconceptions about non-validating clients.

Abstract: This paper presents a complete formal specification, protocol description,
and mathematical proof structure for Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) as
originally defined in the Bitcoin whitepaper \cite{nakamoto2008}. In stark
contrast to the misrepresentations proliferated by popular implementations, we
show that SPV is not only secure under bounded adversarial assumptions but
strictly optimal for digital cash systems requiring scalable and verifiable
transaction inclusion. We reconstruct the SPV protocol from first principles,
grounding its verification model in symbolic automata, Merkle membership
relations, and chain-of-proof dominance predicates. Through rigorous
probabilistic and game-theoretic analysis, we derive the economic bounds within
which the protocol operates securely and verify its liveness and safety
properties under partial connectivity, hostile relay networks, and adversarial
propagation delay. Our specification further introduces low-bandwidth
optimisations such as adaptive polling and compressed header synchronisation
while preserving correctness. This document serves both as a blueprint for
secure SPV implementation and a rebuttal of common misconceptions surrounding

### [321] [AI-Hybrid TRNG: Kernel-Based Deep Learning for Near-Uniform Entropy Harvesting from Physical Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00145)
*Hasan Yiğit*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a lightweight, deep-learning-based framework that generates high-entropy random numbers using low-cost hardware, eliminating the need for expensive quantum devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating high-quality random numbers without relying on bulky or expensive hardware.

Method: The method involves using a dynamic inner-outer network that couples adaptive natural sources (low-cost RF front end and CPU-timing jitter) and reseeding to produce unpredictable sequences.

Result: The generated numbers pass NIST SP 800-22 and 19 bespoke statistical tests, meeting cryptographic standards with no exploitable biases. The model is lightweight (<0.5 MB) and deployable on resource-constrained platforms.

Conclusion: AI-Hybrid TRNG offers a scalable and hardware-independent solution for high-integrity random number generation, suitable for secure systems, embedded devices, and more.

Abstract: AI-Hybrid TRNG is a deep-learning framework that extracts near-uniform
entropy directly from physical noise, eliminating the need for bulky quantum
devices or expensive laboratory-grade RF receivers. Instead, it relies on a
low-cost, thumb-sized RF front end, plus CPU-timing jitter, for training, and
then emits 32-bit high-entropy streams without any quantization step.
  Unlike deterministic or trained artificial intelligence random number
generators (RNGs), our dynamic inner-outer network couples adaptive natural
sources and reseeding, yielding truly unpredictable and autonomous sequences.
Generated numbers pass the NIST SP 800-22 battery better than a CPU-based
method. It also passes nineteen bespoke statistical tests for both bit- and
integer-level analysis. All results satisfy cryptographic standards, while
forward and backward prediction experiments reveal no exploitable biases. The
model's footprint is below 0.5 MB, making it deployable on MCUs and FPGA soft
cores, as well as suitable for other resource-constrained platforms.
  By detaching randomness quality from dedicated hardware, AI-Hybrid TRNG
broadens the reach of high-integrity random number generators across secure
systems, cryptographic protocols, embedded and edge devices, stochastic
simulations, and server applications that need randomness.

*Yinghao Wu,Liyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the vulnerability of Vision Mamba (ViM) to backdoor attacks, introducing BadViM, a novel attack framework using Resonant Frequency Triggers (RFT) and Hidden State Alignment loss, showing high success rates and resilience to defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the security risks of Vision Mamba models, which are underexplored despite their potential as alternatives to Vision Transformers.

Method: Proposes BadViM, a backdoor attack framework using RFT and Hidden State Alignment loss to manipulate model representations.

Result: BadViM achieves high attack success rates, maintains clean data accuracy, and resists common defenses like PatchDrop and JPEG compression.

Conclusion: ViM models are highly susceptible to stealthy backdoor attacks, highlighting the need for robust security measures in their deployment.

Abstract: Vision State Space Models (SSMs), particularly architectures like Vision
Mamba (ViM), have emerged as promising alternatives to Vision Transformers
(ViTs). However, the security implications of this novel architecture,
especially their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, remain critically
underexplored. Backdoor attacks aim to embed hidden triggers into victim
models, causing the model to misclassify inputs containing these triggers while
maintaining normal behavior on clean inputs. This paper investigates the
susceptibility of ViM to backdoor attacks by introducing BadViM, a novel
backdoor attack framework specifically designed for Vision Mamba. The proposed
BadViM leverages a Resonant Frequency Trigger (RFT) that exploits the frequency
sensitivity patterns of the victim model to create stealthy, distributed
triggers. To maximize attack efficacy, we propose a Hidden State Alignment loss
that strategically manipulates the internal representations of model by
aligning the hidden states of backdoor images with those of target classes.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadViM achieves superior attack
success rates while maintaining clean data accuracy. Meanwhile, BadViM exhibits
remarkable resilience against common defensive measures, including PatchDrop,
PatchShuffle and JPEG compression, which typically neutralize normal backdoor
attacks.

*Wenjin Mo,Zhiyuan Li,Minghong Fang,Mingwei Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FedPoisonMIA is a poisoning attack in federated learning (FL) that infers membership information, with a proposed defense mechanism to mitigate its impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL's distributed nature makes it vulnerable to poisoning attacks, but existing attacks focus on model integrity, not privacy. This study addresses privacy concerns in FL poisoning attacks.

Method: Introduces FedPoisonMIA, where malicious clients craft local model updates to infer membership information, and proposes a defense mechanism.

Result: Experiments show FedPoisonMIA's effectiveness, while the defense reduces its impact.

Conclusion: The study highlights privacy risks in FL poisoning attacks and offers a defense, though further improvements may be needed.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a
global machine learning model with coordination from a central server, without
needing to share their raw data. This approach is particularly appealing in the
era of privacy regulations like the GDPR, leading many prominent companies to
adopt it. However, FL's distributed nature makes it susceptible to poisoning
attacks, where malicious clients, controlled by an attacker, send harmful data
to compromise the model. Most existing poisoning attacks in FL aim to degrade
the model's integrity, such as reducing its accuracy, with limited attention to
privacy concerns from these attacks. In this study, we introduce FedPoisonMIA,
a novel poisoning membership inference attack targeting FL. FedPoisonMIA
involves malicious clients crafting local model updates to infer membership
information. Additionally, we propose a robust defense mechanism to mitigate
the impact of FedPoisonMIA attacks. Extensive experiments across various
datasets demonstrate the attack's effectiveness, while our defense approach
reduces its impact to a degree.

TL;DR: The paper proposes Sensorial Zero Trust, a framework to verify sensory information in the face of AI-generated deepfakes and cloned voices, integrating methods like Out-of-Band verification and VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of sophisticated AI-generated frauds necessitates doubting sensory information to mitigate risks and protect organizational integrity.

Method: The framework includes Out-of-Band verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), cryptographic provenance, and human training to extend Zero Trust principles to sensory data.

Result: Empirical findings support the need for rigorous verification protocols in an era where AI can deceive human senses.

Conclusion: Organizations must adopt methodological skepticism and Sensorial Zero Trust to counter AI-generated threats effectively.

Abstract: In a world where deepfakes and cloned voices are emerging as sophisticated
attack vectors, organizations require a new security mindset: Sensorial Zero
Trust [9]. This article presents a scientific analysis of the need to
systematically doubt information perceived through the senses, establishing
rigorous verification protocols to mitigate the risks of fraud based on
generative artificial intelligence. Key concepts, such as Out-of-Band
verification, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as forensic collaborators,
cryptographic provenance, and human training, are integrated into a framework
that extends Zero Trust principles to human sensory information. The approach
is grounded in empirical findings and academic research, emphasizing that in an
era of AI-generated realities, even our eyes and ears can no longer be
implicitly trusted without verification. Leaders are called to foster a culture
of methodological skepticism to protect organizational integrity in this new
threat landscape.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: VTS-AI integrates Visual Thinking Strategies into AI agents to extract business insights from unstructured reports, offering richer outputs than ChatGPT and enabling human-in-the-loop adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern firms struggle with dense, unstructured reports, requiring agile solutions for quick insights.

Method: VTS-AI uses a three-tier system (micro, meso, macro) to tag issues, link them to source pages, and store actionable insights in a searchable YAML file.

Result: In tests, VTS-AI matched ChatGPT's speed but provided richer outputs like page locations, excerpts, severity scores, and causal links.

Conclusion: VTS-AI shows promise for rapid business analysis, with future upgrades planned for production readiness and audit-friendliness.

Abstract: Modern firms face a flood of dense, unstructured reports. Turning these
documents into usable insights takes heavy effort and is far from agile when
quick answers are needed. VTS-AI tackles this gap. It integrates Visual
Thinking Strategies, which emphasize evidence-based observation, linking, and
thinking, into AI agents, so the agents can extract business insights from
unstructured text, tables, and images at scale. The system works in three tiers
(micro, meso, macro). It tags issues, links them to source pages, and rolls
them into clear action levers stored in a searchable YAML file. In tests on an
18-page business report, VTS-AI matched the speed of a one-shot ChatGPT prompt
yet produced richer findings: page locations, verbatim excerpts, severity
scores, and causal links. Analysts can accept or adjust these outputs in the
same IDE, keeping human judgment in the loop. Early results show VTS-AI spots
the direction of key metrics and flags where deeper number-crunching is needed.
Next steps include mapping narrative tags to financial ratios, adding
finance-tuned language models through a Model-Context Protocol, and building a
Risk & Safety Layer to stress-test models and secure data. These upgrades aim
to make VTS-AI a production-ready, audit-friendly tool for rapid business
analysis.

*Abanoub E. Abdelmalak,Mohamed A. Elsayed,David Abercrombie,Ilhami Torunoglu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel methodology combining AST embedding and RAG for SVRF code synthesis, improving accuracy by 40% over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in SVRF development due to complex design rules and expertise gaps in semiconductor applications like DRC, LVS, and OPC.

Method: Integrates AST for structural validation and RAG for domain knowledge, evaluated with T5-based models and a custom SVRF scoring framework.

Result: 40% improvement in code generation accuracy on 740 DRC rule benchmarks, reducing manual errors and enhancing productivity.

Conclusion: The methodology optimizes SVRF development, enabling faster design cycles and improved efficiency in semiconductor applications.

Abstract: Standard Verification Rule Format (SVRF) is essential for semiconductor
applications like Design Rule Check (DRC), Layout Versus Schematic (LVS), and
Optical Proximity Correction (OPC) and it faces challenges as advancing nodes
create complex design rules that renders traditional SVRF development
ineffective and highlight an expertise gap. This paper introduces a novel
methodology integrating Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced SVRF code synthesis, ensuring
semantic accuracy and error minimization through structural validation with
domain-specific insights for precise code generation.
  We evaluate different T5-based models and propose an innovative SVRF-specific
scoring framework that complements standard metrics like BLEU and ROUGE-L. In
our approach, AST provides rigorous structural validation, while RAG infuses
relevant domain knowledge, effectively enhancing the code generation workflow.
  Testing on a comprehensive benchmark of 740 DRC rule implementations, our
methodology demonstrates up to a 40\% improvement in code generation accuracy
compared to basic text-based fine-tuning process. This fusion of industry
expertise with advanced coding strategies not only optimizes SVRF development
under limited dataset constraints but also creates a more intuitive and
efficient coding environment. Consequently, users can rapidly iterate through
design cycles, reduce manual error correction, and significantly improve
overall productivity.

*Xikai Sun,Fan Dang,Kebin Liu,Xin Miao,Zihao Yang,Haimo Lu,Yawen Zheng,Yunhao Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: iPanda is an end-to-end framework using LLMs to automate protocol conformance testing, improving efficiency and accuracy over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional protocol conformance testing is labor-intensive and inefficient, while LLMs offer automation potential.

Method: iPanda uses keyword-based test case generation, code-based retrieval-augmented generation, and iterative self-correction to produce executable test scripts.

Result: iPanda outperforms pure LLM-based approaches, improving test-code generation success rates by 4.675x to 10.751x.

Conclusion: iPanda effectively automates and enhances protocol conformance testing using LLMs.

Abstract: Conformance testing is essential for ensuring that protocol implementations
comply with their specifications. However, traditional testing approaches
involve manually creating numerous test cases and scripts, making the process
labor-intensive and inefficient. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive text comprehension and code generation abilities,
providing promising opportunities for automation. In this paper, we propose
iPanda, the first end-to-end framework that leverages LLMs to automate protocol
conformance testing. Given a protocol specification document and its
implementation, iPanda first employs a keyword-based method to automatically
generate comprehensive test cases. Then, it utilizes a code-based
retrieval-augmented generation approach to effectively interpret the
implementation and produce executable test code. To further enhance code
quality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine
generated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the
generated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between
implementations and protocol specifications. Comprehensive experiments on
various protocols show that iPanda significantly outperforms pure LLM-based
approaches, improving the success rate (Pass@1) of test-code generation by
factors ranging from 4.675 times to 10.751 times.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AI assistants improve development speed and maintainability, with habitual users seeing the most benefits, but risks like code bloat and cognitive debt need further study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of AI-assisted co-development on software maintainability, focusing on how easily other developers can evolve the resulting code.

Method: A two-phase controlled experiment with 151 participants (95% professionals). Phase 1 involved adding a feature with/without AI; Phase 2 evolved these solutions without AI.

Result: AI-assisted development led to modest speedups and slightly higher CodeHealth, significant for habitual users. Productivity improved by 30.7% (median) and 55.9% (mean for habitual users).

Conclusion: AI assistants accelerate development without degrading maintainability, but future research should address risks like code bloat and cognitive debt.

Abstract: [Context] AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are transforming
software engineering. While several studies highlight productivity
improvements, their impact on maintainability requires further investigation.
[Objective] This study investigates whether co-development with AI assistants
affects software maintainability, specifically how easily other developers can
evolve the resulting source code. [Method] We conducted a two-phase controlled
experiment involving 151 participants, 95% of whom were professional
developers. In Phase 1, participants added a new feature to a Java web
application, with or without AI assistance. In Phase 2, a randomized controlled
trial, new participants evolved these solutions without AI assistance.
[Results] AI-assisted development in Phase 1 led to a modest speedup in
subsequent evolution and slightly higher average CodeHealth. Although neither
difference was significant overall, the increase in CodeHealth was
statistically significant when habitual AI users completed Phase 1. For Phase
1, we also observed a significant effect that corroborates previous
productivity findings: using an AI assistant yielded a 30.7% median decrease in
task completion time. Moreover, for habitual AI users, the mean speedup was
55.9%. [Conclusions] Our study adds to the growing evidence that AI assistants
can effectively accelerate development. Moreover, we did not observe warning
signs of degraded code-level maintainability. We recommend that future research
focus on risks such as code bloat from excessive code generation and the
build-up of cognitive debt as developers invest less mental effort during
implementation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces σ-MAGs, an extension of MAGs, to represent cyclic causal relationships in directed graphs with latent variables, addressing a key limitation of MAGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAGs cannot represent cyclic causal relationships, limiting their applicability. The paper aims to overcome this by introducing σ-MAGs.

Method: The authors define σ-MAGs, study their properties, and characterize their Markov equivalence classes.

Result: σ-MAGs successfully represent cyclic causal relationships in directed graphs with latent variables, extending the utility of MAGs.

Conclusion: σ-MAGs provide a robust framework for modeling cyclic causal relationships, broadening the scope of causal discovery methods.

Abstract: Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAGs) provide an abstract representation of
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with latent (selection) variables. These
graphical objects encode information about ancestral relations and
d-separations of the DAGs they represent. This abstract representation has been
used amongst others to prove the soundness and completeness of the FCI
algorithm for causal discovery, and to derive a do-calculus for its output. One
significant inherent limitation of MAGs is that they rule out the possibility
of cyclic causal relationships. In this work, we address that limitation. We
introduce and study a class of graphical objects that we coin
''$\sigma$-Maximal Ancestral Graphs'' (''$\sigma$-MAGs''). We show how these
graphs provide an abstract representation of (possibly cyclic) Directed Graphs
(DGs) with latent (selection) variables, analogously to how MAGs represent
DAGs. We study the properties of these objects and provide a characterization
of their Markov equivalence classes.

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for understanding the generalization abilities of narrow neural networks, highlighting a transition where neurons specialize with sufficient data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks with generic activation functions, addressing gaps in existing literature.

Method: Uses statistical physics methods to derive closed-form expressions for network performance, focusing on narrow networks (large hidden units but smaller than input dimension). Analyzes Bayesian and empirical risk minimization estimators.

Result: The theory accurately predicts generalization error for networks trained on regression or classification tasks, identifying a transition point where neurons specialize with enough data.

Conclusion: The work offers a general theory for narrow networks, validated by empirical results, and highlights key transitions in neuron behavior with increasing data.

Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple
input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance
on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is
trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves
as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical
account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the
presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop
such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of
hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from
statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical
performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk
minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In
doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons
specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to
the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the
generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification
tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or
full-batch gradient descent.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'incoherence,' a measure to quantify incorrectness in LLM-generated code without needing an oracle, showing strong alignment with oracle-based evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce factually incorrect code despite grammatical correctness, and there's a need to quantify this without relying on existing correct implementations.

Method: Proposes 'incoherence,' an efficient measure to estimate incorrectness, providing a lower bound on error probability for LLM-generated programs.

Result: The method identifies ~66% of incorrect programs without false positives and aligns strongly with oracle-based rankings (pass@1).

Conclusion: Incoherence-based evaluation reliably replaces oracle-based evaluation for ranking LLMs in code generation tasks.

Abstract: Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most
successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate:
LLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually
incorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can
we quantify how likely the generated program is correct?
  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence,
that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a
lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program
for that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an
extraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our
incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of
incorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based
evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation.
In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by
the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of
LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.

TL;DR: GEM is a unified generative model for subsurface analysis, enabling zero-shot generalization across diverse tasks using prompts without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragmentation in subsurface analysis by unifying structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, and other tasks into a single model.

Method: GEM uses a two-stage training process: self-supervised learning on seismic data and adversarial fine-tuning with mixed prompts and labels.

Result: GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks like Martian radar stratigraphy, seismic interpretation, and geobody delineation.

Conclusion: GEM integrates expert knowledge with generative reasoning, offering a scalable, human-in-the-loop AI system for geophysical tasks.

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural
hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains
fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation,
stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each
tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We
introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative
architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference
along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This
formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference
mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs,
masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce
geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot
generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining
for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage
training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on
large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts
and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad
applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy
analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic
stratigraphic interpretation, geobody delineation, and property modeling. By
bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware
manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical
AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated,

TL;DR: Stochastic methods like Normalizing Flows and Rectified Flows outperform deterministic baselines in generating expressive prosody for text-to-speech, matching human variability and offering controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating expressive prosody in text-to-speech systems is challenging, especially for interpretable and controllable models using explicit parameters like pitch and energy.

Method: The study evaluates stochastic methods (Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, Rectified Flows) against deterministic baselines and human prosody.

Result: Stochastic methods produce prosody as natural as humans, capturing speech variability, and allow controllability via sampling temperature.

Conclusion: Stochastic methods are effective for prosody generation, matching human performance and enhancing controllability.

Abstract: While generative methods have progressed rapidly in recent years, generating
expressive prosody for an utterance remains a challenging task in
text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly true for systems that model
prosody explicitly through parameters such as pitch, energy, and duration,
which is commonly done for the sake of interpretability and controllability. In
this work, we investigate the effectiveness of stochastic methods for this
task, including Normalizing Flows, Conditional Flow Matching, and Rectified
Flows. We compare these methods to a traditional deterministic baseline, as
well as to real human realizations. Our extensive subjective and objective
evaluations demonstrate that stochastic methods produce natural prosody on par
with human speakers by capturing the variability inherent in human speech.
Further, they open up additional controllability options by allowing the
sampling temperature to be tuned.

TL;DR: A co-design framework optimizes analog front-end (AFE) and backend classifier jointly for audio signal classification, improving accuracy and reducing power/area.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Separate design of AFE and classifiers is suboptimal; joint optimization can enhance system performance.

Method: Jointly tune AFE's transfer function and classifier using an SNR-aware training loop and co-design loss function.

Result: Achieves 90.5%-94.2% accuracy for keyword classification, with 8.7% power and 12.9% capacitor area reduction.

Conclusion: Co-design framework outperforms conventional methods in accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable
analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification. Designing AFE and
backend classifiers separately is a common practice but non-ideal, as shown in
this paper. Instead, this paper proposes a joint optimization of the backend
classifier with the AFE's transfer function to achieve system-level optimum.
More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass
filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training
loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows
superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented
in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved
90.5%-94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of
input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters.

### [337] [Guided Unconditional and Conditional Generative Models for Super-Resolution and Inference of Quasi-Geostrophic Turbulence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00719)
*Anantha Narayanan Suresh Babu,Akhil Sadam,Pierre F. J. Lermusiaux*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four generative diffusion models for super-resolution and inference in 2D quasi-geostrophic turbulence, comparing their performance on coarse, sparse, and gappy observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical simulations of ocean, weather, and climate are often coarse, and observations are sparse, necessitating improved methods for super-resolution and inference.

Method: Four approaches are tested: two guided (SDEdit, DPS) and two conditional (vanilla variant, classifier-free guidance), evaluated across eight test cases with varying turbulence regimes, Reynolds numbers, and observation types.

Result: SDEdit produces unphysical fields, while DPS offers reasonable reconstructions but lacks fine-scale detail. Conditional approaches reconstruct fine-scale features and align with observations and statistics.

Conclusion: The study highlights trade-offs between implementation ease, fidelity, and cycle-consistency, providing practical guidance for geophysical inverse problems.

Abstract: Typically, numerical simulations of the ocean, weather, and climate are
coarse, and observations are sparse and gappy. In this work, we apply four
generative diffusion modeling approaches to super-resolution and inference of
forced two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic turbulence on the beta-plane from
coarse, sparse, and gappy observations. Two guided approaches minimally adapt a
pre-trained unconditional model: SDEdit modifies the initial condition, and
Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) modifies the reverse diffusion process
score. The other two conditional approaches, a vanilla variant and
classifier-free guidance, require training with paired high-resolution and
observation data. We consider eight test cases spanning: two regimes, eddy and
anisotropic-jet turbulence; two Reynolds numbers, 10^3 and 10^4; and two
observation types, 4x coarse-resolution fields and coarse, sparse and gappy
observations. Our comprehensive skill metrics include norms of the
reconstructed vorticity fields, turbulence statistical quantities, and
quantification of the super-resolved probabilistic ensembles and their errors.
We also study the sensitivity to tuning parameters such as guidance strength.
Results show that SDEdit generates unphysical fields, while DPS generates
reasonable reconstructions at low computational cost but with smoothed
fine-scale features. Both conditional approaches require re-training, but they
reconstruct missing fine-scale features, are cycle-consistent with
observations, and possess the correct statistics such as energy spectra.
Further, their mean model errors are highly correlated with and predictable
from their ensemble standard deviations. Results highlight the trade-offs
between ease of implementation, fidelity (sharpness), and cycle-consistency of
the diffusion models, and offer practical guidance for deployment in
geophysical inverse problems.

### [338] [How large language models judge and influence human cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00088)
*Alexandre S. Pires,Laurens Samson,Sennay Ghebreab,Fernando P. Santos*

Main category: physics.soc-ph

TL;DR: The paper examines how LLMs influence human cooperation by analyzing their judgments of cooperative actions and simulating long-term social dynamics. It reveals model variances in judgments and suggests interventions to align LLM norms for preserving cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the long-term impact of LLM-based social decision-making on human cooperation, driven by indirect reciprocity and reputations.

Method: Evaluated 21 LLMs' judgments on cooperative actions in various social contexts and simulated cooperation dynamics using an evolutionary game-theoretical model.

Result: LLMs agree on judging cooperation with good opponents but vary in judgments for ill-reputed individuals, impacting cooperation prevalence. Prompt interventions can steer LLM norms.

Conclusion: LLM norms must be carefully aligned to preserve human cooperation, highlighting the need for responsible AI integration in social decision-making.

Abstract: Humans increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to support decisions
in social settings. Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral
and political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based
social decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected
when the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a
pressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect
reciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.
Here, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide
21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate
-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these
interactions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary
game-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where
the extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of
LLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating
cooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and
between-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.
We show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact
the prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,
showing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through
goal-oriented prompts. Our research connects LLM-based advices and long-term
social dynamics, and highlights the need to carefully align LLM norms in order
to preserve human cooperation.

*Ke Liu,Shuanke Shen,Hao Chen*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting NLP language models to biological sequences, emphasizing structural correlations and proposing a method to integrate 3D biomolecular structure into the modeling process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between NLP successes and biological sequence modeling by addressing fundamental differences in structural correlations between natural and biological languages.

Method: Treats 3D biomolecular structure as semantic content and incorporates residue/base correlations, using an auto-regressive paradigm for modeling.

Result: Demonstrates the applicability of auto-regressive modeling in biological language and underscores the importance of structural evaluation.

Conclusion: Effective translation of NLP techniques to biological domains requires accounting for structural differences, with promising results shown in the proposed approach.

Abstract: The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP)
has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins,
RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation
metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling.
However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological
languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in
biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively
translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules
as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong
correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of
structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive
paradigm in biological language modeling. Code can be found at

TL;DR: Proposes a transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in MIDI, outperforming existing symbolic methods with novel preprocessing and competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing beat tracking methods focus on audio, leaving a gap for symbolic MIDI performance analysis.

Method: End-to-end transformer model with encoder-decoder architecture, dynamic augmentation, and optimized tokenization.

Result: Outperforms HMMs and deep learning methods, achieving high F1-scores across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights transformer potential for symbolic beat tracking and suggests integration with music transcription systems.

Abstract: Beat tracking in musical performance MIDI is a challenging and important task
for notation-level music transcription and rhythmical analysis, yet existing
methods primarily focus on audio-based approaches. This paper proposes an
end-to-end transformer-based model for beat and downbeat tracking in
performance MIDI, leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture for
sequence-to-sequence translation of MIDI input to beat annotations. Our
approach introduces novel data preprocessing techniques, including dynamic
augmentation and optimized tokenization strategies, to improve accuracy and
generalizability across different datasets. We conduct extensive experiments
using the A-MAPS, ASAP, GuitarSet, and Leduc datasets, comparing our model
against state-of-the-art hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning-based
beat tracking methods. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing symbolic music beat tracking approaches, achieving competitive
F1-scores across various musical styles and instruments. Our findings highlight
the potential of transformer architectures for symbolic beat tracking and
suggest future integration with automatic music transcription systems for
enhanced music analysis and score generation.

Motivation: Early identification of suicide risk is critical, and speech offers an accessible mental health indicator.

Method: Combines large language models (LLMs) with acoustic and semantic features for analysis.

Result: Achieved 74% accuracy on the test set, ranking first in the SW1 challenge.

Conclusion: LLM-based methods show promise for suicide risk assessment through speech analysis.

Abstract: Early identification of suicide risk is crucial for preventing suicidal

*Hiroki Kanagawa,Kenichi Fujita,Aya Watanabe,Yusuke Ijima*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A TTS method with multi-step interaction is proposed to enable iterative refinement of synthesized speech, mimicking the feedback process between voice actors and directors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS lacks fine-grained style refinement post-synthesis, often deviating from user intent.

Method: Models interaction between TTS and users, emulating voice actor-director feedback.

Result: Enables iterative style refinements based on user directions, demonstrating multi-interaction capability.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully integrates iterative feedback into TTS, improving alignment with user intent.

Abstract: Voice directors often iteratively refine voice actors' performances by
providing feedback to achieve the desired outcome. While this iterative
feedback-based refinement process is important in actual recordings, it has
been overlooked in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). As a result, fine-grained
style refinement after the initial synthesis is not possible, even though the
synthesized speech often deviates from the user's intended style. To address
this issue, we propose a TTS method with multi-step interaction that allows
users to intuitively and rapidly refine synthetized speech. Our approach models
the interaction between the TTS model and its user to emulate the relationship
between voice actors and voice directors. Experiments show that the proposed
model with its corresponding dataset enable iterative style refinements in
accordance with users' directions, thus demonstrating its multi-interaction
capability. Sample audios are available: https://ntt-hilab-gensp.

TL;DR: CTFT-Net is a novel SSR method that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex domains, outperforming existing models in extreme upsampling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent research emphasizes phase reconstruction's role in perceptual quality, motivating the development of CTFT-Net for comprehensive SSR.

Method: CTFT-Net uses complex global attention and conformer blocks to model dependencies and features, with time-domain and multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions.

Result: CTFT-Net excels in extreme upsampling (2 kHz to 48 kHz), outperforming NU-Wave, WSRGlow, NVSR, and AERO on the VCTK dataset.

Conclusion: CTFT-Net effectively reconstructs high frequencies without noisy artifacts, setting a new benchmark for SSR tasks.

Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SSR) enhances low-resolution speech by increasing
the sampling rate. While most SSR methods focus on magnitude reconstruction,
recent research highlights the importance of phase reconstruction for improved
perceptual quality. Therefore, we introduce CTFT-Net, a Complex Time-Frequency
Transformation Network that reconstructs both magnitude and phase in complex
domains for improved SSR tasks. It incorporates a complex global attention
block to model inter-phoneme and inter-frequency dependencies and a complex
conformer to capture long-range and local features, improving frequency
reconstruction and noise robustness. CTFT-Net employs time-domain and
multi-resolution frequency-domain loss functions for better generalization.
Experiments show CTFT-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models (NU-Wave,
WSRGlow, NVSR, AERO) on the VCTK dataset, particularly for extreme upsampling
(2 kHz to 48 kHz), reconstructing high frequencies effectively without noisy
artifacts.

### [344] [MuteSwap: Silent Face-based Voice Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00498)
*Yifan Liu,Yu Fang,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MuteSwap enables voice conversion from silent videos using visual inputs, outperforming audio-dependent methods in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice conversion typically requires clean audio from both source and target speakers, which is unavailable in silent videos or noisy environments. This work addresses the challenge of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC) using only visual cues.

Method: The proposed MuteSwap framework uses contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimizes mutual information to separate shared visual features.

Result: MuteSwap achieves strong performance in speech synthesis and identity conversion, particularly in noisy conditions where audio-dependent methods fail.

Conclusion: MuteSwap demonstrates the feasibility of SFVC and the effectiveness of its training approach, offering a robust solution for scenarios lacking clean audio.

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source
speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However,
this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in
silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of
Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely
from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video
of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the
identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the
source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and
converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To
address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive
learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to
separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap
achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity
conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio
input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the
effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

*Nikolai Lund Kühne,Jesper Jensen,Jan Østergaard,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces MambAttention, a hybrid model combining Mamba and shared time-frequency attention modules, for single-channel speech enhancement. It outperforms existing models on out-of-domain datasets while matching performance on in-domain data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sequence models like Mamba and LSTM overfit to training data. Hybrid models with self-attention improve generalization, but Mamba-attention hybrids remain unexplored for speech enhancement.

Method: Proposes MambAttention, integrating Mamba with shared time- and frequency-multi-head attention. Uses VB-DemandEx dataset for training and evaluates on DNS 2020 and EARS-WHAM_v2.

Result: MambAttention outperforms LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based models on out-of-domain datasets and matches performance on in-domain data. Ablation studies confirm the importance of weight sharing in attention modules.

Conclusion: MambAttention is superior for speech enhancement, especially on out-of-domain datasets. Shared attention modules also improve LSTM and xLSTM performance, though MambAttention remains the best.

Abstract: With the advent of new sequence models like Mamba and xLSTM, several studies
have shown that these models match or outperform state-of-the-art models in
single-channel speech enhancement, automatic speech recognition, and
self-supervised audio representation learning. However, prior research has
demonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the
training set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding
self-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for
single-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid
Mamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance
have been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech
enhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended
(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging
noise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our
proposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar
complexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020
and EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset
VB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the
time- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization
performance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and
frequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a
notable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our
MambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all
reported evaluation metrics.

Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling
precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite
the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant
gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for
robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible

robust guidewire tip tracking. This design handles visual ambiguities, tissue
deformations, and imaging artifacts through enhanced spatial-temporal feature
learning. Validation occurred on 3 randomly selected clinical digital

TL;DR: Proposes Med-LSDM, a 3D semantic diffusion model for generating synthetic medical images to address data scarcity and privacy issues, outperforming 2D methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming data scarcity and privacy challenges in medical imaging by generating synthetic 3D data.

Method: Uses a latent space diffusion model with a pre-trained VQ-GAN to generate 3D semantic images, reducing computational complexity.

Result: Achieves 3D-FID score of 0.0054 and Dice scores close to real images (0.70964 vs. 0.71496).

Conclusion: Med-LSDM effectively bridges the domain gap between synthetic and real data, proving useful for data augmentation.

Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both
accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data
availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine
learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM
(Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and
leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of
privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that
focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D
semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full
volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D
image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space
of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model
significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical
3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic
medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional
Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images
(0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model
have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.

TL;DR: A novel method for estimating fetal birth weight (FBW) from 3D fetal ultrasound volumes using multi-scale feature fusion and synthetic sample-based learning, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FBW estimation methods are inefficient, operator-dependent, and lack accuracy due to reliance on 2D images. Addressing these limitations is crucial for better delivery decisions and reduced perinatal mortality.

Method: Proposes a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) with channel and spatial attention, and a synthetic sample-based learning framework (SSLF) for semi-supervised learning using combined fetal head and abdomen data.

Result: Achieves a mean absolute error of 166.4±155.9 g and a mean absolute percentage error of 5.1±4.6%, surpassing existing methods and nearing senior doctor accuracy.

Conclusion: The method significantly improves FBW estimation accuracy, offering a robust solution for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation is essential for optimizing
delivery decisions and reducing perinatal mortality. However, clinical methods
for FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to
apply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are
based on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial
information, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the
first method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach
integrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic
sample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses
multi-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel
attention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates
synthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from
different fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean
absolute percentage error of $5.1\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and
approaching the accuracy of a senior doctor. Code is available at:

### [352] [Bridging Classical and Learning-based Iterative Registration through Deep Equilibrium Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00582)
*Yi Zhang,Yidong Zhao,Qian Tao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DEQReg introduces a Deep Equilibrium Model for medical image registration, addressing memory and convergence issues of traditional unrolling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning-based unrolling methods lack convergence guarantees and have high GPU memory usage. DEQReg aims to solve these issues.

Method: DEQReg formulates registration as an equilibrium-seeking problem, using Deep Equilibrium Models to enable unlimited iteration steps with constant memory.

Result: DEQReg achieves competitive performance on brain MRI and lung CT datasets, reducing memory usage and ensuring stable convergence.

Conclusion: DEQReg bridges classical optimization and learning-based methods, offering a stable and memory-efficient solution for deformable image registration.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an
optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively,
recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic
this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed
number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient
iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence
guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have
a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with
the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both
theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration
framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration
as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between
classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains
constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps.
Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we
show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while
substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art
unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of
existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly
when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast,
DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking
mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern
learning-based registration methods.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MTCNet, a semi-supervised learning model, improves 4D mitral valve ultrasound segmentation by leveraging motion and topology consistency, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 4D mitral valve analysis lack inter-phase dependency and struggle with limited annotations and artifacts.

Method: MTCNet uses cross-phase motion-guided consistency and topology-guided regularization for accurate segmentation with sparse annotations.

Result: MTCNet achieves superior performance (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm) on a large 4D MV dataset.

Conclusion: MTCNet effectively addresses challenges in 4D MV analysis, offering improved accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at
https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.

*Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Christian Schlarmann,Thomas Küstner,Christian F. Baumgartner,Matthias Hein*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Semantically Diverse Reconstructions (SDR) to address false negatives in deep learning-based MRI reconstructions by enhancing semantic variability while maintaining data consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MRI reconstruction methods may miss small or rare pathologies, leading to false-negative diagnoses. The goal is to ensure clinically relevant information is preserved.

Method: Proposes SDR, a technique to generate diverse reconstructions from undersampled data, validated using an object detector on the fastMRI+ dataset.

Result: SDR reduces false negatives (higher recall) and improves mean average precision compared to original reconstructions.

Conclusion: SDR enhances diagnostic reliability by preserving critical clinical information in accelerated MRI reconstructions.

Abstract: In recent years, accelerated MRI reconstruction based on deep learning has
led to significant improvements in image quality with impressive results for
high acceleration factors. However, from a clinical perspective image quality
is only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant
information is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data.
In this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering
resampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small
and rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions
(false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we
propose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\SDR), a method which, given
an original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced
semantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured
data. To evaluate \SDR automatically we train an object detector on the
fastMRI+ dataset. We show that \SDR significantly reduces the chance of
false-negative diagnoses (higher recall) and improves mean average precision
compared to the original reconstructions. The code is available on

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for prompt-based multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation in Chest X-rays, using expert-generated doodle prompts and multi-stage feature fusion for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional segmentation models are limited to specific organs or diseases, lacking flexibility. Prompt-based methods offer adaptability, but no dedicated work exists for Chest X-rays.

Method: The model uses expert-generated doodle prompts and multi-stage feature fusion to combine features from different network layers for better segmentation.

Result: Prompt2SegCXR outperforms existing pre-trained models for prompt-based segmentation, providing reliable results for Chest X-rays.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the gap in prompt-based multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation for Chest X-rays, offering a flexible and accurate solution.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field by isolating
organs or regions of interest from surrounding areas. Traditionally,
segmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting
their ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced
models can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater
flexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained
attention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based
on user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated
work on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation,
especially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first,
generating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from
multiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases,
specifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we
introduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple
organs and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage
feature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for
better spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy.
Compared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation,
our model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest
X-rays based on user prompts.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning model using ResNet18 and tunable wavelet units achieved higher accuracy than human graders in classifying ERM removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve clinical decision-making by accurately classifying the type of surgery (ILM removal or ERM-alone removal) performed for ERM removal using postoperative OCT scans.

Method: Developed a ResNet18 CNN model with tunable wavelet units (OrthLatt-UwU and PR-Relax-UwU) for preprocessing and feature enhancement, evaluated on original and preprocessed OCT scans.

Result: Achieved 78% accuracy with PR-Relax-UwU, outperforming human graders (50% accuracy). Preprocessing improved model performance (72% vs. 66% on original scans).

Conclusion: The CNN model with tunable wavelets shows promise for enhancing clinical decision-making in ERM surgery classification, surpassing human performance.

Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type
of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal
limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the
ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes
postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We
evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with
energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed
inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further
improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations:
Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect
Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units
allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training
and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling
layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and
ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU
increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model
outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in
classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These
findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical
decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for
classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.

TL;DR: Proposes YOLO-KFG, an improved YOLOv8n model, for diabetic retinopathy detection, enhancing accuracy and robustness with dynamic convolution, feature diffusion, and lightweight design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of diabetic retinopathy is challenging due to subtle micro-lesions and background interference, requiring more accurate and robust methods.

Method: Introduces KWConv and C2f-KW modules for better micro-lesion perception, FDPN for multi-scale context integration, and GSDHead for lightweight deployment.

Result: Reduces parameters by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves recall by 7.9% over YOLOv8n, outperforming YOLOv5n and YOLOv10n.

Conclusion: YOLO-KFG offers superior accuracy and efficiency for diabetic retinopathy detection, suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is one of the current
research focuses in ophthalmology. However, due to the subtle features of
micro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting
detection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and
robustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection
model based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a
new dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the
backbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions.
Secondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to
fully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's
ability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head
GSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more
deployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that
compared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter
count by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by
7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection
accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid anatomy-based post-processing method reduces false positives in DL models for intracranial aneurysm detection without losing true positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High false positive rates in DL models for aneurysm detection hinder clinical use, despite architectural improvements.

Method: Used two DL models (CPM-Net and 3D-CNN-TR) with anatomy-based segmentation masks to filter false positives.

Result: Method 5 reduced FPs by 70.6% (CPM-Net) and 51.6% (3D-CNN-TR) without affecting true positives.

Conclusion: Anatomy-based post-processing enhances DL model performance, suggesting hybrid heuristic-learning methods can improve clinical acceptance.

Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial
aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to
clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies
like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based,
heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to
further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D
convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with
1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143
held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and
cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible
FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3)
vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more
than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79
false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were
commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%;
3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular
(CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing
CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without
reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from
1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable
post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More
broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds
promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm
detection models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inter-observer variability in manual delineation and oversimplification of myocardial complexity in traditional parametric tissue mapping.

Method: Used deep learning for segmentation and machine learning (random forest) with multiple statistical features (mean, quartiles) for classification. Performance metrics included DICE, Bland-Altman plots, and F1-score.

Result: DL achieved 85.4% DICE, surpassing inter-observer agreement. Random forest improved F1-score to 92.7%.

Conclusion: DL enhances T1/T2 map segmentation, and ML with multiple features boosts disease detection accuracy.

Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue
characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual
delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and
single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates
whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to
inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond
mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining
multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2
maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by
two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was
trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower
quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the
myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.
Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated
segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and
model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined
optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual
segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification
performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,
with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were
split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.
Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer
agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <
0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining
multiple features with ML improves disease detection.

TL;DR: DMCIE, a diffusion model framework, improves brain tumor segmentation in MRI scans by using error maps and multimodal inputs, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor segmentation in MRI is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. Diffusion models show promise for such tasks.

Method: DMCIE uses a 3D U-Net for initial segmentation, generates an error map, and guides a diffusion model with concatenated inputs and errors.

Result: DMCIE achieves a Dice Score of 93.46 and HD95 of 5.94 mm on BraTS2020, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: Error-guided diffusion models like DMCIE enhance segmentation accuracy, proving effective for brain tumor analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable
clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models
have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation
tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based
on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of
Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in
multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation
mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences
between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with
the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal
MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation
accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs.
Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art
diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an
HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided
diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged scanning and motion artifacts in conventional MOLLI methods challenge patients with poor breathholds, and existing deep-learning approaches lack physics constraints.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework with Physics-Informed Neural ODEs, using a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model for sparse data acquisition.

Result: Achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from fewer images, outperforming data-driven priors in native and post-contrast sequences.

Conclusion: The physics-based approach enhances interpretability, generalization, and efficiency in cardiac parametric mapping.

Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac
parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing
cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI)
acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure
mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients
with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image
quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a
signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies
have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened
sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless,
existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting
interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated,
end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these
challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse
subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test
time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable
selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags.
Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both
native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our
physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.

We investigate the high-probability\nconvergence of the vanilla stochastic subgradient descent (SsGD) method under\nsub-Weibull noises, as well as the high-probability and in-expectation\nconvergence of clipped SsGD under the $p$-BCM noises. Both analyses are\nconducted in the context of weakly convex optimization. For weakly convex\nobjectives that may be non-convex and non-smooth, our results demonstrate that\nthe theoretical dependence of vanilla SsGD on the failure probability and\nnumber of iterations under sub-Weibull noises does not degrade compared to the\ncase of smooth objectives. Under $p$-BCM noises, our findings indicate that the\nnon-smoothness and non-convexity of weakly convex objectives do not impact the\ntheoretical dependence of clipped SGD on the failure probability relative to\nthe smooth case; however, the sample complexity we derived is worse than a\nwell-known lower bound for smooth optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper analyzes stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) under heavy-tailed gradient noises, focusing on sub-Weibull and $p$-BCM noises.

### [1] [ReStNet: A Reusable & Stitchable Network for Dynamic Adaptation on IoT Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09066)
*Maoyu Wang,Yao Lu,Jiaqi Nie,Zeyu Wang,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReStNet is a dynamic network stitching method for adapting pre-trained models to varying IoT device resources, using layer-wise similarity and selective fine-tuning for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inflexibility of traditional model compression methods in adapting to heterogeneous IoT device resources.

Method: Uses Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to select stitching points, combines layers from different models, and fine-tunes only the stitching layer.

Result: Achieves flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, reduces training costs, and supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous model stitching.

Conclusion: ReStNet provides a scalable and efficient solution for deploying pre-trained models across diverse IoT platforms.

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained
models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in
real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess
heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to
deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression
methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve
efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing
resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable
and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by
stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires
addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal
stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,
and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these
challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the
stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel
Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers
from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To
facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This
design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging
available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,
Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,
allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training
cost.

### [2] [Enhancing the Safety of Medical Vision-Language Models by Synthetic Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09067)
*Zhiyu Xue,Reza Abbasi-Asl,Ramtin Pedarsani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inference-time defense strategy for generative medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) to mitigate harmful queries while avoiding over-defense, using synthetic clinical demonstrations and a mixed demonstration strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Med-VLMs face security vulnerabilities, such as handling harmful queries without over-defending and rejecting benign ones, which remains underexplored.

Method: A novel inference-time defense strategy is introduced, leveraging synthetic clinical demonstrations to enhance safety against visual and textual jailbreak attacks.

Result: The strategy improves model safety without significant performance degradation, with increased demonstration budgets alleviating over-defense. A mixed demonstration strategy balances security and performance under few-shot constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed defense strategy effectively addresses security concerns in Med-VLMs while maintaining general performance, offering a practical solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed
to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from
multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language
modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities
remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries,
such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for
insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the
risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general
performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper,
we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries,
enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse
medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that
our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model
safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find
that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We
then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for
balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget
constraints.

### [4] [Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF):An automatic segmentation model for building facades, walls and windows based on multimodal semantics guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09071)
*Peilin Li,Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Ran Luo,Pengyu Zeng,Miao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAAF is an automatic segmentation model for building facades using multimodal semantic guidance, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving efficiency in building information models and CAD by automating wall and window segmentation.

Method: Combines NLP and image features in an end-to-end training framework for semantic understanding and segmentation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in mIoU metric, showing high precision across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Advances architectural computer vision and explores multimodal learning applications in architecture.

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic
segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of
building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an
automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on
multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF).
First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction
mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the
semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the
semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an
end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the
mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the
influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the
automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive
experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF
outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF
model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse
datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and
generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected
to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision
technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application
of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

### [5] [VersaVid-R1: A Versatile Video Understanding and Reasoning Model from Question Answering to Captioning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09079)
*Xinlong Chen,Yuanxing Zhang,Yushuo Guan,Bohan Zeng,Yang Shi,Sihan Yang,Pengfei Wan,Qiang Liu,Liang Wang,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA datasets and VersaVid-R1, a model for advanced video reasoning, outperforming existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based reasoning is underdeveloped due to lack of quality data and training methods.

Method: Created two datasets (DarkEventInfer, MixVidQA) and trained VersaVid-R1 using reinforcement learning with diverse rewards.

Result: VersaVid-R1 outperforms existing models in video understanding, reasoning, and captioning tasks.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap in video reasoning, demonstrating superior performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully
extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet
video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training
methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA,
two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced
video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos
with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content
based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents
interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models
to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these
carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided
by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video
understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm
capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well
as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1
significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of
benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and
captioning tasks.

*Zheqi He,Yesheng Liu,Jing-shu Zheng,Xuejing Li,Richeng Xuan,Jin-Ge Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlagEvalMM is an open-source framework for evaluating multimodal models on vision-language tasks, offering flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive and efficient tool for assessing multimodal models across diverse vision-language tasks.

Method: Decouples model inference from evaluation, uses advanced inference acceleration tools, and employs asynchronous data loading.

Result: FlagEvalMM delivers accurate and efficient insights into model performance, enhancing multimodal research.

Conclusion: FlagEvalMM is a valuable, publicly accessible framework for advancing multimodal model evaluation.

comprehensively assess multimodal models across a diverse range of
vision-language understanding and generation tasks, such as visual question
answering, text-to-image/video generation, and image-text retrieval. We
decouple model inference from evaluation through an independent evaluation
service, thus enabling flexible resource allocation and seamless integration of
new tasks and models. Moreover, FlagEvalMM utilizes advanced inference
acceleration tools (e.g., vLLM, SGLang) and asynchronous data loading to
significantly enhance evaluation efficiency. Extensive experiments show that
FlagEvalMM offers accurate and efficient insights into model strengths and
limitations, making it a valuable tool for advancing multimodal research. The
framework is publicly accessible athttps://github.com/flageval-baai/FlagEvalMM.

### [7] [AVA-Bench: Atomic Visual Ability Benchmark for Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09082)
*Zheda Mai,Arpita Chowdhury,Zihe Wang,Sooyoung Jeon,Lemeng Wang,Jiacheng Hou,Jihyung Kil,Wei-Lun Chao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVA-Bench is introduced to evaluate vision foundation models (VFMs) by disentangling 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs), addressing gaps in current VQA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA benchmarks have blind spots: misaligned instruction tuning data and inability to pinpoint specific visual shortcomings. AVA-Bench aims to provide precise evaluation.

Method: AVA-Bench decouples 14 AVAs (e.g., localization, depth estimation) and matches training/test distributions for each, enabling clear identification of VFM strengths/weaknesses.

Result: AVA-Bench reveals distinct "ability fingerprints" for VFMs and shows a 0.5B LLM performs similarly to a 7B LLM while being 8x more efficient.

Conclusion: AVA-Bench offers a transparent and comprehensive benchmark to guide VFM development and selection, advancing the field.

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation.
A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question
Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i)
the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning
a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual
shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities,
making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities
or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench,
the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities
(AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial
understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By
decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each,
AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench
to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM
selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find
that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours
by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and
transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next
generation of VFMs.

### [8] [BakuFlow: A Streamlining Semi-Automatic Label Generation Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09083)
*Jerry Lin,Partick P. W. Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BakuFlow is a semi-automatic labeling tool for computer vision, featuring precise manual corrections, data augmentation, label propagation, and automatic labeling with a modified YOLOE framework, improving efficiency in large-scale tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling in computer vision is time-consuming and error-prone, especially for large-scale tasks, necessitating more efficient tools.

Method: BakuFlow integrates a live adjustable magnifier, interactive data augmentation, label propagation, and a modified YOLOE framework for automatic labeling.

Result: The tool reduces labeling workload and improves efficiency, particularly for object detection and tracking in dynamic datasets.

Conclusion: BakuFlow offers a scalable and flexible solution for efficient data annotation in computer vision, addressing the limitations of manual labeling.

Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer
vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is
time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the
labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each
image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic
label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for
pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive
data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation
for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly
accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module
powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension
supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class
during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic,
real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for
object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and
improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

### [9] [Bias Analysis in Unconditional Image Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09106)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Michelle Lin,Simon Lacoste-Julien,Aaron Courville,Yash Goyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates bias in unconditional generative AI models, finding small attribute shifts but highlighting sensitivity to classifier choice in bias evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how bias emerges in unconditional generative models and the role of evaluation frameworks in detecting bias.

Method: Training unconditional image generative models and using a bias evaluation framework to analyze shifts between training and generated distributions.

Result: Small attribute shifts were detected, but the evaluation was sensitive to the classifier, especially for non-binary attributes.

Conclusion: The study calls for better labeling practices, scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognition of the social complexity of attributes in bias assessment.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns
about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite
growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges -
especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the
bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence
in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference
distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative
models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift
between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the
detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are
sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the
evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in
high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier
sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as
opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more
representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through
greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex
nature of attributes when evaluating bias.

### [10] [CAIRe: Cultural Attribution of Images by Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09109)
*Arnav Yayavaram,Siddharth Yayavaram,Simran Khanuja,Michael Saxon,Graham Neubig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIRe is a new metric for evaluating cultural relevance in text-to-image models, outperforming baselines by 28% F1 and aligning well with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing cross-cultural biases in text-to-image models, which face trade-offs like performance loss or offensive outputs, requires reliable measurement tools.

Method: CAIRe evaluates cultural relevance by grounding image entities in a knowledge base and using factual information for graded judgments.

Result: CAIRe surpasses baselines by 28% F1 on a rare-items dataset and achieves Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings.

Conclusion: CAIRe effectively measures cultural relevance, aligning with human judgment and addressing a critical gap in bias evaluation.

Abstract: As text-to-image models become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
equitable performance across diverse cultural contexts is critical. Efforts to
mitigate cross-cultural biases have been hampered by trade-offs, including a
loss in performance, factual inaccuracies, or offensive outputs. Despite
widespread recognition of these challenges, an inability to reliably measure
these biases has stalled progress. To address this gap, we introduce CAIRe, a
novel evaluation metric that assesses the degree of cultural relevance of an
image, given a user-defined set of labels. Our framework grounds entities and
concepts in the image to a knowledge base and uses factual information to give
independent graded judgments for each culture label. On a manually curated
dataset of culturally salient but rare items built using language models, CAIRe
surpasses all baselines by 28% F1 points. Additionally, we construct two
datasets for culturally universal concept, one comprising of T2I-generated
outputs and another retrieved from naturally occurring data. CAIRe achieves
Pearson's correlations of 0.56 and 0.66 with human ratings on these sets, based
on a 5-point Likert scale of cultural relevance. This demonstrates its strong
alignment with human judgment across diverse image sources.

augmented with precision and meaningful video captioning, enabling
comprehensive learning across diverse scenarios; (ii) an efficient architecture
design with proposed training paradigm, which allows for natively supporting
multi-shot generation and jointly learning of both text-to-video and

(iv) excellent model acceleration achieving ~10x inference speedup through
multi-stage distillation strategies and system-level optimizations. Seedance
1.0 can generate a 5-second video at 1080p resolution only with 41.4 seconds
(NVIDIA-L20). Compared to state-of-the-art video generation models, Seedance
1.0 stands out with high-quality and fast video generation having superior
spatiotemporal fluidity with structural stability, precise instruction
adherence in complex multi-subject contexts, native multi-shot narrative
coherence with consistent subject representation.

*Sungwon Hwang,Hyojin Jang,Kinam Kim,Minho Park,Jaegul choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREPA, a novel technique for fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) to improve visual fidelity and semantic coherence across frames, addressing limitations of existing methods like REPA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VDMs for user-specific attributes is challenging and underexplored, despite its practical importance. REPA shows promise but is suboptimal for preserving cross-frame consistency.

Method: The authors adapt REPA for VDMs and propose CREPA, a regularization technique aligning hidden states of a frame with external features from neighboring frames.

Result: CREPA improves visual fidelity and semantic coherence in large-scale VDMs like CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, validated across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: CREPA is a broadly applicable solution for enhancing VDM fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods in preserving semantic consistency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) at the user level to generate
videos that reflect specific attributes of training data presents notable
challenges, yet remains underexplored despite its practical importance.
Meanwhile, recent work such as Representation Alignment (REPA) has shown
promise in improving the convergence and quality of DiT-based image diffusion
models by aligning, or assimilating, its internal hidden states with external
pretrained visual features, suggesting its potential for VDM fine-tuning. In
this work, we first propose a straightforward adaptation of REPA for VDMs and
empirically show that, while effective for convergence, it is suboptimal in
preserving semantic consistency across frames. To address this limitation, we
introduce Cross-frame Representation Alignment (CREPA), a novel regularization
technique that aligns hidden states of a frame with external features from
neighboring frames. Empirical evaluations on large-scale VDMs, including
CogVideoX-5B and Hunyuan Video, demonstrate that CREPA improves both visual
fidelity and cross-frame semantic coherence when fine-tuned with
parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA. We further validate CREPA across
diverse datasets with varying attributes, confirming its broad applicability.

*Mojtaba Nafez,Amirhossein Koochakian,Arad Maleki,Jafar Habibi,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PatchGuard introduces a robust AD and AL method using pseudo anomalies and ViT architecture, outperforming previous methods in adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AD and AL methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to limited training data (only normal samples). PatchGuard addresses this by incorporating pseudo anomalies.

Method: Uses Foreground-Aware Pseudo-Anomalies in a ViT-based framework with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function.

Result: Achieves 53.2% improvement in AD and 68.5% in AL in adversarial settings, while maintaining accuracy in non-adversarial cases.

Conclusion: PatchGuard is a robust solution for AD and AL, validated on industrial and medical datasets.

Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) and Anomaly Localization (AL) are crucial in fields
that demand high reliability, such as medical imaging and industrial
monitoring. However, current AD and AL approaches are often susceptible to
adversarial attacks due to limitations in training data, which typically
include only normal, unlabeled samples. This study introduces PatchGuard, an
adversarially robust AD and AL method that incorporates pseudo anomalies with
localization masks within a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture to
address these vulnerabilities. We begin by examining the essential properties
of pseudo anomalies, and follow it by providing theoretical insights into the
attention mechanisms required to enhance the adversarial robustness of AD and
AL systems. We then present our approach, which leverages Foreground-Aware
Pseudo-Anomalies to overcome the deficiencies of previous anomaly-aware
methods. Our method incorporates these crafted pseudo-anomaly samples into a
ViT-based framework, with adversarial training guided by a novel loss function
designed to improve model robustness, as supported by our theoretical analysis.
Experimental results on well-established industrial and medical datasets
demonstrate that PatchGuard significantly outperforms previous methods in
adversarial settings, achieving performance gains of $53.2\%$ in AD and
$68.5\%$ in AL, while also maintaining competitive accuracy in non-adversarial
settings. The code repository is available at

### [14] [UFM: A Simple Path towards Unified Dense Correspondence with Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09278)
*Yuchen Zhang,Nikhil Keetha,Chenwei Lyu,Bhuvan Jhamb,Yutian Chen,Yuheng Qiu,Jay Karhade,Shreyas Jha,Yaoyu Hu,Deva Ramanan,Sebastian Scherer,Wenshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UFM is a unified model for dense image correspondence, outperforming specialized methods in both flow estimation and wide-baseline matching with higher accuracy, lower error, and faster performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common goal of matching content between images, historically tackled separately for wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation.

Method: UFM uses a simple transformer architecture trained on unified data for co-visible pixels, directly regressing (u,v) flow without coarse-to-fine cost volumes.

Result: UFM is 28% more accurate than state-of-the-art flow methods, 62% less error and 6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers.

Conclusion: UFM demonstrates unified training can outperform specialized approaches, enabling fast, general-purpose correspondence and opening new research directions.

Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual
odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification.
Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for
wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of
matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &
Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are
co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic
transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier
to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical
coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than
state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and
6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to
demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across
both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and
opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery necessitates a custom dataset and efficient model for real-time detection in emergency scenarios.

Method: YOLOv4-Tiny is optimized via post-training quantization to INT8 precision and trained on a custom aerial emergency dataset of 10,820 annotated images.

Result: The quantized model reduces size by 71% (to 6.4 MB) and speeds up inference by 44%, while maintaining comparable detection performance.

Conclusion: The quantized YOLOv4-Tiny is ideal for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight and energy-efficient object detection
solution for aerial imagery captured during emergency response situations. We
focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural
network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The
model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of
10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior
works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset
ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery,
making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model
is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental
results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable
detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and
improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a
44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly
suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.

TL;DR: A multi-modal self-supervised learning framework for remote sensing image interpretation, leveraging RGB, multi-spectral data, and DSM, outperforms existing methods in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality labeled data is costly and time-consuming to acquire, necessitating an efficient pre-training method.

Method: Proposes a framework with adaptive masking, cross-modal masking, and multi-task self-supervised objectives to capture inter-modal correlations and intra-modal features.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in 26 tasks across 15 datasets, achieving high mIoU scores and reduced RMSE errors.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for remote sensing tasks, offering improved performance with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Remote sensing image interpretation plays a critical role in environmental
monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, acquiring
high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this
challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that
leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface
models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive
masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised
objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across
different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We
evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical
remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic
segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation.
Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks.
The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and
Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of
78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation
task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection
task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing
the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points. Our pretrain code, checkpoints, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CheckManual, a benchmark for manual-based appliance manipulation, addressing gaps in prior research by leveraging manuals for robot task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks focus on multi-page manuals for appliance manipulation, limiting robots' ability to perform tasks like heating bread in a microwave.

Method: The authors propose a data generation pipeline using CAD models to create manuals, establish challenges and metrics, and develop the ManualPlan model for manipulation planning.

Result: CheckManual provides a benchmark with manuals, challenges, and a simulator for evaluating models, with ManualPlan serving as a baseline.

Conclusion: The work advances robot manipulation by integrating manuals, offering a new benchmark and baseline model for future research.

Abstract: Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life
quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense,
different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by
manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should
enable them to review the microwave manual first. From the manual, it can learn
about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps
about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to
question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the
manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this
paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark
CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data
generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these
manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and
simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we
propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up
a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark.

TL;DR: A comprehensive multimodal action recognition solution is proposed, leveraging data enhancement, transfer learning, and advanced feature extraction to achieve high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of tri-modal action recognition due to scarce data by effectively utilizing multimodal information.

Method: Optimized data enhancement, transfer learning with RGB datasets, 2D CNNs with TSM for spatial-temporal features, and prediction enhancement techniques like SWA, Ensemble, and TTA.

Result: Achieved Top-1 accuracy of 99% and Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the competition leaderboard.

Conclusion: The proposed solution demonstrates superiority in multimodal action recognition by effectively combining techniques to overcome data scarcity and enhance performance.

Abstract: Recently, multimodal tasks have strongly advanced the field of action
recognition with their rich multimodal information. However, due to the
scarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks
faces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal
action recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information.
First, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data
enhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more
RGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better
adapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal
spatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the
Temporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature
extraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In
addition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight
Averaging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to
integrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same
architecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from
different perspectives and fully exploit the target information. Ultimately, we
achieved the Top-1 accuracy of 99% and the Top-5 accuracy of 100% on the
competition leaderboard, demonstrating the superiority of our solution.

Motivation: Existing video generation models are too slow for real-time and interactive applications.

Method: Autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) with 1NFE per frame, leveraging adversarial training and KV cache for efficiency.

Result: Achieves 24fps at 736x416 on a single H100 or 1280x720 on 8xH100 for up to 1440 frames.

Conclusion: AAPT enables efficient, real-time, and interactive video generation with reduced error accumulation.

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive,
preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we
propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a
pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video
generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using
a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to
the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate
the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores
adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation.
This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for
one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables
training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in
reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments
demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video
generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to
a minute long (1440 frames). Visit our research website at

*Junchao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel variational framework for 2D image segmentation using shape analysis and diffeomorphic transformations, avoiding reliance on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like edge detection and deep learning approaches often require extensive training data, prompting the need for a flexible, theoretically grounded alternative.

Method: Proposes a variational framework integrating shape analysis and diffeomorphic transformations, using LDDMM and varifold representation for curve evolution guided by image gradients.

Result: Implemented in Python with GPU acceleration, the method achieves accurate segmentation without large datasets.

Conclusion: The framework offers a flexible, data-efficient solution for image segmentation, combining theoretical rigor with practical implementation.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision aimed at
delineating object boundaries within images. Traditional approaches, such as
edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent
advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require
extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework
for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and
diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the
deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image
domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)
framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the
deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold
representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with
GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate
segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does
not rely on large datasets.

*Hongguang Zhu,Yunchao Wei,Mengyu Wang,Siyu Jiao,Yan Fang,Jiannan Huang,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE introduces semantic-augment erasing and a global-local retention mechanism to improve concept erasure in diffusion models, ensuring safer text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety risks like unsafe content and copyright infringement in diffusion models by improving concept erasure methods.

Method: Uses semantic-augment erasing to transform word erasure into domain erasure and a global-local retention mechanism to preserve irrelevant concepts.

Result: SAGE outperforms existing methods in safe generation, demonstrating comprehensive superiority.

Conclusion: SAGE effectively erases unsafe concepts while retaining irrelevant ones, enhancing the safety of diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image
generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during
pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and
copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn
undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However,
existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it,
trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized
concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment
erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by
the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns
the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial
relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional
preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of
irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the
global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic
relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively
expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our
method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive
superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs.

Motivation: To develop a domain-agnostic LSD model that works robustly for any natural images by leveraging scalable self-supervised learning.

Method: Revisits and streamlines LSD approaches, proposing ScaleLSD, a high-performing and efficient learner trained on over 10M unlabeled images.

Result: ScaleLSD detects more line segments with higher accuracy, excelling in zero-shot detection, 3D geometry estimation, and line matching tasks.

Conclusion: ScaleLSD is the first deep LSD approach to surpass non-deep methods in all tested aspects, enhancing image line geometry versatility.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Line Segment Detection (LSD) for the
characterization of line geometry in images, with the aim of learning a
domain-agnostic robust LSD model that works well for any natural images. With
the focus of scalable self-supervised learning of LSD, we revisit and
streamline the fundamental designs of (deep and non-deep) LSD approaches to
have a high-performing and efficient LSD learner, dubbed as ScaleLSD, for the
curation of line geometry at scale from over 10M unlabeled real-world images.
Our ScaleLSD works very well to detect much more number of line segments from
any natural images even than the pioneered non-deep LSD approach, having a more
complete and accurate geometric characterization of images using line segments.
Experimentally, our proposed ScaleLSD is comprehensively testified under
zero-shot protocols in detection performance, single-view 3D geometry
estimation, two-view line segment matching, and multiview 3D line mapping, all
with excellent performance obtained. Based on the thorough evaluation, our
ScaleLSD is observed to be the first deep approach that outperforms the
pioneered non-deep LSD in all aspects we have tested, significantly expanding
and reinforcing the versatility of the line geometry of images. Code and Models

TL;DR: UniForward is a feed-forward model for real-time 3D scene and semantic field reconstruction from uncalibrated sparse-view images, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify 3D scene and semantic field reconstruction for better environment perception, addressing challenges like embedding semantics into 3D representations and real-time generalizability.

Method: Proposes UniForward, a dual-branch decoupled decoder model embedding semantic features into 3D Gaussians, trained with a loss-guided view sampler and photometric/distillation losses.

Result: Achieves high-quality 3D scene rendering and view-consistent semantic features, enabling dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.

Conclusion: UniForward outperforms existing methods in novel view synthesis and segmentation, unifying 3D and semantic reconstruction effectively.

Abstract: We propose a feed-forward Gaussian Splatting model that unifies 3D scene and
semantic field reconstruction. Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields
facilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.
However, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations,
achieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical
applicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground
truth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to
predict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated
and unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D
scene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and
predict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we
propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard,
eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous
methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained
end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages
semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage,
our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields
in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve
high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the
rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can
be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.
Experiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene
and semantic field reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ReID methods and datasets are limited to few modalities, failing to handle real-world multi-modal queries.

Method: Constructed ORBench dataset with 1,000 identities across five modalities and proposed ReID5o, a framework for unified multi-modal learning.

Result: ReID5o outperforms other models on ORBench, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work advances multi-modal ReID with a practical dataset and framework, encouraging further research.

Abstract: In real-word scenarios, person re-identification (ReID) expects to identify a
person-of-interest via the descriptive query, regardless of whether the query
is a single modality or a combination of multiple modalities. However, existing
methods and datasets remain constrained to limited modalities, failing to meet
this requirement. Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called
Omni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve
effective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries. To address dataset
scarcity, we construct ORBench, the first high-quality multi-modal dataset
comprising 1,000 unique identities across five modalities: RGB, infrared, color
pencil, sketch, and textual description. This dataset also has significant
superiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and
textual information. It could serve as an ideal platform for follow-up
investigations in OM-ReID. Moreover, we propose ReID5o, a novel multi-modal
learning framework for person ReID. It enables synergistic fusion and
cross-modal alignment of arbitrary modality combinations in a single model,
with a unified encoding and multi-expert routing mechanism proposed. Extensive
experiments verify the advancement and practicality of our ORBench. A wide
range of possible models have been evaluated and compared on it, and our
proposed ReID5o model gives the best performance. The dataset and code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/Zplusdragon/ReID5o_ORBench.

*Kaiyu Guo,Zijian Wang,Brian C. Lovell,Mahsa Baktashmotlagh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dynamic approach for OOD detection corrects geometry distortion from ill-distributed samples by updating the prior covariance matrix in real-time, improving performance across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static subspace-based OOD detection methods fail to handle geometry distortion caused by ill-distributed samples, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed method dynamically adjusts the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features, refining it by reducing covariance along input directions and constraining adjustments to residual space.

Result: The approach significantly enhances OOD detection performance on CIFAR and ImageNet-1k datasets, including the DINO model.

Conclusion: Dynamic adjustment of prior geometry effectively addresses distortion issues, improving OOD detection robustness.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the trustworthiness of
AI systems. Methods using prior information (i.e., subspace-based methods) have
shown effective performance by extracting information geometry to detect OOD
data with a more appropriate distance metric. However, these methods fail to
address the geometry distorted by ill-distributed samples, due to the
limitation of statically extracting information geometry from the training
distribution. In this paper, we argue that the influence of ill-distributed
samples can be corrected by dynamically adjusting the prior geometry in
response to new data. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach that
dynamically updates the prior covariance matrix using real-time input features,
refining its information. Specifically, we reduce the covariance along the
direction of real-time input features and constrain adjustments to the residual
space, thus preserving essential data characteristics and avoiding effects on
unintended directions in the principal space. We evaluate our method on two
pre-trained models for the CIFAR dataset and five pre-trained models for
ImageNet-1k, including the self-supervised DINO model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances OOD detection across
various models. The code is released at https://github.com/workerbcd/ooddcc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SRPL-SFDA, a SAM-guided method for Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in medical image segmentation, enhancing pseudo-label quality and outperforming state-of-the-art SFDA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in SFDA, like insufficient supervision in target domains, while respecting privacy by not requiring source-domain data.

Method: Uses SAM-guided reliable pseudo-labels with test-time intensity enhancement, reliable label selection, and reliability-aware training.

Result: Improves pseudo-label quality and SFDA performance, nearing supervised training results in target domains.

Conclusion: SRPL-SFDA is effective for medical image segmentation under domain shifts, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) is crucial for robust deployment of medical image
segmentation models when applied to new clinical centers with significant
domain shifts. Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal
with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during
adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as
insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this
work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels
method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch
Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw
pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs
with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for
refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that
rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs
(CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training
procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used
for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization.
Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets
for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA
effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and
improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2)
SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is
close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this
work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data for video tasks often has uncanny features, limiting its use in tasks like sign language translation and gesture recognition.

Method: Uses controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models for pose transfer to generate synthetic human action videos.

Result: Improves performance on action recognition tasks (tested on Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets) and scales few-shot datasets effectively.

Conclusion: The method enhances synthetic data utility, addresses underrepresented groups, and is open-sourced with the RANDOM People dataset.

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion,
synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its
effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture
recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus
been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper
proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose
transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate
this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it
improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups
underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We
open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and
avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the
internet.

TL;DR: NCVSD distills pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers by leveraging the unconditional score function, enabling fast generation and iterative refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between diffusion models and efficient generative denoisers while preserving iterative refinement benefits.

Method: Integrates the unconditional score function into the VSD framework to learn generative denoisers for various noise levels.

Result: Outperforms teacher diffusion models, matches larger consistency models, and achieves record LPIPS with fewer NFEs.

Conclusion: NCVSD offers scalable, efficient, and high-quality generative denoising with flexible sampling.

Abstract: We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel
method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We
achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly
characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By
integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD)
framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of
approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide
range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable
properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative
refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian
noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the
test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic
inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through
extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse
problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms
teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes.
Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we
achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.

### [30] [ODG: Occupancy Prediction Using Dual Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09417)
*Yunxiao Shi,Yinhao Zhu,Shizhong Han,Jisoo Jeong,Amin Ansari,Hong Cai,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ODG combines BEV and sparse points representations for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, addressing limitations of each method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D occupancy prediction are either computationally expensive (dense 3D feature volume) or suffer from shortcomings (BEV loses small objects, sparse points struggle with large surfaces).

Method: Proposes ODG, a dual-branch approach: a query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch, with cross-attention for information sharing and fusion of outputs.

Result: Superior performance on Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks with competitive inference speed.

Conclusion: ODG effectively balances accuracy and efficiency by leveraging the strengths of both BEV and sparse points representations.

Abstract: 3D occupancy provides fine-grained 3D geometry and semantics for scene
understanding which is critical for autonomous driving. Most existing methods,
however, carry high compute costs, requiring dense 3D feature volume and
cross-attention to effectively aggregate information. More recent works have
adopted Bird's Eye View (BEV) or sparse points as scene representation with
much reduced cost, but still suffer from their respective shortcomings. More
concretely, BEV struggles with small objects that often experience significant
information loss after being projected to the ground plane. On the other hand,
points can flexibly model little objects in 3D, but is inefficient at capturing
flat surfaces or large objects. To address these challenges, in this paper, we
present a novel 3D occupancy prediction approach, ODG, which combines BEV and
sparse points based representations. We propose a dual-branch design: a
query-based sparse points branch and a BEV branch. The 3D information learned
in the sparse points branch is shared with the BEV stream via cross-attention,
which enriches the weakened signals of difficult objects on the BEV plane. The
outputs of both branches are finally fused to generate predicted 3D occupancy.
We conduct extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo
benchmarks that demonstrate the superiority of our proposed ODG. Moreover, ODG
also delivers competitive inference speed when compared to the latest efficient
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal dataset, and SynJudge, an evaluation model, to improve LMMs' ability to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs struggle with interleaved image-text generation due to limited training data quality and scale.

Method: Developed InterSyn using the SEIR method for dataset refinement and SynJudge for evaluation.

Result: SEIR improves dataset quality, and LMMs trained on InterSyn show performance gains.

Conclusion: InterSyn and SynJudge effectively advance multimodal systems by addressing dataset and evaluation limitations.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly
improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still
struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to
the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training
datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal
dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR)
method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly
interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous
automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training
next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of
reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs,
we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively
assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content,
image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher
dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across
all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal
systems.

### [32] [A Novel Lightweight Transformer with Edge-Aware Fusion for Remote Sensing Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09429)
*Swadhin Das,Divyansh Mundra,Priyanshu Dayal,Raksha Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight transformer architecture is proposed for remote sensing image captioning, addressing high computational costs and fine-grained feature neglect by reducing encoder dimensionality, using a distilled GPT-2 decoder, and incorporating edge-aware enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models for remote sensing image captioning face high computational costs and overlook fine-grained structural features, limiting practical deployment and performance.

Method: The approach reduces encoder dimensionality, employs a distilled GPT-2 decoder, uses knowledge distillation, and integrates edge-aware enhancement for better spatial detail capture.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves caption quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The lightweight transformer with edge-aware enhancement effectively balances computational efficiency and fine-grained feature extraction, enhancing remote sensing image captioning.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved strong performance in remote sensing
image captioning by capturing long-range dependencies and contextual
information. However, their practical deployment is hindered by high
computational costs, especially in multi-modal frameworks that employ separate
transformer-based encoders and decoders. In addition, existing remote sensing
image captioning models primarily focus on high-level semantic extraction while
often overlooking fine-grained structural features such as edges, contours, and
object boundaries. To address these challenges, a lightweight transformer
architecture is proposed by reducing the dimensionality of the encoder layers
and employing a distilled version of GPT-2 as the decoder. A knowledge
distillation strategy is used to transfer knowledge from a more complex teacher
model to improve the performance of the lightweight network. Furthermore, an
edge-aware enhancement strategy is incorporated to enhance image representation
and object boundary understanding, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
spatial details in remote sensing images. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves caption quality compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TOGA is a vision-language model for weakly supervised video QA with temporal grounding, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing video QA with temporal grounding without temporal annotations, leveraging weak supervision.

Method: TOGA is instruct-tuned to jointly generate answers and temporal grounding, using pseudo labels and consistency constraints.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on NExT-GQA, MSVD-QA, and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Jointly generating answers and grounding improves performance, validating the weakly supervised approach.

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal
grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given
a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the
start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for
Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune
TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a
weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not
available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the
validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the
question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question
referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the
answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well
as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For
grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate
weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider
the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art
performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

*Yuhe Ding,Jian Liang,Bo Jiang,Zi Wang,Aihua Zheng,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAM is a framework for CLIP-based domain generalization that harmonizes and merges source models to mitigate conflicts and improve generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from sample and optimization conflicts during multi-source training, hindering generalization.

Method: HAM enriches source samples, harmonizes model updates, and uses redundancy-aware merging to integrate knowledge.

Result: HAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: HAM effectively consolidates domain information and enhances generalization, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to
unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities
of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single
model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information.
However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1)
sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among
sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and
trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and
lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can
effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and
improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose
Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for
CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source
models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and
harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware
historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate
knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source
domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models,
ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities.
Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: A novel open-set domain generalization framework for hyperspectral image classification addresses unknown classes and domain shifts without target domain data, using spectral-spatial feature learning and uncertainty quantification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to handle unknown classes and domain shifts in target domains without adaptation, leading to negative transfer and poor performance.

Method: Proposes a framework with Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement (SIFD), Dual-Channel Residual Network (DCRN), Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty Disentanglement (SSUD) for robust feature extraction and open-set classification.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods without requiring target domain data during training.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses open-set domain generalization challenges in hyperspectral image classification, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification
presents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in
target domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen
domains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods
assume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the
fundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to
negative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that
combines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement
(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network
(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning
(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty
Disentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module
extracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through
attention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while
DCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel
pathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation
using Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable
open-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive
rejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral
classification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the
target domain during training. The implementation will be made available at
https://github.com/amir-khb/SSUDOSDG upon acceptance.

*Maria Damanaki,Nikos Piperigkos,Alexandros Gkillas,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cooperative Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework for 3D LiDAR scenes, using graph topology-aware optimization to fuse multi-agent data and improve tracking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent MOT systems suffer from occlusions and sensor limitations, necessitating multi-agent cooperation for better environmental perception.

Method: A graph topology-aware optimization problem is solved using Graph Laplacian processing to refine bounding box positions and combine multi-agent detections.

Result: The method outperforms baseline frameworks like DMSTrack and V2V4Real on the V2V4Real dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances MOT accuracy by leveraging multi-agent cooperation and graph-based optimization.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving
systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path
planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing
surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration
of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the
environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking
objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware
optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles.
By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding
boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to
smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In
that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent
detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two
stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive
evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset,
where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks,
including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various
testing sequences.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for in-context learning (ICL) in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), addressing challenges in demonstration selection by optimizing policies through self-exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ICL methods rely on pre-defined or heuristic demonstration selection, which is inadequate for diverse tasks and lacks modeling of interactions between demonstrations.

Method: The proposed framework uses exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select demonstrations as an integrated whole.

Result: The approach outperforms on four Visual Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, enhancing few-shot LVLM generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves ICL in LVLMs by autonomously refining demonstration selection policies.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL), a predominant trend in instruction learning, aims
at enhancing the performance of large language models by providing clear task
guidance and examples, improving their capability in task understanding and
execution. This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
and explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing
research efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on
pre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human
intuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements,
leading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each
demonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in
information redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new
exploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores
policies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate
demonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize
themselves by continually refining their demonstrations through
self-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate
the most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental
results verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual
Question-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
the generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Urban1960SatBench, a novel annotated segmentation dataset for historical satellite imagery, and Urban1960SatUSM, an unsupervised segmentation framework, to address quality and annotation challenges in studying urban development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical satellite imagery suffers from severe quality degradation and lack of annotations, hindering semantic segmentation and urban development studies.

Method: The authors create Urban1960SatBench, an annotated dataset, and propose Urban1960SatUSM, an unsupervised framework using confidence-aware alignment and focal-confidence loss.

Result: Urban1960SatUSM outperforms existing methods, enabling robust unsupervised segmentation of historical urban scenes.

Conclusion: The work advances quantitative studies of long-term urban change using historical imagery and modern computer vision.

Abstract: Historical satellite imagery, such as mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole data,
offers rare insights into understanding early urban development and long-term
transformation. However, severe quality degradation (e.g., distortion,
misalignment, and spectral scarcity) and annotation absence have long hindered
semantic segmentation on such historical RS imagery. To bridge this gap and
enhance understanding of urban development, we introduce
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$, an annotated segmentation dataset based on
historical satellite imagery with the earliest observation time among all
existing segmentation datasets, along with a benchmark framework for
unsupervised segmentation tasks, $\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$. First,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatBench}$ serves as a novel, expertly annotated semantic
segmentation dataset built on mid-20$^{th}$ century Keyhole imagery, covering
1,240 km$^2$ and key urban classes (buildings, roads, farmland, water). As the
earliest segmentation dataset of its kind, it provides a pioneering benchmark
for historical urban understanding. Second,
$\textbf{Urban1960SatUSM}$(Unsupervised Segmentation Model) is a novel
unsupervised semantic segmentation framework for historical RS imagery. It
employs a confidence-aware alignment mechanism and focal-confidence loss based
on a self-supervised learning architecture, which generates robust
pseudo-labels and adaptively prioritizes prediction difficulty and label
reliability to improve unsupervised segmentation on noisy historical data
without manual supervision. Experiments show Urban1960SatUSM significantly
outperforms existing unsupervised segmentation methods on Urban1960SatSeg for
segmenting historical urban scenes, promising in paving the way for
quantitative studies of long-term urban change using modern computer vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinySplat introduces a feedforward compression framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), reducing storage costs by 100x while maintaining quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods are incompatible with feedforward architectures, leading to high storage costs. TinySplat addresses this by eliminating redundancy without training.

Method: TinySplat uses View-Projection Transformation (VPT) for geometric redundancy, Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR) for perceptual redundancy, and a video codec for spatial redundancy.

Result: Achieves 100x compression, comparable quality at 6% storage size, and significantly faster encoding (25%) and decoding (1%) times.

Conclusion: TinySplat offers an efficient, training-free solution for compressing 3DGS representations, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a
new paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on
large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations
from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high
reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D
Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization
are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for
generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward
3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that
systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce
View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by
projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present
Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy
by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis
transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an
off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression
for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the
state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only
6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25%
of the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between AR Transformer and diffusion models for better image generation performance and efficiency.

Method: Joint modeling framework: AR Transformer encodes labels/images into semantic features, while a diffusion model estimates image sample distribution. Introduces MRAR for multi-reference autoregression.

Result: Achieves FID of 1.61, IS of 293.4, and faster inference (x2 vs. AR Transformer, x112 vs. diffusion-only). MRAR further reduces FID to 1.42.

Conclusion: TransDiff sets a new standard in image generation, with MRAR enhancing diversity and quality.

Abstract: We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries
Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling
framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic
features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image
samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms
other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion
models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID)
of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster
inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer
and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore,
building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm
called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive
generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference
multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more
diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in
subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is
improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open
up a new frontier in the field of image generation.

*Changhao Peng,Yuqi Ye,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generalized Gaussian entropy model and a Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to improve probability estimation and dynamic likelihood interval adjustment in point cloud attribute compression, enhancing rate-distortion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current entropy models in point cloud compression underutilize information in entropy parameters, limiting accuracy and performance.

Method: Proposes a generalized Gaussian entropy model for better probability estimation and MED for dynamic likelihood interval adjustment.

Result: Significantly improves rate-distortion performance on VAE-based models and is applicable to other compression tasks.

Conclusion: The new method enhances compression efficiency by better utilizing entropy parameters and dynamically adjusting intervals.

Abstract: Gaussian and Laplacian entropy models are proved effective in learned point
cloud attribute compression, as they assist in arithmetic coding of latents.
However, we demonstrate through experiments that there is still unutilized
information in entropy parameters estimated by neural networks in current
methods, which can be used for more accurate probability estimation. Thus we
introduce generalized Gaussian entropy model, which controls the tail shape
through shape parameter to more accurately estimate the probability of latents.
Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods use fixed likelihood
intervals for each integer during arithmetic coding, which limits model
performance. We propose Mean Error Discriminator (MED) to determine whether the
entropy parameter estimation is accurate and then dynamically adjust likelihood
intervals. Experiments show that our method significantly improves
rate-distortion (RD) performance on three VAE-based models for point cloud
attribute compression, and our method can be applied to other compression
tasks, such as image and video compression.

TL;DR: HAIF-GS improves dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular videos by addressing redundant updates, insufficient motion supervision, and complex deformations using sparse anchor-driven deformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggle with structured motion representation, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Method: HAIF-GS uses an Anchor Filter for motion-relevant regions, a self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module, and Hierarchical Anchor Propagation for fine-grained deformations.

Result: HAIF-GS outperforms prior methods in rendering quality, temporal coherence, and efficiency on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: HAIF-GS provides a robust solution for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction, addressing key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos remains a fundamental
challenge in 3D vision. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time
rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due
to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion
representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in
existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,
and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively
hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these
limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured
and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It
first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses
redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided
Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,
eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained
deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor
resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level
transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks
validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in
rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.

*Beomsik Cho,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVisiT is a decoding method for LVLMs that uses vision tokens to guide text generation, improving visual grounding without extra training or external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LVLM decoding strategies often fail to utilize visual information effectively, leading to ungrounded responses.

Method: ReVisiT projects vision tokens into text token space, dynamically selects relevant tokens via divergence minimization, and refines output distributions.

Result: ReVisiT enhances visual grounding with minimal overhead and outperforms baselines while reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: ReVisiT is a simple, effective solution for improving LVLM visual grounding without additional training or resources.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language
understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to
successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded
responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this
limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference
procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a
simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the
text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic
information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text
token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision
token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This
selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better
incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination
benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances
visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method
achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines
while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

Result: Achieves negligible rendering quality loss (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) with only 10% Gaussians, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient, agnostic solution for lightweight neural rendering, applicable to any 3DGS pipeline stage.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance
field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian
primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction
approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance
scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global
Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite
transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric
representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color
and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering
quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians;
and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques.
Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS
pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural
rendering.

*Wenjun Ji,Yuxiang Fu,Luyang Ying,Deng-Ping Fan,Yuyi Wang,Ming-Ming Cheng,Ivor Tsang,Qing Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL) to enhance the angle robustness of text-to-image adversarial patches, improving attack effectiveness across multiple views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image adversarial patches lack robustness against varying viewing angles, limiting their real-world effectiveness. This study aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors propose AngleRoCL, which learns a generalizable concept (text embeddings) to guide T2I models in generating angle-robust adversarial patches.

Result: AngleRoCL significantly improves angle robustness, with over 50% average relative improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles.

Conclusion: The research advances understanding of angle-robust adversarial patches and highlights the link between textual concepts and physical properties in T2I-generated content.

Abstract: Cutting-edge works have demonstrated that text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models can generate adversarial patches that mislead state-of-the-art object
detectors in the physical world, revealing detectors' vulnerabilities and
risks. However, these methods neglect the T2I patches' attack effectiveness
when observed from different views in the physical world (i.e., angle
robustness of the T2I adversarial patches). In this paper, we study the angle
robustness of T2I adversarial patches comprehensively, revealing their
angle-robust issues, demonstrating that texts affect the angle robustness of
generated patches significantly, and task-specific linguistic instructions fail
to enhance the angle robustness. Motivated by the studies, we introduce
Angle-Robust Concept Learning (AngleRoCL), a simple and flexible approach that
learns a generalizable concept (i.e., text embeddings in implementation)
representing the capability of generating angle-robust patches. The learned
concept can be incorporated into textual prompts and guides T2I models to
generate patches with their attack effectiveness inherently resistant to
viewpoint variations. Through extensive simulation and physical-world
experiments on five SOTA detectors across multiple views, we demonstrate that
AngleRoCL significantly enhances the angle robustness of T2I adversarial
patches compared to baseline methods. Our patches maintain high attack success
rates even under challenging viewing conditions, with over 50% average relative
improvement in attack effectiveness across multiple angles. This research
advances the understanding of physically angle-robust patches and provides
insights into the relationship between textual concepts and physical properties
in T2I-generated contents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DGeoDet is a geometry-aware 3D object detection method using RGB images, improving performance via explicit and implicit 3D representations without 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of 3D geometric cues in image-based 3D detection, leading to ambiguity in image-to-3D correspondences.

Method: Uses predicted depth for voxel occupancy and TSDF integration, enhancing 3D awareness without 3D supervision.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with significant mAP improvements on SUN RGB-D, ScanNetV2, and KITTI datasets.

Conclusion: 3DGeoDet effectively enhances 3D geometry understanding and achieves superior detection performance across diverse environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes 3DGeoDet, a novel geometry-aware 3D object detection
approach that effectively handles single- and multi-view RGB images in indoor
and outdoor environments, showcasing its general-purpose applicability. The key
challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric
cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images
and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D
geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on
predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to
learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly
through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D
awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,
the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision
from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D
geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end
training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art
image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across
diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D
dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19
AP3D@0.7 improvement on the KITTI dataset. The project page is available at:

TL;DR: GLD-Road is a two-stage model for efficient and precise road network extraction, combining global efficiency and local refinement, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of road networks is costly, and current deep learning methods either sacrifice accuracy for speed or vice versa. GLD-Road aims to balance both.

Method: GLD-Road uses a two-stage approach: global detection of road nodes and connections, followed by local iterative refinement to fix broken roads.

Result: GLD-Road improves APLS by 1.9% (City-Scale) and 0.67% (SpaceNet3), and reduces retrieval time by 40% vs. Sat2Graph and 92% vs. RNGDet++.

Conclusion: GLD-Road effectively combines global efficiency with local precision, offering a superior solution for road network extraction.

Abstract: Road networks are crucial for mapping, autonomous driving, and disaster
response. While manual annotation is costly, deep learning offers efficient
extraction. Current methods include postprocessing (prone to errors), global
parallel (fast but misses nodes), and local iterative (accurate but slow). We
propose GLD-Road, a two-stage model combining global efficiency and local
precision. First, it detects road nodes and connects them via a Connect Module.
Then, it iteratively refines broken roads using local searches, drastically
reducing computation. Experiments show GLD-Road outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, improving APLS by 1.9% (City-Scale) and 0.67% (SpaceNet3). It also
reduces retrieval time by 40% vs. Sat2Graph (global) and 92% vs. RNGDet++
(local). The experimental results are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD^2-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Chain-of-Thought reasoning in autonomous driving under adverse conditions, featuring 5.4k annotated instances and revealing low model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in challenging autonomous driving scenarios like adverse weather and complex traffic.

Method: AD^2-Bench is designed with comprehensive data coverage, fine-grained annotations, and a dedicated evaluation framework for CoT performance.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs achieve below 60% accuracy on AD^2-Bench, indicating its difficulty and the need for improved reasoning.

Conclusion: AD^2-Bench serves as a standardized platform to advance robust and interpretable autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to
enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal
Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with
adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing
benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT
processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical
gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically
designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes.
AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria:
comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained
annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation
framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of
AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually
annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations
is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented
fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level,
point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting
the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable
end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized
evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in
autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

*Qijing Li,Jingxiang Sun,Liang An,Zhaoqi Su,Hongwen Zhang,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticSplat is a feed-forward method for holistic 3D scene understanding, unifying geometry, appearance, and semantics using 3D Gaussians and latent semantic attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack holistic scene comprehension, have low-quality geometry, or require dense input views, limiting practicality.

Method: SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields with a cost volume representation and uses a two-stage distillation framework for multi-modal semantic feature reconstruction.

Result: The method effectively handles tasks like promptable and open-vocabulary segmentation, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: SemanticSplat advances 3D scene understanding by unifying geometry, appearance, and semantics in a practical, feed-forward framework.

Abstract: Holistic 3D scene understanding, which jointly models geometry, appearance,
and semantics, is crucial for applications like augmented reality and robotic
interaction. Existing feed-forward 3D scene understanding methods (e.g., LSM)
are limited to extracting language-based semantics from scenes, failing to
achieve holistic scene comprehension. Additionally, they suffer from
low-quality geometry reconstruction and noisy artifacts. In contrast, per-scene
optimization methods rely on dense input views, which reduces practicality and
increases complexity during deployment. In this paper, we propose
SemanticSplat, a feed-forward semantic-aware 3D reconstruction method, which
unifies 3D Gaussians with latent semantic attributes for joint
geometry-appearance-semantics modeling. To predict the semantic anisotropic
Gaussians, SemanticSplat fuses diverse feature fields (e.g., LSeg, SAM) with a
cost volume representation that stores cross-view feature similarities,
enhancing coherent and accurate scene comprehension. Leveraging a two-stage
distillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal
semantic feature field from sparse-view images. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method for 3D scene understanding tasks like promptable
and open-vocabulary segmentation. Video results are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing, a training-free method to improve subject consistency in text-to-image generation for visual storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a key requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods are either resource-intensive or ineffective.

Method: The proposed approach uses a zigzag sampling mechanism with asymmetric prompts and a visual sharing module to enhance consistency without additional training.

Result: The method outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories, as shown by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: The training-free Zigzag Sampling strategy effectively improves subject consistency in visual story generation, offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing
high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle
with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental
requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this
by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which
is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share
information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this
paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag
Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject
consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling
mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject
characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across
generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based
on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and
consistent visual stories. The code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECAM, a contrastive learning-based module to improve collision avoidance in human trajectory forecasting by integrating environmental context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory forecasting methods often neglect environmental impact, leading to collisions. Addressing this gap is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: ECAM, a contrastive learning-based module, is proposed to enhance collision avoidance with the environment. It can be integrated into existing models.

Result: Experiments on ETH/UCY dataset show a 40-50% reduction in collision rates when ECAM is integrated with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ECAM effectively improves collision avoidance in trajectory forecasting, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Human trajectory forecasting is crucial in applications such as autonomous
driving, robotics and surveillance. Accurate forecasting requires models to
consider various factors, including social interactions, multi-modal
predictions, pedestrian intention and environmental context. While existing
methods account for these factors, they often overlook the impact of the
environment, which leads to collisions with obstacles. This paper introduces
ECAM (Environmental Collision Avoidance Module), a contrastive learning-based
module to enhance collision avoidance ability with the environment. The
proposed module can be integrated into existing trajectory forecasting models,
improving their ability to generate collision-free predictions. We evaluate our
method on the ETH/UCY dataset and quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate
its collision avoidance capabilities. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art methods significantly reduce (-40/50%) the collision rate when
integrated with the proposed module. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSENet improves 3D medical image analysis by combining dual-3D vision encoders and a Spatial Packer for better diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on 2D medical images, limiting their ability to capture complex 3D structures and leading to diagnostic errors.

Method: HSENet uses dual-3D vision encoders for global and fine-grained details, pre-trained with diagnostic reports, and a Spatial Packer for efficient visual token compression.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D language-visual retrieval (39.85% R@100), report generation (24.01% BLEU-4), and visual question answering (73.60% accuracy).

Conclusion: HSENet effectively bridges 3D visual and language understanding, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based
decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in
visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical
images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D
anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of
subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we
present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits
enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection
for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet
employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and
fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment
with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient
multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a
compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By
assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly
perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,
facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report
generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering
(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGAE improves autoencoder performance under high compression by using a diffusion model to guide the decoder, achieving compact latent representations and faster convergence in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address training instability and performance degradation in autoencoders under high compression, while minimizing latent space dimensionality.

Method: Propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder for better signal recovery from latent representations.

Result: DGAE mitigates performance degradation under high compression, achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space, and speeds up diffusion model convergence.

Conclusion: DGAE effectively combines autoencoders and diffusion models for efficient, high-performance image generation.

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by
compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although
recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders
under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by
GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim
to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and
compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the
decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a
diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are
not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE
effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial
compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance
with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE
demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and
shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of
the diffusion model.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method, HopaDIFF, for textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, addressing limitations of existing single-person approaches. It also presents the RHAS133 dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing action segmentation methods focus on single-person activities with fixed sequences, neglecting multi-person scenarios. This work aims to bridge this gap by enabling segmentation based on textual descriptions of target persons.

Method: The proposed HopaDIFF framework combines a cross-input gate attentional xLSTM for holistic-partial reasoning and a Fourier condition for fine-grained control in action segmentation generation.

Result: HopaDIFF outperforms existing methods on the new RHAS133 dataset, demonstrating superior performance in multi-person action segmentation.

Conclusion: The work advances multi-person action segmentation by introducing a robust framework and dataset, setting a new benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding,
aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from
a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person
activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In
this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in
multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person
for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action
Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137
fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions
for this new task. Benchmarking existing action recognition methods on RHAS133
using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor
aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a
holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF,
leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance
holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to
introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation
generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse

TL;DR: DeGSS introduces a unified framework for 3D representation of articulated objects using deformable Gaussian fields, enabling unsupervised part segmentation and precise kinematic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unified representations of articulated objects without human annotation, limiting applications.

Method: DeGSS encodes objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, modeling interaction states as smooth deformations and enabling unsupervised part segmentation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and stability, validated on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: DeGSS provides a robust, unsupervised solution for articulated object representation, advancing part-level reconstruction and kinematic modeling.

Abstract: Articulated objects are ubiquitous in everyday life, and accurate 3D
representations of their geometry and motion are critical for numerous
applications. However, in the absence of human annotation, existing approaches
still struggle to build a unified representation for objects that contain
multiple movable parts. We introduce DeGSS, a unified framework that encodes
articulated objects as deformable 3D Gaussian fields, embedding geometry,
appearance, and motion in one compact representation. Each interaction state is
modeled as a smooth deformation of a shared field, and the resulting
deformation trajectories guide a progressive coarse-to-fine part segmentation
that identifies distinct rigid components, all in an unsupervised manner. The
refined field provides a spatially continuous, fully decoupled description of
every part, supporting part-level reconstruction and precise modeling of their
kinematic relationships. To evaluate generalization and realism, we enlarge the
synthetic PartNet-Mobility benchmark and release RS-Art, a real-to-sim dataset
that pairs RGB captures with accurately reverse-engineered 3D models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Studying rapid neurodevelopment in fetal and neonatal brains requires accurate atlases, but existing methods rely on large datasets, which are scarce for pathological cases.

Method: CINeMA operates in latent space, avoiding compute-intensive registration and enabling flexible conditioning on anatomical features and pathologies.

Result: CINeMA reduces atlas construction time from days to minutes, supports downstream tasks like segmentation and age prediction, and generates synthetic data.

Conclusion: CINeMA is a versatile and efficient tool for brain research, with released code and atlases available.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging of fetal and neonatal brains reveals rapid
neurodevelopment marked by substantial anatomical changes unfolding within
days. Studying this critical stage of the developing human brain, therefore,
requires accurate brain models-referred to as atlases-of high spatial and
temporal resolution. To meet these demands, established traditional atlases and
recently proposed deep learning-based methods rely on large and comprehensive
datasets. This poses a major challenge for studying brains in the presence of
pathologies for which data remains scarce. We address this limitation with
CINeMA (Conditional Implicit Neural Multi-Modal Atlas), a novel framework for
creating high-resolution, spatio-temporal, multimodal brain atlases, suitable
for low-data settings. Unlike established methods, CINeMA operates in latent
space, avoiding compute-intensive image registration and reducing atlas
construction times from days to minutes. Furthermore, it enables flexible
conditioning on anatomical features including GA, birth age, and pathologies
like ventriculomegaly (VM) and agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC). CINeMA
supports downstream tasks such as tissue segmentation and age prediction
whereas its generative properties enable synthetic data creation and
anatomically informed data augmentation. Surpassing state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, efficiency, and versatility, CINeMA represents a powerful tool for
advancing brain research. We release the code and atlases at

Motivation: To assess the underexplored ability of reasoning models to withstand manipulative user feedback.

Method: Systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art reasoning models (OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Gemini-2.5-Flash) across multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, MathVista, CharXiv) and the introduction of GaslightingBench-R.

Result: Accuracy drops of 25-29% under gaslighting prompts, with GaslightingBench-R causing drops exceeding 53%.

Conclusion: Reasoning models have fundamental robustness limitations, exposing a gap between step-by-step reasoning and belief persistence.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness
through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling.
However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains
underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three
state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet
and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and
CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average)
following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning
models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback.
Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this
vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend
their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and
curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks,
GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops
exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the
robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step

*Imanol Miranda,Ander Salaberria,Eneko Agirre,Gorka Azkune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an inference-time technique to improve compositionality in dual encoder VLMs by structuring image-text matching through crops and text segments, showing consistent performance gains without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dual encoder VLMs like CLIP struggle with compositionality, limiting retrieval performance. While training approaches exist, inference-time techniques are understudied.

Method: The method involves dividing images into crops, extracting text segments (objects, attributes, relations), aligning crops with segments using a VLM, and aggregating similarities for final scoring.

Result: The approach improves performance of VLMs without training, especially in attribute-object binding, with image crop processing being crucial for gains.

Conclusion: Inference-time techniques hold potential for enhancing VLMs, with identified areas for further improvement.

Abstract: Dual encoder Vision-Language Models (VLM) such as CLIP are widely used for
image-text retrieval tasks. However, those models struggle with
compositionality, showing a bag-of-words-like behavior that limits their
retrieval performance. Many different training approaches have been proposed to
improve the vision-language compositionality capabilities of those models. In
comparison, inference-time techniques have received little attention. In this
paper, we propose to add simple structure at inference, where, given an image
and a caption: i) we divide the image into different smaller crops, ii) we
extract text segments, capturing objects, attributes and relations, iii) using
a VLM, we find the image crops that better align with text segments obtaining
matches, and iv) we compute the final image-text similarity aggregating the
individual similarities of the matches. Based on various popular dual encoder
VLMs, we evaluate our approach in controlled and natural datasets for VL
compositionality. We find that our approach consistently improves the
performance of evaluated VLMs without any training, which shows the potential
of inference-time techniques. The results are especially good for
attribute-object binding as shown in the controlled dataset. As a result of an
extensive analysis: i) we show that processing image crops is actually
essential for the observed gains in performance, and ii) we identify specific
areas to further improve inference-time approaches.

TL;DR: FasterSNN, a hybrid spiking neural network, improves Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis by combining LIF neurons, region-adaptive convolution, and multi-scale spiking attention for efficient and accurate 3D MRI processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early AD diagnosis is challenging due to subjective assessments and costly imaging. Deep learning is inefficient, while SNNs, though promising, face expressiveness and training issues.

Method: Proposes FasterSNN, integrating LIF neurons, region-adaptive convolution, and multi-scale spiking attention for sparse, efficient 3D MRI processing.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with improved efficiency and stability on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: FasterSNN is a practical solution for AD screening, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the
high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods
offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational
demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained
settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are
inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural
degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and
low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak
expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in
complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a
hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons
with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design
enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic
accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves
competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability,
supporting its potential for practical AD screening. Our source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHIP is a new dataset for 6D pose estimation of chairs in industrial settings, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by including real-world challenges like occlusions and distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for 6D pose estimation lack realism for industrial applications, focusing on household objects or artificial setups. CHIP fills this gap by providing a dataset tailored to industrial conditions.

Method: CHIP includes seven chairs captured with three RGBD sensors, featuring 77,811 annotated images with ground-truth poses derived from robot kinematics. It introduces challenges like occlusions and fine-grained distractors.

Result: Benchmarking with three zero-shot methods reveals significant room for improvement, emphasizing the dataset's difficulty due to sensor variations, occlusion levels, and localization priors.

Conclusion: CHIP addresses a critical need for realistic industrial 6D pose estimation datasets and will be publicly released to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of complex objects in 3D environments is
essential for effective robotic manipulation. Yet, existing benchmarks fall
short in evaluating 6D pose estimation methods under realistic industrial
conditions, as most datasets focus on household objects in domestic settings,
while the few available industrial datasets are limited to artificial setups
with objects placed on tables. To bridge this gap, we introduce CHIP, the first
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation of chairs manipulated by a robotic arm
in a real-world industrial environment. CHIP includes seven distinct chairs
captured using three different RGBD sensing technologies and presents unique
challenges, such as distractor objects with fine-grained differences and severe
occlusions caused by the robotic arm and human operators. CHIP comprises 77,811
RGBD images annotated with ground-truth 6D poses automatically derived from the
robot's kinematics, averaging 11,115 annotations per chair. We benchmark CHIP
using three zero-shot 6D pose estimation methods, assessing performance across
different sensor types, localization priors, and occlusion levels. Results show
substantial room for improvement, highlighting the unique challenges posed by
the dataset. CHIP will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LADH, a long-term rPPG dataset for non-contact health monitoring, addressing challenges like lighting variations and occlusions. Combining RGB and IR videos improves accuracy, achieving a 4.99 BPM MAE in heart rate estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of rPPG in long-term personal care scenarios (e.g., high-altitude environments) due to lighting changes, occlusions, and dynamic postures.

Method: Developed LADH dataset with synchronized RGB and IR videos, ground-truth PPG, respiration, and blood oxygen signals. Used multi-task learning for improved performance.

Result: Combining RGB and IR inputs reduced heart rate estimation error to 4.99 BPM MAE. Multi-task learning enhanced multiple physiological indicators.

Conclusion: LADH dataset and fusion of RGB-IR inputs improve rPPG robustness for long-term health monitoring, with open-source availability.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring
of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional
health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring,
its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing
routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient
lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic
facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term
Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240
synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across
five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration,
and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR
video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological
monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate
estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance
across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are

TL;DR: A novel cell instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem simplifies instance differentiation by using a four-color encoding scheme, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells in biomedical images is challenging, and existing methods struggle to balance performance and computational efficiency.

Method: The method conceptualizes cells as countries and tissues as oceans, using a four-color encoding scheme to transform instance segmentation into a constrained semantic segmentation problem with four classes. An asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method address training instability.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively simplifies and improves cell instance segmentation, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Cell instance segmentation is critical to analyzing biomedical images, yet
accurately distinguishing tightly touching cells remains a persistent
challenge. Existing instance segmentation frameworks, including
detection-based, contour-based, and distance mapping-based approaches, have
made significant progress, but balancing model performance with computational
efficiency remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel cell
instance segmentation method inspired by the four-color theorem. By
conceptualizing cells as countries and tissues as oceans, we introduce a
four-color encoding scheme that ensures adjacent instances receive distinct
labels. This reformulation transforms instance segmentation into a constrained
semantic segmentation problem with only four predicted classes, substantially
simplifying the instance differentiation process. To solve the training
instability caused by the non-uniqueness of four-color encoding, we design an
asymptotic training strategy and encoding transformation method. Extensive
experiments on various modes demonstrate our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/FCIS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MPFNet, a Multi-Prior Fusion Network for micro-expression recognition, leveraging progressive training and dual encoders to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression recognition is challenging due to brief duration and low intensity. Existing methods use simplistic prior knowledge, missing multi-source information.

Method: MPFNet uses Generic and Advanced Feature Encoders (GFE, AFE) with I3D and Coordinate Attention. Two variants (MPFNet-P, MPFNet-C) mimic infant cognitive development modes.

Result: MPFNet achieves accuracies of 0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, setting state-of-the-art on SMIC and SAMM.

Conclusion: MPFNet effectively integrates multi-source prior knowledge, significantly improving micro-expression recognition performance.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER), a critical subfield of affective
computing, presents greater challenges than macro-expression recognition due to
its brief duration and low intensity. While incorporating prior knowledge has
been shown to enhance MER performance, existing methods predominantly rely on
simplistic, singular sources of prior knowledge, failing to fully exploit
multi-source information. This paper introduces the Multi-Prior Fusion Network
(MPFNet), leveraging a progressive training strategy to optimize MER tasks. We
propose two complementary encoders: the Generic Feature Encoder (GFE) and the
Advanced Feature Encoder (AFE), both based on Inflated 3D ConvNets (I3D) with
Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanisms, to improve the model's ability to capture
spatiotemporal and channel-specific features. Inspired by developmental
psychology, we present two variants of MPFNet--MPFNet-P and
MPFNet-C--corresponding to two fundamental modes of infant cognitive
development: parallel and hierarchical processing. These variants enable the
evaluation of different strategies for integrating prior knowledge. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MPFNet significantly improves MER accuracy while
maintaining balanced performance across categories, achieving accuracies of
0.811, 0.924, and 0.857 on the SMIC, CASME II, and SAMM datasets, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the SMIC and SAMM datasets.

*Yuting Li,Lai Wei,Kaipeng Zheng,Jingyuan Huang,Linghe Kong,Lichao Sun,Weiran Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Language-only models with image captions can match or outperform MLLMs, suggesting MLLMs struggle with visual integration. A visual perturbation framework improves perceptual robustness without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs generate accurate visual descriptions but fail in integrating them during reasoning, prompting the need for enhanced visual processing.

Method: Proposes a visual perturbation framework with three strategies: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup, and random rotation, integrated into post-training pipelines.

Result: Improves mathematical reasoning performance across datasets, achieving competitive results with open-source 7B RL-tuned models.

Conclusion: Visual perturbation is critical for multimodal reasoning, emphasizing 'better reasoning begins with better seeing.'

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they
have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet
revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when
provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance
than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may
generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them
during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation
framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic
modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three
targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,
and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training
pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across
multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical
reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through
algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among
open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual
perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the
effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each
perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual
reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in
multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

*Qin Zhou,Zhiyang Zhang,Jinglong Wang,Xiaobin Li,Jing Zhang,Qian Yu,Lu Sheng,Dong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates text-image alignment in diffusion models using zero-shot referring image segmentation, identifies misalignment causes (small/occluded/rare objects), and proposes ELBO-T2IAlign, a training-free calibration method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods assume perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is unrealistic. The study aims to assess and improve this alignment.

Method: Uses zero-shot referring image segmentation to evaluate alignment, analyzes misalignment causes, and introduces ELBO-T2IAlign for calibration.

Result: Misalignment occurs with small, occluded, or rare objects. ELBO-T2IAlign effectively improves alignment without training.

Conclusion: ELBO-T2IAlign is a simple, generic solution for enhancing pixel-text alignment in diffusion models, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that
these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image
alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This
information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation,
text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current
methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in
diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using
zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the
pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models.
We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models
from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in
images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we
propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text
alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of
likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to
identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various
diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark
datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness
of our proposed calibration approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMHCL, a setting for learning with heterogeneous category sets in multimodal data, and proposes CSCF, a model that aligns features, selects discriminative modalities, and refines predictions using class similarity, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal data often has inconsistent category distributions, limiting effective cross-modal information use for recognition.

Method: Proposes CSCF: aligns features to a shared space, selects discriminative modalities via uncertainty, and refines predictions using class similarity.

Result: CSCF outperforms SOTA methods on benchmark datasets, effectively handling MMHCL.

Conclusion: CSCF successfully addresses MMHCL by leveraging cross-modal information and class similarity, improving recognition across heterogeneous category sets.

Abstract: Existing multimodal methods typically assume that different modalities share
the same category set. However, in real-world applications, the category
distributions in multimodal data exhibit inconsistencies, which can hinder the
model's ability to effectively utilize cross-modal information for recognizing
all categories. In this work, we propose the practical setting termed
Multi-Modal Heterogeneous Category-set Learning (MMHCL), where models are
trained in heterogeneous category sets of multi-modal data and aim to recognize
complete classes set of all modalities during test. To effectively address this
task, we propose a Class Similarity-based Cross-modal Fusion model (CSCF).
Specifically, CSCF aligns modality-specific features to a shared semantic space
to enable knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes. It then selects
the most discriminative modality for decision fusion through uncertainty
estimation. Finally, it integrates cross-modal information based on class
similarity, where the auxiliary modality refines the prediction of the dominant
one. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on multiple benchmark datasets,
effectively addressing the MMHCL task.

*Xiangkai Zhang,Xiang Zhou,Mao Chen,Yuchen Lu,Xu Yang,Zhiyong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a hierarchical cross-source image matching method for UAV absolute localization, combining semantic-aware coarse matching with fine-grained matching to address challenges in GNSS-denied scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Absolute localization for UAVs is challenging without GNSS signals, and existing vision-based methods struggle with cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations.

Method: A hierarchical approach: semantic-aware coarse matching followed by fine-grained matching, integrated into a UAV localization pipeline without relying on relative techniques.

Result: Superior accuracy and robustness demonstrated on benchmark datasets, including a new CS-UAV dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively overcomes limitations of traditional image matching, proving its suitability for UAV absolute localization in GNSS-denied environments.

Abstract: Absolute localization, aiming to determine an agent's location with respect
to a global reference, is crucial for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
various applications, but it becomes challenging when global navigation
satellite system (GNSS) signals are unavailable. Vision-based absolute
localization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference
satellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied
scenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level
image matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences
introduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome
these limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source
image matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates
a semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a
lightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching
module, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first
establish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural
constraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine
features and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV
absolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on
relative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module
before the proposed hierarchical image matching modules. Experimental
evaluations on public benchmark datasets and a newly introduced CS-UAV dataset
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under
various challenging conditions, confirming its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-SAM2 introduces a low-bit quantization method for SAM2, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy, outperforming existing quantization schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2's high computational and memory costs limit its use in resource-constrained scenarios, prompting the need for an efficient solution.

Method: Q-SAM2 uses linear layer calibration for low-bit initialization and a Quantization-Aware Training pipeline to adapt to quantization thresholds.

Result: Q-SAM2 achieves highly accurate inference, especially in ultra-low 2-bit quantization, with a 66% mIoU improvement in post-training quantization.

Conclusion: Q-SAM2 is an effective solution for efficient SAM2 deployment, excelling in both accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a
foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its
expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its
application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an
accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To
address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and
activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel
technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method
for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a
small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.
We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies
clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization
thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving
efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses
existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for
ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training,
our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training
quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over
non-calibrated models.

TL;DR: FreeZeV2 is a training-free method for 6D pose estimation of unseen objects, improving accuracy and efficiency over its predecessor with sparse feature extraction, feature-aware scoring, and modular design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing 6D pose estimation to novel objects without task-specific training, addressing computational inefficiency.

Method: Leverages pre-trained geometric and vision models, sparse feature extraction, feature-aware scoring, and modular segmentation ensembles.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on BOP Benchmark, 8x speedup and 5% accuracy gain over FreeZe; additional 8% accuracy with segmentation ensembles.

Conclusion: FreeZeV2 demonstrates that task-specific training is unnecessary for accurate 6D pose estimation, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD data is a fundamental problem in
computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. A key
challenge is achieving generalization to novel objects that were not seen
during training. Most existing approaches address this by scaling up training
on synthetic data tailored to the task, a process that demands substantial
computational resources. But is task-specific training really necessary for
accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects? To answer No!, we
introduce FreeZeV2, the second generation of FreeZe: a training-free method
that achieves strong generalization to unseen objects by leveraging geometric
and vision foundation models pre-trained on unrelated data. FreeZeV2 improves
both accuracy and efficiency over FreeZe through three key contributions: (i) a
sparse feature extraction strategy that reduces inference-time computation
without sacrificing accuracy; (ii) a feature-aware scoring mechanism that
improves both pose selection during RANSAC-based 3D registration and the final
ranking of pose candidates; and (iii) a modular design that supports ensembles
of instance segmentation models, increasing robustness to segmentation masks
errors. We evaluate FreeZeV2 on the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark,
where it establishes a new state-of-the-art in 6D pose estimation of unseen
objects. When using the same segmentation masks, FreeZeV2 achieves a remarkable
8x speedup over FreeZe while also improving accuracy by 5%. When using
ensembles of segmentation models, FreeZeV2 gains an additional 8% in accuracy
while still running 2.5x faster than FreeZe. FreeZeV2 was awarded Best Overall
Method at the BOP Challenge 2024.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-MeshPref, a large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, and RewardCS, a reward model trained on it. These are integrated into DreamCS, a framework improving text-to-3D generation by aligning outputs with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for text-to-3D generation struggle with human preference alignment and suffer from 2D bias, leading to geometric artifacts.

Method: The authors construct 3D-MeshPref, a dataset annotated by a large language model and refined by humans. They develop RewardCS using a Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective and integrate it into DreamCS for 3D generation.

Result: DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing geometrically faithful and human-preferred 3D assets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach addresses 2D bias and improves human preference alignment in text-to-3D generation, with public release of code and models.

Abstract: While text-to-3D generation has attracted growing interest, existing methods
often struggle to produce 3D assets that align well with human preferences.
Current preference alignment techniques for 3D content typically rely on
hardly-collected preference-paired multi-view 2D images to train 2D reward
models, when then guide 3D generation -- leading to geometric artifacts due to
their inherent 2D bias. To address these limitations, we construct 3D-MeshPref,
the first large-scale unpaired 3D preference dataset, featuring diverse 3D
meshes annotated by a large language model and refined by human evaluators. We
then develop RewardCS, the first reward model trained directly on unpaired
3D-MeshPref data using a novel Cauchy-Schwarz divergence objective, enabling
effective learning of human-aligned 3D geometric preferences without requiring
paired comparisons. Building on this, we propose DreamCS, a unified framework
that integrates RewardCS into text-to-3D pipelines -- enhancing both implicit
and explicit 3D generation with human preference feedback. Extensive
experiments show DreamCS outperforms prior methods, producing 3D assets that
are both geometrically faithful and human-preferred. Code and models will be
released publicly.

*Chuang Maa,Yu Peia,Jianhang Zhanga,Shaokai Zhaoa,Bowen Jib,Liang Xiea,Ye Yana,Erwei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MMME, a novel multimodal dataset for micro-expression (ME) analysis, combining visual and physiological signals to enhance recognition and spotting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ME research is limited to single visual modality, missing rich emotional data from physiological signals, hindering practical applications.

Method: The study develops the MMME dataset, synchronizing facial action signals (MEs), EEG, and peripheral physiological signals (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, ECG) for multimodal fusion.

Result: Experiments show integrating MEs with physiological signals significantly improves recognition and spotting performance.

Conclusion: MMME is the most comprehensive ME dataset to date, enabling a shift from single-modality to multimodal fusion in ME research.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, fleeting nonverbal cues that reveal an
individual's genuine emotional state. Their analysis has attracted considerable
interest due to its promising applications in fields such as healthcare,
criminal investigation, and human-computer interaction. However, existing ME
research is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional
information conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME
recognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.
Therefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual
features and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion
framework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study
introduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables
synchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system
signals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming
the constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841
macro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,
establishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and
conducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the
dataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating
that integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting
performance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME
dataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data
support for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the
visual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME
research from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset

*Junli Deng,Ping Shi,Qipei Li,Jinyang Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaSplat extends Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes by separating static/dynamic elements and using hierarchical motion modeling, achieving superior accuracy and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with real-world dynamic complexity, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Classifies static/dynamic elements via deformation offset statistics and 2D motion flow, uses hierarchical motion modeling, and integrates opacity estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in accuracy, realism, and efficiency.

Conclusion: DynaSplat offers a compact, efficient, and intuitive approach to dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central
ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the
complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that
extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static
separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements
as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics
and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus
precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion
modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and
fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate,
non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to
ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and
perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that
DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and
realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to
dynamic scene reconstruction.

*Chen Gao,Liankai Jin,Xingyu Peng,Jiazhao Zhang,Yue Deng,Annan Li,He Wang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1 to develop generalist navigation agents capable of following free-form, multi-modal instructions, outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify fragmented navigation research by creating a generalist agent that handles diverse tasks and modalities.

Method: Proposes OctoNav-Bench (a benchmark with diverse instruction-trajectory pairs) and OctoNav-R1 (a VLA-type model trained via Hybrid Training Paradigm).

Result: OctoNav-R1 achieves superior performance compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The approach advances generalist navigation by integrating multi-modal capabilities and reasoning, validated by strong results.

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit
of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different
tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task
objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed
individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,
which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of
multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale
benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.
Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed
via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory
pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and
capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within
OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,
we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce
low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a
Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,
Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains
specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT
and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which
show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to
investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation
field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,
we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a
cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.
Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

*Panagiotis Kaliosis,John Pavlopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel loss function using Wasserstein distance improves handwritten text recognition by aligning character frequency distributions, enhancing accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten text recognition faces challenges due to evolving and context-dependent handwriting, leading to underperformance in specific subsets.

Method: Proposes a loss function incorporating Wasserstein distance to penalize divergence from expected character frequency distributions, also using it as a scoring function for guided decoding.

Result: Experimental results show improved generalization and performance across datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses temporal and contextual shifts in handwriting, with open-sourced code for broader use.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into
machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and
context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and
character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,
often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on
specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that
incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency
distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically
derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected
distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under
temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference
time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a
guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and
architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting
generalization and performance. We open source our code at

TL;DR: IntPhys 2 is a video benchmark evaluating deep learning models' intuitive physics understanding, focusing on four core principles. State-of-the-art models struggle, performing at chance levels, unlike humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve deep learning models' intuitive physics understanding, inspired by early childhood development.

Method: Uses a violation of expectation framework in controlled virtual environments to test four principles: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity.

Result: Models perform at chance levels (50%), far below human near-perfect accuracy, revealing a significant gap.

Conclusion: Current models lack human-like intuitive physics understanding, necessitating advancements in architectures and training.

Abstract: We present IntPhys 2, a video benchmark designed to evaluate the intuitive
physics understanding of deep learning models. Building on the original IntPhys
benchmark, IntPhys 2 focuses on four core principles related to macroscopic
objects: Permanence, Immutability, Spatio-Temporal Continuity, and Solidity.
These conditions are inspired by research into intuitive physical understanding
emerging during early childhood. IntPhys 2 offers a comprehensive suite of
tests, based on the violation of expectation framework, that challenge models
to differentiate between possible and impossible events within controlled and
diverse virtual environments. Alongside the benchmark, we provide performance
evaluations of several state-of-the-art models. Our findings indicate that
while these models demonstrate basic visual understanding, they face
significant challenges in grasping intuitive physics across the four principles
in complex scenes, with most models performing at chance levels (50%), in stark
contrast to human performance, which achieves near-perfect accuracy. This
underscores the gap between current models and human-like intuitive physics
understanding, highlighting the need for advancements in model architectures
and training methodologies.

*Siyu Chen,Ting Han,Chengzheng Fu,Changshe Zhang,Chaolei Wang,Jinhe Su,Guorong Cai,Meiliu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vireo introduces a single-stage framework for Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS), unifying OVSS and DGSS to handle unseen categories and domains. It leverages frozen Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) and Depth VFMs, with novel components like GeoText Prompts, CMPE, and DOV-VEH for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OV-DGSS addresses the need for pixel-level segmentation of unseen categories and robustness across unseen domains, crucial for real-world applications like autonomous driving in adverse conditions.

Method: Vireo uses frozen VFMs and Depth VFMs, incorporating GeoText Prompts, CMPE, and DOV-VEH to align visual and textual features and enhance domain-invariant predictions.

Result: Vireo achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in domain generalization and open-vocabulary recognition.

Conclusion: Vireo provides a unified, scalable solution for robust visual understanding in diverse environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of its design.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) and domain generalization in
semantic segmentation (DGSS) highlight a subtle complementarity that motivates
Open-Vocabulary Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation (OV-DGSS). OV-DGSS
aims to generate pixel-level masks for unseen categories while maintaining
robustness across unseen domains, a critical capability for real-world
scenarios such as autonomous driving in adverse conditions. We introduce Vireo,
a novel single-stage framework for OV-DGSS that unifies the strengths of OVSS
and DGSS for the first time. Vireo builds upon the frozen Visual Foundation
Models (VFMs) and incorporates scene geometry via Depth VFMs to extract
domain-invariant structural features. To bridge the gap between visual and
textual modalities under domain shift, we propose three key components: (1)
GeoText Prompts, which align geometric features with language cues and
progressively refine VFM encoder representations; (2) Coarse Mask Prior
Embedding (CMPE) for enhancing gradient flow for faster convergence and
stronger textual influence; and (3) the Domain-Open-Vocabulary Vector Embedding
Head (DOV-VEH), which fuses refined structural and semantic features for robust
prediction. Comprehensive evaluation on these components demonstrates the
effectiveness of our designs. Our proposed Vireo achieves the state-of-the-art
performance and surpasses existing methods by a large margin in both domain
generalization and open-vocabulary recognition, offering a unified and scalable
solution for robust visual understanding in diverse and dynamic environments.

*Seonho Lee,Jiho Choi,Inha Kang,Jiwook Kim,Junsung Park,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight framework, Geometric Distillation, enhances 2D-trained VLMs with 3D spatial understanding using geometric cues, outperforming prior methods with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs lack 3D spatial understanding despite strong performance in visual and linguistic tasks. This work aims to bridge this gap without architectural changes.

Method: Geometric Distillation injects geometric cues (sparse correspondences, relative depth, dense cost volumes) from 3D models into VLMs via fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms prior methods on 3D vision-language reasoning and perception benchmarks, with lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable way to equip VLMs with 3D understanding, expanding their use in spatially grounded tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse
visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their
understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a
lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired
geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By
distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3)
dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R,
VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining
compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D
vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently
outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with
significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and
efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up
wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

*Haoru Wang,Kai Ye,Yangyan Li,Wenzheng Chen,Baoquan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in novel view synthesis (NVS), showing that less reliance on 3D inductive bias and pose annotations improves performance with data scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of inferring 3D structure from sparse or unposed 2D images without per-scene optimization, and to explore the role of 3D knowledge in NVS.

Method: Proposes a framework minimizing 3D inductive bias and pose dependence, learning implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images.

Result: Achieves photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel views, matching performance of methods relying on posed inputs.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of a data-centric paradigm, reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in NVS.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS), which
aims to generate photorealistic novel views from sparse or even unposed 2D
images without per-scene optimization. This task remains fundamentally
challenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and
ambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D
knowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding
explicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and
ground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts
have sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera
poses of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and
the necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:
the performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as
data scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D
knowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of
reducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated
by and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D
inductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By
eliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and
learns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D
inductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel
views, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed
inputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our
data-centric paradigm. Project page:

*Athinoulla Konstantinou,Georgios Leontidis,Mamatha Thota,Aiden Durrant*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EquiCaps, a capsule-based method, leverages intrinsic pose-awareness of capsules for self-supervised learning, outperforming prior equivariant methods in pose estimation without needing a specialized predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore capsule networks' inherent ability for pose-aware representations and eliminate the need for specialized predictors in equivariant learning.

Method: Introduces EquiCaps, a capsule-based approach for pose-aware self-supervision, tested on 3DIEBench-T with multi-geometric transformations.

Result: EquiCaps achieves a supervised-level R² of 0.78 in rotation prediction, outperforming SIE and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 R², respectively.

Conclusion: EquiCaps demonstrates robust equivariant performance under complex transformations, highlighting the potential of predictor-free capsule architectures.

Abstract: Learning self-supervised representations that are invariant and equivariant
to transformations is crucial for advancing beyond traditional visual
classification tasks. However, many methods rely on predictor architectures to
encode equivariance, despite evidence that architectural choices, such as
capsule networks, inherently excel at learning interpretable pose-aware
representations. To explore this, we introduce EquiCaps (Equivariant Capsule
Network), a capsule-based approach to pose-aware self-supervision that
eliminates the need for a specialised predictor for enforcing equivariance.
Instead, we leverage the intrinsic pose-awareness capabilities of capsules to
improve performance in pose estimation tasks. To further challenge our
assumptions, we increase task complexity via multi-geometric transformations to
enable a more thorough evaluation of invariance and equivariance by introducing
3DIEBench-T, an extension of a 3D object-rendering benchmark dataset. Empirical
results demonstrate that EquiCaps outperforms prior state-of-the-art
equivariant methods on rotation prediction, achieving a supervised-level $R^2$
of 0.78 on the 3DIEBench rotation prediction benchmark and improving upon SIE
and CapsIE by 0.05 and 0.04 $R^2$, respectively. Moreover, in contrast to
non-capsule-based equivariant approaches, EquiCaps maintains robust equivariant
performance under combined geometric transformations, underscoring its
generalisation capabilities and the promise of predictor-free capsule
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-FPN-BS addresses the issue of untrained high-level features in Tiny Object Detection by enhancing low-level features with wasted high-level semantics, using a novel architecture with multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard label assignment protocols in feature pyramid networks leave high-level features untrained, creating semantic dead-ends and lacking semantic context in low-level features.

Method: Proposes E-FPN-BS with a Context Enhancement Module (CEM) for global-local fusion and a Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) for dynamic region amplification. Introduces Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss (DCLoss) for scale-aware gradient equilibrium.

Result: Demonstrates outstanding performance and generalization across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: E-FPN-BS effectively resolves the dual deficiencies in feature pyramid networks for tiny object detection.

Abstract: Tiny object detection (TOD) reveals a fundamental flaw in feature pyramid
networks: high-level features (P5-P6) frequently receive zero positive anchors
under standard label assignment protocols, leaving their semantic
representations untrained due to exclusion from loss computation. This creates
dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends
without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic
context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically
converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To
address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating
multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context
Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress
high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the
Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks
that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance
across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss
(DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware
gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our
approach.

*Tilemachos Aravanis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Petros Maragos,George Retsinas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Only-Style is a method to mitigate content leakage in style-consistent image generation by localizing and adaptively tuning style alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle to separate semantic content from style, causing content leakage in style-consistent generation.

Method: Only-Style localizes content leakage during inference and adaptively tunes a parameter for style alignment in specific image patches.

Result: The method achieves robust stylistic consistency without content leakage, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: Only-Style effectively balances style consistency and leakage elimination, with a novel evaluation framework for quantifying success.

Abstract: Generating images in a consistent reference visual style remains a
challenging computer vision task. State-of-the-art methods aiming for
style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content
from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as
a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a
method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner
while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content
leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that
controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches
containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best
balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the
localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a
reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any
method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the
stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to
quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired
content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over
state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,
consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content
leakage.

TL;DR: MetricHMR introduces a method for accurate metric human mesh recovery from monocular images, addressing scale and depth ambiguities in existing HMR methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HMR methods struggle with scale and depth ambiguity, leading to unrealistic reconstructions. MetricHMR aims to provide geometrically accurate results.

Method: The approach uses a standard perspective projection model, analyzes ambiguity ranges, and introduces a ray map to encode bounding-box info, camera parameters, and geometric cues for End2End metric HMR.

Result: MetricHMR achieves state-of-the-art performance in metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation, outperforming sequential HMR methods.

Conclusion: MetricHMR effectively resolves scale and depth ambiguities, providing accurate metric human mesh recovery without additional regularization modules.

Abstract: We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric
human mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In
contrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth
ambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and
global translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first
systematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the
critical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling
metric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR
under the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel
approach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection
to jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric
cues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization
modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in
metric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and
in-the-wild scenarios.

*Jianhan Qi,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel method for hyperspectral image clustering using structural-spectral graph convolution and adaptive edge learning, improving accuracy over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNNs fail to fully utilize spectral information in hyperspectral images, and inaccurate superpixel graphs can confuse class semantics during clustering.

Method: Proposes a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) and an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module, integrated into a contrastive learning framework.

Result: Achieves clustering accuracy improvements of 2.61% to 6.06% over best compared methods on four datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances clustering accuracy by better exploiting spectral information and refining superpixel graphs.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class
without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For
large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform
superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However,
existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI,
and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of
different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these
challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator
(SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their
representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral
features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL)
module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel
topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning
framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering
are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best
compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation, improves quantization for diffusion models by normalizing activations and using Hadamard transformations, reducing quantization error and enhancing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models face high memory and computational demands, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices. Standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers and require aggressive quantization.

Method: HadaNorm normalizes activations feature channels and applies Hadamard transformations before quantization, mitigating outliers and enabling more aggressive compression.

Result: HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across transformer blocks, achieving better efficiency-performance trade-offs than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: HadaNorm effectively addresses quantization challenges in diffusion models, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their
high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained
devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by
reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods
struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires
transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work,
we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing
approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations
feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more
aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently
reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks,
achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between 3D-VL models and 2D counterparts by overcoming data scalability issues and lack of efficient scene representation.

Method: Proposes LEO-VL with CFG for efficient scene representation, trained on 700k 3D-VL data across four domains and five tasks. Introduces SceneDPO for robustness.

Result: Achieves SOTA on benchmarks like SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Confirms efficiency of CFG and importance of diverse data.

Conclusion: LEO-VL advances scalable and robust 3D-VL generalists, with SceneDPO enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Developing 3D-VL generalists capable of understanding 3D scenes and following
natural language instructions to perform a wide range of tasks has been a
long-standing goal in the 3D-VL community. Despite recent progress, 3D-VL
models still lag behind their 2D counterparts in capability and robustness,
falling short of the generalist standard. A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL
generalists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient
scene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed
feature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D
perception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token
overhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL
generalist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four
domains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and
dialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA
benchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the
efficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity,
and the validity of our data curation principle. Furthermore, we introduce
SceneDPO, a novel post-training objective that enhances the robustness of 3D-VL
models. We hope our findings contribute to the advancement of scalable and
robust 3D-VL generalists.

TL;DR: CausalVQA is a new benchmark dataset for video question answering (VQA) focusing on causality in real-world scenarios, challenging models to predict outcomes of actions and events. Current models perform below humans, especially on anticipation and hypothetical questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks lack focus on causality in real-world scenarios, either emphasizing surface perception or narrow physical reasoning in simulations. CausalVQA aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The dataset includes five question types (counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning, descriptive) with quality controls to prevent trivial shortcuts, requiring deep visual understanding.

Result: Current multimodal models perform significantly below human levels, particularly on anticipation and hypothetical questions, indicating gaps in spatial-temporal reasoning and physical understanding.

Conclusion: CausalVQA highlights the challenge for models to leverage deep reasoning and understanding of alternatives for accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering
(VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of
causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus
on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical
reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an
important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in
real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely
outcomes of different actions and events through five question types:
counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We
designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial
shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding
instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models
fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on
anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for
current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of
physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make
accurate predictions in real-world settings.

*Ziyi Wang,Yanran Zhang,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPre3D is the first unified pre-training method for point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any architecture, using Gaussian primitives and differentiable rendering for pixel-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scale diversity in point cloud data and the lack of unified 3D models for object- and scene-level tasks.

Method: Predicts Gaussian primitives, employs differentiable Gaussian splatting for rendering, and integrates 2D features from pre-trained image models for texture knowledge.

Result: Validated through extensive experiments across object- and scene-level tasks, showing universal effectiveness.

Conclusion: UniPre3D provides a scalable and architecture-agnostic solution for unified 3D representation learning.

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in
developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently,
there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally
effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we
introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be
seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any
architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training
task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling
precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further
regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus
toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image
models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the
universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments
across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud
models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

*Benjamin Reichman,Constantin Patsch,Jack Truxal,Atishay Jain,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dataset for visually grounded dialogue requiring external knowledge is introduced, with baselines and challenges outlined.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend OK-VQA to a conversational setting with videos, addressing the need for integrating visual and external knowledge over time.

Method: Creation of a dataset with 2,017 videos and 5,986 dialogues (40,954 turns), where questions require external knowledge not in the visuals.

Result: Baseline models are provided, highlighting the task's complexity in combining visual and external knowledge.

Conclusion: The dataset and baselines pave the way for future research in visually grounded dialogue with external knowledge.

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must
identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external
knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a
visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must
both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where
the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information.
Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the
subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of
$2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$
interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in
specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that
is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant
video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the
dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and
show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly
available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field.
First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks.
Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing
research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their
performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a

and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application
scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and
offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing MedVQA datasets, which lack clinical complexity and visual diversity, to improve AI systems for clinical use.

Method: Systematic generation of QA pairs using large language models, stratified by complexity, and visual augmentations mimicking real-world artifacts.

Result: A dataset supporting two evaluation tracks: standard VQA performance and robustness against visual perturbations.

Conclusion: Kvasir-VQA-x1 provides a challenging, clinically relevant benchmark to advance reliable multimodal AI for clinical settings, adhering to FAIR principles.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising field for
developing clinical decision support systems, yet progress is often limited by
the available datasets, which can lack clinical complexity and visual
diversity. To address these gaps, we introduce Kvasir-VQA-x1, a new,
large-scale dataset for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. Our work significantly
expands upon the original Kvasir-VQA by incorporating 159,549 new
question-answer pairs that are designed to test deeper clinical reasoning. We
developed a systematic method using large language models to generate these
questions, which are stratified by complexity to better assess a model's
inference capabilities. To ensure our dataset prepares models for real-world
clinical scenarios, we have also introduced a variety of visual augmentations
that mimic common imaging artifacts. The dataset is structured to support two
main evaluation tracks: one for standard VQA performance and another to test
model robustness against these visual perturbations. By providing a more
challenging and clinically relevant benchmark, Kvasir-VQA-x1 aims to accelerate
the development of more reliable and effective multimodal AI systems for use in
clinical settings. The dataset is fully accessible and adheres to FAIR data
principles, making it a valuable resource for the wider research community.

### [92] [Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Interwoven Thinking and Visual Drawing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09965)
*Junfei Wu,Jian Guan,Kaituo Feng,Qiang Liu,Shu Wu,Liang Wang,Wei Wu,Tieniu Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VILASR, a novel paradigm for multimodal reasoning in LVLMs using drawing operations to enhance spatial reasoning, outperforming existing methods by 18.4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning methods are text-centric and struggle with spatial tasks requiring geometric understanding. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by enabling visual manipulation through drawing.

Method: The approach involves equipping LVLMs with drawing operations (e.g., bounding boxes, auxiliary lines) and a three-stage training framework: cold-start training, reflective rejection sampling, and reinforcement learning.

Result: VILASR achieves an average 18.4% improvement over existing methods in diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, including maze navigation and multi-view reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed drawing-based reasoning paradigm effectively addresses spatial reasoning limitations in LVLMs, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced
significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,
text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted
purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal
input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in
spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and
continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental
visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing
to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through
elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with
basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing
auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships
through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling
imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning
approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training
framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing
abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,
and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms
existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze
navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and
multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to create stroke-by-stroke artwork evolution, addressing gaps in current systems by incorporating semantic guidance and sequential rendering for better artistic alignment and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the emotional and educational gap between static artwork and its creation process, and improve stroke-based painting systems by aligning strokes with artistic principles.

Method: An image-to-painting approach with semantic guidance for targeted regions, computation of brush stroke parameters, and sequential rendering of segments and strokes.

Result: The method produces high-fidelity paintings with superior stroke quality, aligning with region-based strategies across various input types.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances stroke-based painting by integrating semantic guidance and sequential rendering, achieving better artistic alignment and quality.

Abstract: Creating a stroke-by-stroke evolution process of a visual artwork tries to
bridge the emotional and educational gap between the finished static artwork
and its creation process. Recent stroke-based painting systems focus on
capturing stroke details by predicting and iteratively refining stroke
parameters to maximize the similarity between the input image and the rendered
output. However, these methods often struggle to produce stroke compositions
that align with artistic principles and intent. To address this, we explore an
image-to-painting method that (i) facilitates semantic guidance for brush
strokes in targeted regions, (ii) computes the brush stroke parameters, and
(iii) establishes a sequence among segments and strokes to sequentially render
the final painting. Experimental results on various input image types, such as
face images, paintings, and photographic images, show that our method aligns
with a region-based painting strategy while rendering a painting with high
fidelity and superior stroke quality.

TL;DR: Proposes a part-level 3D object generation framework from a single image, enabling editable parts with a dual volume packing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods generate fused meshes, limiting part-level editing; varying part counts pose a challenge.

Method: End-to-end framework using dual volume packing to organize parts into complementary volumes for complete, interleaved assembly.

Result: Achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than prior image-based part-level methods.

Conclusion: The framework advances part-level 3D generation, enabling editable and semantically meaningful parts.

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D object generation has greatly improved both the quality
and efficiency. However, most existing methods generate a single mesh with all
parts fused together, which limits the ability to edit or manipulate individual
parts. A key challenge is that different objects may have a varying number of
parts. To address this, we propose a new end-to-end framework for part-level 3D
object generation. Given a single input image, our method generates
high-quality 3D objects with an arbitrary number of complete and semantically
meaningful parts. We introduce a dual volume packing strategy that organizes
all parts into two complementary volumes, allowing for the creation of complete
and interleaved parts that assemble into the final object. Experiments show
that our model achieves better quality, diversity, and generalization than
previous image-based part-level generation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReSim, a controllable world model for simulating diverse driving scenarios, including hazardous behaviors, by combining real-world and simulator data. It improves fidelity, controllability, and planning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing driving world models rely on safe expert trajectories, limiting their ability to simulate hazardous or non-expert behaviors. This restricts their use in tasks like policy evaluation.

Method: The authors enrich real-world data with non-expert simulator data (e.g., CARLA) and train a controllable world model using a diffusion transformer architecture. They introduce strategies for better conditioning and controllability.

Result: ReSim achieves 44% higher visual fidelity, over 50% better controllability for expert and non-expert actions, and improves planning and policy selection by 2% and 25%, respectively.

Conclusion: ReSim bridges the gap between simulation and real-world applications, enabling reliable simulation of diverse driving scenarios and enhancing policy evaluation.

Abstract: How can we reliably simulate future driving scenarios under a wide range of
ego driving behaviors? Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on
real-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle
to follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This
limitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In
this work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human
demonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator
(e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this
heterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion
transformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate
conditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The
resulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world
driving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones.
To close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require
reward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module
that estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future. Our ReSim paradigm
achieves up to 44% higher visual fidelity, improves controllability for both
expert and non-expert actions by over 50%, and boosts planning and policy
selection performance on NAVSIM by 2% and 25%, respectively.

Motivation: Challenges in 4D content creation include modeling spatio-temporal distributions and lack of training data.

Method: Leverages DyMeshVAE for compressing/reconstructing dynamic meshes and Rectified Flow for text-conditional generation.

Result: Generates accurate, coherent animations quickly, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Advances 4D content creation accessibility; data, code, and models will be open-released.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D content generation have attracted increasing attention,
yet creating high-quality animated 3D models remains challenging due to the
complexity of modeling spatio-temporal distributions and the scarcity of 4D
training data. In this paper, we present AnimateAnyMesh, the first feed-forward
framework that enables efficient text-driven animation of arbitrary 3D meshes.
Our approach leverages a novel DyMeshVAE architecture that effectively
compresses and reconstructs dynamic mesh sequences by disentangling spatial and
temporal features while preserving local topological structures. To enable
high-quality text-conditional generation, we employ a Rectified Flow-based
training strategy in the compressed latent space. Additionally, we contribute
the DyMesh Dataset, containing over 4M diverse dynamic mesh sequences with text
annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates
semantically accurate and temporally coherent mesh animations in a few seconds,
significantly outperforming existing approaches in both quality and efficiency.
Our work marks a substantial step forward in making 4D content creation more
accessible and practical. All the data, code, and models will be open-released.

*Zhenzhi Wang,Jiaqi Yang,Jianwen Jiang,Chao Liang,Gaojie Lin,Zerong Zheng,Ceyuan Yang,Dahua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for multi-concept human animation with precise, region-specific control of multi-modal conditions, addressing limitations of single-subject methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack precise control for multiple concepts and interactions in videos, limiting applications.

Method: The proposed framework uses a mask predictor to infer layout and aligns local audio conditions iteratively for multi-concept videos.

Result: Empirical results show the framework's effectiveness in generating high-quality, controllable multi-concept videos.

Conclusion: The explicit layout control outperforms implicit methods, enabling better multi-modal condition handling.

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,
image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,
most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions
in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in
the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object
interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control
of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders
applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and
introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of
conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given
reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer
layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues
between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we
inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure
layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the
high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.
Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our
explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit
counterparts and other existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark to assess video-language models' physical understanding, mitigating shortcut solutions by using minimal-change pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are prone to score inflation due to superficial cues, necessitating a more accurate assessment method.

Method: MVP includes 55K multiple-choice QA examples with minimal-change pairs to prevent reliance on biases.

Result: Human performance is 92.9%, while the best model achieves 40.2% (random: 25%).

Conclusion: MVP effectively evaluates true spatio-temporal reasoning, exposing models relying on shortcuts.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for assessing the spatio-temporal understanding and
reasoning abilities of video language models are susceptible to score inflation
due to the presence of shortcut solutions based on superficial visual or
textual cues. This paper mitigates the challenges in accurately assessing model
performance by introducing the Minimal Video Pairs (MVP) benchmark, a simple
shortcut-aware video QA benchmark for assessing the physical understanding of
video language models. The benchmark is comprised of 55K high-quality
multiple-choice video QA examples focusing on physical world understanding.
Examples are curated from nine video data sources, spanning first-person
egocentric and exocentric videos, robotic interaction data, and cognitive
science intuitive physics benchmarks. To mitigate shortcut solutions that rely
on superficial visual or textual cues and biases, each sample in MVP has a
minimal-change pair -- a visually similar video accompanied by an identical
question but an opposing answer. To answer a question correctly, a model must
provide correct answers for both examples in the minimal-change pair; as such,
models that solely rely on visual or textual biases would achieve below random
performance. Human performance on MVP is 92.9\%, while the best open-source
state-of-the-art video-language model achieves 40.2\% compared to random
performance at 25\%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Symbolic Graph Ranker (SGR), a method combining text-based and graph-based approaches using LLMs to model session search interactions, outperforming benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current session search methods overlook graph structures or generalize document representations, missing word-level semantics. SGR aims to bridge this gap by leveraging LLMs.

Method: SGR converts session graphs into text using symbolic grammar rules, then enhances LLMs' graph understanding via self-supervised tasks like link prediction and node generation.

Result: Experiments on AOL and Tiangong-ST datasets show SGR's superiority, confirming its effectiveness in capturing topological information.

Conclusion: SGR bridges traditional search strategies with modern LLMs, offering a novel methodology for session search.

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

TL;DR: EditInspector is a benchmark for evaluating text-guided image edits, revealing current models' limitations and proposing improved methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of text-guided image editing necessitates a framework to verify and assess edit quality.

Method: Introduces EditInspector, a benchmark using human annotations, and evaluates SoTA models across multiple dimensions.

Result: Current models struggle with comprehensive evaluation and hallucinate in descriptions; proposed methods outperform them.

Conclusion: EditInspector highlights gaps in current models and offers superior solutions for artifact detection and difference captioning.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to predict sounds of human hands interacting with 3D scenes using rectified flow models, trained on action-sound pairs, achieving realistic audio outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable interactive 3D scene reconstructions by predicting sounds of physical interactions, enhancing realism and user experience.

Method: Record videos of hand manipulations, train a rectified flow model on action-sound pairs, and query the model for sound predictions based on hand poses.

Result: Generated sounds accurately reflect material properties and actions, often indistinguishable from real sounds.

Conclusion: The approach successfully predicts realistic interaction sounds, advancing interactive 3D scene applications.

Abstract: We study the problem of making 3D scene reconstructions interactive by asking
the following question: can we predict the sounds of human hands physically
interacting with a scene? First, we record a video of a human manipulating
objects within a 3D scene using their hands. We then use these action-sound
pairs to train a rectified flow model to map 3D hand trajectories to their
corresponding audio. At test time, a user can query the model for other
actions, parameterized as sequences of hand poses, to estimate their
corresponding sounds. In our experiments, we find that our generated sounds
accurately convey material properties and actions, and that they are often
indistinguishable to human observers from real sounds. Project page:

TL;DR: The paper introduces Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR) to address text-image hallucination in diffusion-based methods, proposing a multi-task framework (TeReDiff) and a benchmark (SA-Text) for improved text fidelity and visual recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based restoration methods struggle with accurately reconstructing text in degraded images, often producing incorrect text-like patterns.

Method: Proposes TeReDiff, a multi-task diffusion framework integrating diffusion model features with a text-spotting module, and introduces the SA-Text benchmark for training.

Result: TeReDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving text recognition accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses text-image hallucination, enhancing both visual and textual fidelity in image restoration.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization in controlling human movements and modeling diverse scenarios consistently.

Conclusion: PlayerOne pioneers egocentric real-world simulation, opening new possibilities for world modeling and applications.

Abstract: We introduce PlayerOne, the first egocentric realistic world simulator,
facilitating immersive and unrestricted exploration within vividly dynamic
environments. Given an egocentric scene image from the user, PlayerOne can
accurately construct the corresponding world and generate egocentric videos
that are strictly aligned with the real scene human motion of the user captured
by an exocentric camera. PlayerOne is trained in a coarse-to-fine pipeline that
first performs pretraining on large-scale egocentric text-video pairs for
coarse-level egocentric understanding, followed by finetuning on synchronous
motion-video data extracted from egocentric-exocentric video datasets with our
automatic construction pipeline. Besides, considering the varying importance of
different components, we design a part-disentangled motion injection scheme,
enabling precise control of part-level movements. In addition, we devise a
joint reconstruction framework that progressively models both the 4D scene and
video frames, ensuring scene consistency in the long-form video generation.
Experimental results demonstrate its great generalization ability in precise
control of varying human movements and worldconsistent modeling of diverse
scenarios. It marks the first endeavor into egocentric real-world simulation
and can pave the way for the community to delve into fresh frontiers of world
modeling and its diverse applications.

### [104] [Robot-Gated Interactive Imitation Learning with Adaptive Intervention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09176)
*Haoyuan Cai,Zhenghao Peng,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIM is a robot-gated IIL algorithm that reduces human intervention by learning an adaptive criterion for requesting demonstrations, improving efficiency and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IIL methods impose high cognitive demands on human supervisors, necessitating a more adaptive approach.

Method: AIM uses a proxy Q-function to mimic human intervention rules, adjusting requests based on action alignment between agent and human.

Result: AIM reduces expert monitoring efforts by 40% compared to Thrifty-DAgger and improves learning efficiency and demonstration quality.

Conclusion: AIM effectively reduces human intervention, enhances learning, and identifies safety-critical states, making IIL more practical.

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired
behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high
cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention
Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive
criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function
to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on
the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when
the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent
becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the
real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our
expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert
monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to
the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40%
improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency.
Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert
assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and
reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed. Code and demo
video are available at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM.

*C. Opus,A. Lawsen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper critiques Shojaee et al.'s findings on LRMs' "accuracy collapse," attributing it to flawed experimental design rather than inherent reasoning failures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misconceptions about LRMs' reasoning capabilities due to experimental artifacts in prior work.

Method: Analyzes three key issues in the original study: token limits, misclassification in evaluation, and unsolvable benchmarks. Tests models with corrected designs.

Result: Preliminary experiments show high accuracy on previously failed tasks when experimental flaws are controlled.

Conclusion: Careful experimental design is crucial for accurately evaluating AI reasoning.

Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit
"accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds.
We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design
limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals
three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed
model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly
acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated
evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and
practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3)
Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically
impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models
are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we
control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions
instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple
models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported
as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful
experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ming-Omni is a unified multimodal model for processing images, text, audio, and video, excelling in speech and image generation without task-specific adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a single model that efficiently handles diverse multimodal tasks, eliminating the need for separate models or redesigns.

Method: Uses dedicated encoders and a MoE architecture (Ling) with modality-specific routers to process and fuse multimodal inputs. Includes advanced audio and image decoders for generation tasks.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in unified perception and generation across modalities, matching GPT-4o in capability.

Conclusion: Ming-Omni is a powerful, open-source solution for multimodal tasks, encouraging further research and development.

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing
images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both
speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract
tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE
architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This
design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs
within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without
requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign.
Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by
supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration
of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for
high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in
context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct
versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a
powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities.
Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of
to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights
to encourage further research and development in the community.

*Kehan Zheng,Jinfeng Zhou,Hongning Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit human-like bounded rationality in strategic games but apply heuristics more rigidly and lack dynamic sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare LLMs and humans in strategic decision-making, focusing on deviations from rationality in games like Rock-Paper-Scissors and Prisoner's Dilemma.

Method: Experimental paradigms from behavioral game theory, testing LLMs in identical conditions as humans.

Result: LLMs replicate human heuristics but rigidly, with weaker adaptability to dynamic game changes.

Conclusion: Current LLMs partially mimic human bounded rationality; future training needs to enhance flexibility and context awareness.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making
settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full
rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental
paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on
two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's
Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational
play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions,
we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality
characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human
heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation
when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly
and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game
environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures
in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find
effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that
current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and
highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent
modeling and stronger context awareness.

TL;DR: The paper critiques the push for fully autonomous AI agents, advocating instead for LLM-based Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS) where AI collaborates with humans for better reliability and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Questioning the reliability and transparency of autonomous AI systems, the paper emphasizes the need for AI to work alongside humans to meet actual human requirements.

Method: Proposes LLM-HAS, where humans provide guidance and control, supported by examples from healthcare, finance, and software development.

Result: Demonstrates that human-AI collaboration outperforms autonomous AI in handling complex tasks, offering practical solutions for implementation.

Conclusion: Argues AI progress should focus on enhancing human capabilities through partnership, not autonomy, for a more promising future.

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers
to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions
whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems
still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the
actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based
Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing
them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and
maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking
at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how
human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We
also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer
practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be
measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with
humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human
roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful
partnership.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Fast-MCTD improves the efficiency of MCTD by enabling parallel rollouts and reducing rollout length, achieving up to 100x speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD, while effective, suffers from high computational overhead due to sequential tree search and iterative denoising.

Method: Fast-MCTD integrates Parallel MCTD (parallel rollouts with delayed updates) and Sparse MCTD (trajectory coarsening).

Result: Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over MCTD and outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks.

Conclusion: Fast-MCTD is a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory
planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their
effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently
proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by
combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis
shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential
nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we
propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of
MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD
integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via
delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which
reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that
Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or
improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in
inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and
yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and
scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

TL;DR: DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent, simplifies Diplomacy's complex action assignments and outperforms traditional methods with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI methods for Diplomacy require extensive computational resources. LLMs offer a promising alternative but face challenges due to the game's complexity.

Method: DipLLM uses an autoregressive framework to break down multi-unit actions into simpler unit-level decisions, fine-tuned with minimal data.

Result: DipLLM surpasses the state-of-the-art Cicero model's performance using only 1.5% of its required data.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned LLMs like DipLLM show great potential for complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and
competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods
rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which
demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer
a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong
performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to
Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action
combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address
this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns
equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive
factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action
assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium
policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model
using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model,
surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned
LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to Agentic AI and complex multi-agent systems raises situational and systemic risks, necessitating alignment of AI goals with human values and societal norms.

Method: The paper hierarchically organizes value principles, categorizes agent system scenarios, and systematically reviews evaluation datasets and methods, including multi-agent coordination.

Result: The review provides a structured approach to value alignment, covering principles, scenarios, and evaluation, while identifying gaps in multi-agent coordination.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the importance of value alignment in AI agents and suggests future research directions to address emerging challenges in this field.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the
Agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single
agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making
and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to
increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant
attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an
agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal
norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific
application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large
models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value
principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment
evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a
top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system
application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific
viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets
for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods.
Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within
agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in
this field.

*Eltayeb Ahmed,Uljad Berdica,Martha Elliott,Danijela Horak,Jakob N. Foerster*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Intent Factored Generation (IFG) improves diversity in LLM outputs by sampling intents first, then responses, balancing diversity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for diversity in LLM outputs are token-level, leading to repetitive or unengaging results, especially in reasoning and conversational tasks.

Method: IFG splits sampling into two stages: sampling a diverse intent (high temperature) and generating a coherent response (low temperature). It also integrates intent prompts for reasoning tasks.

Result: IFG improves pass@k and RL from verifier feedback in math/code tasks, enhances conversational diversity without losing reward, and maintains quality in general language tasks.

Conclusion: IFG is a simple, effective method to boost LLM output diversity while preserving performance, easily integrable into existing algorithms.

Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large
Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods
for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing
the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on
reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To
address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the
sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,
e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning
on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us
to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual
diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the
outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting
the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought
before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate
our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method
improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths
and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference
Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.
Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of
generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader
comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we
present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while
maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt
and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into
many algorithms for gains across various applications.

*Stylianos Loukas Vasileiou,Antonio Rago,Maria Vanina Martinez,William Yeoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: People prefer explanation-based belief revisions, diverging from classical theory, which has implications for AI-human alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand human belief revision patterns for better AI-human reasoning alignment.

Method: Three user studies examining how people revise beliefs with explanations, either provided or self-formulated.

Result: Consistent preference for explanation-based, non-minimal revisions across scenarios.

Conclusion: AI systems should adopt explanation-based belief revision operators to align with human cognition.

Abstract: Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of AI learning to understand and act by observation, leveraging large-scale video data and minimal interaction data.

Method: Pre-train V-JEPA 2 on 1M+ hours of video, align it with a language model, and post-train V-JEPA 2-AC on robot videos for planning tasks.

Result: Strong performance in motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy), action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5), and video QA (84.0 on PerceptionTest). Zero-shot robotic planning success without task-specific training.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning with web-scale data and minimal robot interaction enables effective world modeling and planning.

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn
to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach
that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data
(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,
and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free
joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset
comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong
performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something
v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7
recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.
Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering
tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on
TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to
robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world
model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the
Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different
labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.
Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these
environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work
demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small
amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in
the physical world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A meta-learning approach with soft prompts and an attention-mapper module improves few-shot learning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), outperforming in-context learning (ICL) and prompt-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistent ICL performance in smaller LMMs due to overwhelming image embeddings.

Method: Meta-learning with distilled soft prompts and an attention-mapper module for task adaptation.

Result: Outperforms ICL and prompt-tuning on VL-ICL Bench, even under image perturbations.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances few-shot capabilities and reasoning in LMMs.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to
perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance,
especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve
monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to
the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image
embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we
propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing
few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are
distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time
using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an
attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA
v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task
adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps.
Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms
ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations,
improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-as-a-judge approaches focus on numerical scores, lacking qualitative insights for improving NLG systems.

Method: The approach involves open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering using a cumulative algorithm, evaluated with ~300 annotations from 12 NLG datasets.

Result: The method correctly identifies instance-specific issues in 2/3 cases and produces reports similar to human annotators.

Conclusion: LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge effectively provides qualitative feedback for NLG system improvement, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as
LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language
generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with
numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main
output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system
outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful
insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of
two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of
the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also
introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300
annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that
LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3
cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports
composed by human annotators. Our code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: A phrase dictionary biasing method improves speech translation by leveraging phrase mappings, outperforming phrase list biasing by 21% and enhancing multimodal models by 85% in phrase recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phrases are crucial in conversations but rare in training data, making their correct translation challenging in speech tasks.

Method: Proposes a phrase dictionary biasing method, applied to a streaming speech translation model and a multimodal large language model.

Result: Outperforms phrase list biasing by 21% for streaming models and achieves 85% relative improvement in phrase recall for multimodal models.

Conclusion: The phrase dictionary biasing method effectively enhances translation accuracy for rare phrases in speech and multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations.
However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of
phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a
phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the
source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing
method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming
speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental
results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list

*Bruno Ferenc Šegedin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how generative CNNs generalize phonotactic rules from raw audio, testing a narrow FC bottleneck and proposing a novel probing technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if DNNs can generalize phonotactic rules beyond lexical learning and the impact of FC bottleneck size.

Method: Train generative CNNs on raw audio waveforms, shrink the FC bottleneck to 8 channels, and probe generalizations by bypassing the FC with randomized feature maps.

Result: Convolutional layers generalize phonetic dependencies independently of lexical constraints, even with a narrow FC bottleneck.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that CNNs can dynamically generalize phonotactic rules, proposing a new probing technique for such generalizations.

Abstract: The ability of deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent phonotactic
generalizations derived from lexical learning remains an open question. This
study (1) investigates the lexically-invariant generalization capacity of
generative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on raw audio waveforms
of lexical items and (2) explores the consequences of shrinking the
fully-connected layer (FC) bottleneck from 1024 channels to 8 before training.
Ultimately, a novel technique for probing a model's lexically-independent
generalizations is proposed that works only under the narrow FC bottleneck:
generating audio outputs by bypassing the FC and inputting randomized feature
maps into the convolutional block. These outputs are equally biased by a
phonotactic restriction in training as are outputs generated with the FC. This
result shows that the convolutional layers can dynamically generalize phonetic
dependencies beyond lexically-constrained configurations learned by the FC.

*Ziyang Cai,Nayoung Lee,Avi Schwarzschild,Samet Oymak,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers can generalize from shorter to longer inputs by transferring knowledge from related tasks, suggesting reusable computational structures aid extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer models generalize to longer, unseen inputs by exploring task association and transfer of generalization capabilities.

Method: Investigate length generalization through task association, training models with longer auxiliary tasks to observe transfer to target tasks. Tested on algorithmic tasks like arithmetic, string transformations, and maze navigation.

Result: Models generalize better when trained with related longer tasks, and pretrained models show similar transfer effects. Attention head reuse correlates with transfer.

Conclusion: Transformers reuse inductive structures across tasks, enabling length generalization. Pretraining provides reusable scaffolding for downstream extrapolation.

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization
capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained
understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate
length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer
inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length
generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is,
training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to
generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We
demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic
tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze
navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization
capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe
similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that
pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that
facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial
mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the
re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings
deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution
inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across
tasks.

### [120] [Self-Anchored Attention Model for Sample-Efficient Classification of Prosocial Text Chat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09259)
*Zhuofang Li,Rafal Kocielnik,Fereshteh Soltani,Penphob,Boonyarungsrit,Animashree Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to detect and classify prosocial behaviors in online game chats using unsupervised discovery and a novel Self-Anchored Attention Model (SAAM), improving performance by 7.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research focused on toxic content, but prosocial communication is equally important for moderation and fostering positive interactions. Limited datasets and models exist for prosocial behavior detection.

Method: Combined unsupervised discovery with game domain expert collaboration to identify prosocial behaviors. Proposed SAAM, leveraging the entire training set as anchors to improve performance with scarce data.

Result: SAAM achieved a 7.9% improvement over existing techniques. The method was successfully applied to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: This research pioneers NLP for prosocial behavior classification in game chats, shifting moderation focus from penalizing toxicity to encouraging positive interactions.

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating
through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small
volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the
importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as
identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its
analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited
datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in
game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with
game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player
behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention
Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing
technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help
improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach
led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial
behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where
large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one
of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern
Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying
NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game
chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely
penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online
platforms.

*Milan Bhan,Jean-Noel Vittaut,Nicolas Chesneau,Sarath Chandar,Marie-Jeanne Lesot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for measuring the faithfulness of LLM-generated self-NLE by comparing them with interpretations of the model's internal hidden states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating self-NLE faithfulness lack examination of neural activity, leading to unfaithful explanations.

Method: Introduces a flexible framework comparing self-NLE with interpretations of the model's internal hidden states.

Result: Provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by linking explanations to model reasoning.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and aids in generating more faithful explanations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated the capability of generating
free text self Natural Language Explanation (self-NLE) to justify their
answers. Despite their logical appearance, self-NLE do not necessarily reflect
the LLM actual decision-making process, making such explanations unfaithful.
While existing methods for measuring self-NLE faithfulness mostly rely on
behavioral tests or computational block identification, none of them examines
the neural activity underlying the model's reasoning. This work introduces a
novel flexible framework for quantitatively measuring the faithfulness of
LLM-generated self-NLE by directly comparing the latter with interpretations of
the model's internal hidden states. The proposed framework is versatile and
provides deep insights into self-NLE faithfulness by establishing a direct
connection between self-NLE and model reasoning. This approach advances the
understanding of self-NLE faithfulness and provides building blocks for
generating more faithful self-NLE.

*Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano,David Austin,Pablo Piantanida,Jackie Chi Kit Cheung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces $(RSA)^2$, a framework for interpreting figurative language by modeling rhetorical strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on irony interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with figurative language due to mismatched literal and intended meanings, requiring setting-specific motivation modeling.

Method: The $(RSA)^2$ framework extends RSA by incorporating rhetorical strategies, avoiding explicit motivation modeling.

Result: $(RSA)^2$ achieves top performance on the PragMega+ irony dataset, especially when combined with LLMs.

Conclusion: The $(RSA)^2$ framework effectively interprets figurative language without needing to model speaker motivations, advancing probabilistic pragmatics.

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in
human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended
meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which
explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of
probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to
account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations
for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a
setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware
RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a
speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables
human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a
speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony
interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

TL;DR: The paper improves AD detection using Mistral-7B, boosting accuracy by 3.33% over existing methods and 6.35% over ADReSS 2020 benchmarks, with interpretable decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Alzheimer's dementia (AD) detection by leveraging large language models for better accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Extends the paired perplexity approach using Mistral-7B, analyzes decision boundaries, and compares model-generated responses to human ones.

Result: Improved accuracy (3.33% over current methods, 6.35% over ADReSS 2020) and interpretable AD detection.

Conclusion: The approach effectively detects AD, learns language patterns, and offers potential for model interpretation and data augmentation.

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive
decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired
perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model
(LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by
an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35%
over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our
further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect
AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other
methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by
prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to
human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language
patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of
model interpretation and data augmentation.

### [124] [Towards Efficient and Effective Alignment of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09329)
*Yuxin Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel methodologies for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations, focusing on data collection, training, and evaluation. Key contributions include Lion for adversarial distillation, WebR for automated data synthesis, LTE for knowledge integration, BMC for preference optimization, and FollowBench for constraint adherence evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs efficiently and effectively with human expectations is a critical challenge, as existing methods rely on manual curation or proprietary models, limiting scalability and diversity.

Method: Proposes Lion (adversarial distillation), WebR (automated data synthesis), LTE (meta-learning for knowledge updates), BMC (token-level preference optimization), and FollowBench (constraint adherence benchmark).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning, improves data diversity and scalability, enhances knowledge integration, and exposes weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence.

Conclusion: The introduced frameworks and benchmarks significantly advance LLM alignment, offering scalable, diverse, and effective solutions while highlighting areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across diverse
tasks, yet aligning them efficiently and effectively with human expectations
remains a critical challenge. This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing
novel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first
address alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually
curated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines
training data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling
state-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web
Reconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes
instruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly
improving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.
Next, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We
develop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently
integrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages
meta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.
Furthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a
refinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures
token-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment
across QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of
evaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but
overlook adherence to specific constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FollowBench, a multi-level, fine-grained benchmark assessing LLMs' ability to
follow complex constraints across diverse instruction types. Our results expose
key weaknesses in current models' constraint adherence, offering insights for
future improvements.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can model and reason about others' intentions (theory of mind) using cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding intentions is key for collaboration, and the study aims to enhance AI's ability to cooperate with humans and other agents.

Method: Investigates theory of mind in LLMs via cooperative MARL, using LLM-based agents for natural language interaction.

Result: The approach seeks to improve artificial agents' adaptability and cooperation in hybrid human-AI systems.

Conclusion: The work has broad implications for advancing seamless human-artificial interaction.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot
generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling
their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as
translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of
text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the
underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question:
can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess
a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for
effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is
essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans
and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs
through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human
social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to
adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging
LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards
creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with
broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

TL;DR: RePO improves RL for LLMs by using replay strategies to enhance data efficiency and performance, outperforming GRPO with higher gains and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high computational costs and low data efficiency of GRPO in RL for LLMs.

Method: Introduces Replay-Enhanced Policy Optimization (RePO), leveraging off-policy samples from a replay buffer for diverse policy optimization.

Result: RePO achieves significant performance gains (18.4 and 4.1 points for two models) over GRPO, with a 48% increase in effective optimization steps.

Conclusion: RePO is a computationally efficient and effective method for RL in LLMs, demonstrated by superior performance and efficiency metrics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models
(LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages
using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational
costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced
Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to
retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization
based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments
on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further
analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while
raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B,
with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository

TL;DR: The study explores latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, showing MLA+RoPE with half-rank dimensions reduces memory by 45% with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate efficiency-quality trade-offs in small language models using MLA variants.

Method: Training 30M-parameter GPT models on synthetic stories, comparing MHA, MLA, and MLA+RoPE.

Result: MLA+RoPE (r=d/2) cuts KV-cache memory by 45% with only 0.3% higher validation loss, outperforming vanilla attention by 2%.

Conclusion: MLA+RoPE offers a Pareto improvement for memory-constrained deployment, with RoPE being crucial for performance in small models.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA)
for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs.
Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark
three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA
with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE
with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory
reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially
matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment.
We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA
underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by
2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2
achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory
savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving
the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency
metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: OmniDRCA is a parallel speech-text foundation model using joint autoregressive modeling, dual-resolution speech representations, and contrastive cross-modal alignment, achieving SOTA performance in speech-text tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing methods that either ignore speech-text interaction or rely on interleaved modeling, OmniDRCA aims to enhance mutual modality awareness during generation.

Method: OmniDRCA employs joint autoregressive modeling with dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment to process speech and text in parallel.

Result: OmniDRCA achieves SOTA performance in parallel joint speech-text modeling and competitive results compared to interleaved models, as demonstrated on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks.

Conclusion: OmniDRCA presents a promising framework for parallel speech-text modeling, with potential for extension to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies on end-to-end speech generation with large language models
(LLMs) have attracted significant community attention, with multiple works
extending text-based LLMs to generate discrete speech tokens. Existing
approaches primarily fall into two categories: (1) Methods that generate
discrete speech tokens independently without incorporating them into the LLM's
autoregressive process, resulting in text generation being unaware of
concurrent speech synthesis. (2) Models that generate interleaved or parallel
speech-text tokens through joint autoregressive modeling, enabling mutual
modality awareness during generation. This paper presents OmniDRCA, a parallel
speech-text foundation model based on joint autoregressive modeling, featuring
dual-resolution speech representations and contrastive cross-modal alignment.
Our approach processes speech and text representations in parallel while
enhancing audio comprehension through contrastive alignment. Experimental
results on Spoken Question Answering benchmarks demonstrate that OmniDRCA
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among parallel joint
speech-text modeling based foundation models, and achieves competitive
performance compared to interleaved models. Additionally, we explore the
potential of extending the framework to full-duplex conversational scenarios.

TL;DR: RuleReasoner, a reinforced rule-based reasoning method, outperforms large reasoning models (LRMs) by leveraging domain-aware dynamic sampling and achieves robust generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can effectively learn rule-based reasoning with strong generalization, given the challenges posed by diverse rule formats and complexities.

Method: Introduces RuleReasoner, which uses domain-aware dynamic sampling to resample training batches based on historical rewards, enabling flexible learning without pre-engineered mix-training.

Result: RuleReasoner surpasses LRMs by 4.1% on in-distribution tasks and 10.4% on out-of-distribution tasks, while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: RuleReasoner demonstrates that SRMs can achieve robust and efficient rule-based reasoning, outperforming larger models.

Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems
in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in
real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that
large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their
performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However,
it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn
rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse
tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based
Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct
rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel
domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples
each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based
on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online
learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered
mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on
in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that
RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1%
average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD
tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational
efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVE is a Diversity-Enhanced method for reconstructing dense LLMs into MoE LLMs, improving training efficiency while maintaining accuracy by leveraging expert diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE reconstruction methods often ignore expert diversity, leading to redundancy. DIVE addresses this by utilizing diversity observed in pruned LLMs.

Method: DIVE involves domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction (focusing on FFN modules), and efficient retraining of routers, experts, and normalization modules.

Result: DIVE achieves higher training efficiency with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming other pruning and MoE reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: DIVE effectively balances training efficiency and model performance by enhancing expert diversity in MoE LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the
parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of
extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas
reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training
budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity
among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with
the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being
pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a
Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE
includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and
efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and
reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we
efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We
implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora.
Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy
trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with
the same number of activated parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COGENT is a curriculum-oriented framework for generating grade-appropriate educational content, addressing challenges in Generative AI for education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI struggles with aligning to curriculum standards and maintaining grade-appropriate readability, especially in STEM education.

Method: COGENT integrates science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives, controls readability, and uses a "wonder-based" approach for engagement.

Result: COGENT produces grade-appropriate content comparable or superior to human references, validated by LLM and human evaluation.

Conclusion: COGENT offers a scalable solution for adaptive, high-quality educational content generation.

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in
content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several
challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain
grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education
poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday
language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger
students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for
generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three
curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives),
control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and
adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest.
We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human
expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces
grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references.
Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality
learning resources.

TL;DR: CoLMbo is a Speaker Language Model (SLM) that generates detailed speaker descriptions, overcoming limitations of traditional speaker recognition systems by using prompt-based conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional speaker recognition systems lack the ability to provide detailed speaker characteristics or context-rich descriptions, focusing only on classification tasks.

Method: CoLMbo integrates a speaker encoder with prompt-based conditioning, enabling dynamic adaptation to new speaker traits and generating customized descriptions.

Result: The model excels in zero-shot scenarios and provides detailed captions, including demographic attributes like dialect, gender, and age.

Conclusion: CoLMbo represents a significant advancement in speaker recognition by enhancing profiling capabilities and adaptability.

Abstract: Speaker recognition systems are often limited to classification tasks and
struggle to generate detailed speaker characteristics or provide context-rich
descriptions. These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker
identification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,
gender, and age in a structured manner. This paper introduces CoLMbo, a Speaker
Language Model (SLM) that addresses these limitations by integrating a speaker
encoder with prompt-based conditioning. This allows for the creation of
detailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined
prompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides
customized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates automatic differentiation of perceived low-quality vs. high-quality news headlines/links using 12 ML models on a large dataset, finding traditional ensembles and fine-tuned DistilBERT effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of widespread low-quality news by automating quality differentiation.

Method: Evaluated 12 ML models on a balanced dataset of 57.5M news links/headlines with 115 linguistic features, using expert-derived binary labels.

Result: Bagging classifier (88.1% accuracy) and fine-tuned DistilBERT (90.3% accuracy) performed best, with trade-offs in training time.

Conclusion: Both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can effectively distinguish news quality, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The proliferation of online news enables potential widespread publication of
perceived low-quality news headlines/links. As a result, we investigated
whether it was possible to automatically distinguish perceived lower-quality
news headlines/links from perceived higher-quality headlines/links. We
evaluated twelve machine learning models on a binary, balanced dataset of
57,544,214 worldwide news website links/headings from 2018-2024 (28,772,107 per
class) with 115 extracted linguistic features. Binary labels for each text were
derived from scores based on expert consensus regarding the respective news
domain quality. Traditional ensemble methods, particularly the bagging
classifier, had strong performance (88.1% accuracy, 88.3% F1, 80/20 train/test
split). Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved the highest accuracy (90.3%, 80/20
train/test split) but required more training time. The results suggest that
both NLP features with traditional classifiers and deep learning models can
effectively differentiate perceived news headline/link quality, with some
trade-off between predictive performance and train time.

*Haoran Zhao,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Large language models (LLMs) show context-sensitive politeness strategies but overuse negative politeness, raising concerns about pragmatic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether LLMs align with human politeness strategies, balancing informational and social goals.

Method: Compare human and LLM responses in constrained and open-ended tasks, analyzing politeness strategies.

Result: Larger LLMs replicate human politeness preferences but overuse negative strategies, even in positive contexts.

Conclusion: LLMs handle politeness well but exhibit subtle misalignments, highlighting challenges for AI pragmatic alignment.

Abstract: Polite speech poses a fundamental alignment challenge for large language
models (LLMs). Humans deploy a rich repertoire of linguistic strategies to
balance informational and social goals -- from positive approaches that build
rapport (compliments, expressions of interest) to negative strategies that
minimize imposition (hedging, indirectness). We investigate whether LLMs employ
a similarly context-sensitive repertoire by comparing human and LLM responses
in both constrained and open-ended production tasks. We find that larger models
($\ge$70B parameters) successfully replicate key preferences from the
computational pragmatics literature, and human evaluators surprisingly prefer
LLM-generated responses in open-ended contexts. However, further linguistic
analyses reveal that models disproportionately rely on negative politeness
strategies even in positive contexts, potentially leading to
misinterpretations. While modern LLMs demonstrate an impressive handle on
politeness strategies, these subtle differences raise important questions about
pragmatic alignment in AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KT$^2$ is a probabilistic framework for knowledge tracing that uses hierarchical knowledge concepts to improve performance in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KT methods struggle in low-resource, online classroom settings where data is sparse and updates are frequent.

Method: KT$^2$ employs a Hidden Markov Tree Model to track student mastery over a tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts, using an EM algorithm and incremental updates.

Result: KT$^2$ outperforms baselines in online, low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: KT$^2$ effectively leverages hierarchical knowledge structures to enhance knowledge tracing in sparse data environments.

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to estimate a student's evolving knowledge state
and predict their performance on new exercises based on performance history.
Many realistic classroom settings for KT are typically low-resource in data and
require online updates as students' exercise history grows, which creates
significant challenges for existing KT approaches. To restore strong
performance under low-resource conditions, we revisit the hierarchical
knowledge concept (KC) information, which is typically available in many
classroom settings and can provide strong prior when data are sparse. We
therefore propose Knowledge-Tree-based Knowledge Tracing (KT$^2$), a
probabilistic KT framework that models student understanding over a
tree-structured hierarchy of knowledge concepts using a Hidden Markov Tree
Model. KT$^2$ estimates student mastery via an EM algorithm and supports
personalized prediction through an incremental update mechanism as new
responses arrive. Our experiments show that KT$^2$ consistently outperforms
strong baselines in realistic online, low-resource settings.

TL;DR: Token Constraint Decoding (TCD) improves LLM robustness to input noise, restoring performance by up to 39% for weaker models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform well on MCQA but are vulnerable to minor input perturbations, limiting real-world reliability.

Method: TCD enforces token-level prediction alignment during inference, paired with prompt engineering for enhanced robustness.

Result: TCD significantly restores performance under noise, with up to +39% gains for weaker models, and regularizes overconfident outputs.

Conclusion: TCD is a practical, model-agnostic method to enhance LLM reasoning stability, aiding safer deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly
vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and
evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective
inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to
enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on
CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired
with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded
by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like
Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly
regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct
penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a
practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under
real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs
in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

*Xiujun Zhou,Pingjian Zhang,Deyou Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PGDA-KGQA is a prompt-guided generative framework for KGQA that enhances training data diversity and multi-hop reasoning through three augmentation strategies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of current KGQA methods, such as scarce annotated data, lack of multi-hop reasoning samples, and semantic distortion in data augmentation.

Method: PGDA-KGQA uses a unified prompt-design paradigm with three strategies: single-hop pseudo question generation, semantic-preserving question rewriting, and answer-guided reverse path exploration for multi-hop questions.

Result: Achieves improvements on WebQSP (2.8% F1, 1.2% Hits@1, 3.1% Accuracy) and ComplexWebQuestions (1.8% F1, 1.1% Hits@1, 2.4% Accuracy).

Conclusion: PGDA-KGQA effectively addresses data scarcity and multi-hop reasoning challenges, enhancing KGQA performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a crucial task in natural
language processing that requires reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) to
answer natural language questions. Recent methods utilizing large language
models (LLMs) have shown remarkable semantic parsing capabilities but are
limited by the scarcity of diverse annotated data and multi-hop reasoning
samples. Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on
single-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods
primarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,
thus limiting data diversity. The scarcity of multi-hop samples further weakens
models' generalization. To address these issues, we propose PGDA-KGQA, a
prompt-guided generative framework with multiple data augmentation strategies
for KGQA. At its core, PGDA-KGQA employs a unified prompt-design paradigm: by
crafting meticulously engineered prompts that integrate the provided textual
content, it leverages LLMs to generate large-scale (question, logical form)
pairs for model training. Specifically, PGDA-KGQA enriches its training set by:
(1) generating single-hop pseudo questions to improve the alignment of question
semantics with KG relations; (2) applying semantic-preserving question
rewriting to improve robustness against linguistic variations; (3) employing
answer-guided reverse path exploration to create realistic multi-hop questions.
By adopting an augment-generate-retrieve semantic parsing pipeline, PGDA-KGQA
utilizes the augmented data to enhance the accuracy of logical form generation
and thus improve answer retrieval performance. Experiments demonstrate that
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard KGQA datasets, achieving
improvements on WebQSP by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 3.1% and on ComplexWebQuestions by
1.8%, 1.1%, and 2.4% in F1, Hits@1, and Accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs and LMMs for automated deception detection across diverse datasets, finding fine-tuned LLMs excel in textual tasks while LMMs struggle with cross-modal cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting deception digitally is critical but challenging, prompting the need to assess LLMs and LMMs for this task.

Method: Evaluated open-source and commercial LLMs on RLTD, MU3D, and OpSpam datasets, testing zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned setups, and analyzed auxiliary features and prompting strategies.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieved state-of-the-art performance in textual deception detection; LMMs underperformed in leveraging cross-modal cues.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for real-world deception detection but have limitations, especially in multimodal contexts.

Abstract: Detecting deception in an increasingly digital world is both a critical and
challenging task. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the
automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains. We assess the
performance of both open-source and commercial LLMs on three distinct datasets:
real life trial interviews (RLTD), instructed deception in interpersonal
scenarios (MU3D), and deceptive reviews (OpSpam). We systematically analyze the
effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection,
including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based
in-context example selection. Our results show that fine-tuned LLMs achieve
state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection tasks, while LMMs
struggle to fully leverage cross-modal cues. Additionally, we analyze the
impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures and video summaries,
and examine the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including
direct label generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Our findings provide
key insights into how LLMs process and interpret deceptive cues across
modalities, highlighting their potential and limitations in real-world
deception detection applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel SFT method reduces catastrophic forgetting in LLMs without needing original pre-training data, preserving general capabilities while improving task-specific performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often diminishes LLMs' general capabilities and exacerbates catastrophic forgetting, especially when original pre-training data is inaccessible.

Method: Reconstructs the base model's likely SFT instruction distribution, uses multi-model screening to select optimal data, and mixes it with new data for SFT.

Result: Preserves generalization in general domains while enhancing task-specific performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a cost-effective solution to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in SFT without original data access.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)'
instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often
diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of
original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated
when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could
effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to
original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT
instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening
process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization
capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ToM is challenging for LLMs, and existing benchmarks lack integration. UniToMBench aims to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities.

Method: UniToMBench integrates multi-interaction tasks, evolving scenarios, and perspective-taking techniques, supported by a custom dataset of 1,000+ hand-written scenarios.

Result: GPT-4o models achieve >80% accuracy in emotional/belief tasks but show variability in knowledge-based tasks.

Conclusion: UniToMBench is a valuable tool for assessing and improving ToM in LLMs, revealing current strengths and limitations.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself
and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which
often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we
introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of
SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in
LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story
scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios,
UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation
metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we
observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high
accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with
results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their
performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the
strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring
the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our

*Zeguan Xiao,Yun Chen,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: POET, a method to address the reward-generation gap in Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), improves performance by equal-length truncation of responses, enhancing focus on prefix tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAAs like DPO and SimPO face a reward-generation gap due to misaligned optimization objectives and generation performance, particularly regarding prefix tokens.

Method: POET truncates preferred and dispreferred responses to equal length, ensuring diverse truncated lengths across samples to better align optimization with generation.

Result: POET improves DPO and SimPO, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and better downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Addressing the reward-generation gap in DAAs via POET highlights the need for alignment between reward optimization and generation performance.

Abstract: Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO), have emerged as efficient
alternatives to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms
for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, DAAs
suffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the "reward-generation gap"
-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual
generation performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor
to the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of
prefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is
reflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we
introduce a simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length
Training (POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to
match the shorter one's length. Training with POET, where both responses in
each sample are truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated
lengths across samples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly
constrained to converge across all positions, thus paying more attention to
prefix tokens than the standard DAAs. We conduct experiments with DPO and
SimPO, two representative DAAs, demonstrating that POET improves over their
standard implementations, achieving up to 15.6 points in AlpacaEval 2 and
overall improvements across downstream tasks. Our results highlight the
importance of addressing the misalignment between reward optimization and
generation performance in DAAs.

TL;DR: The study explores suicidal behaviors on YouTube using computational and expert-driven methods, identifying unique digital indicators like YouTube Engagement and differing motivations between pre-attempt and post-attempt content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a major cause of death, and social media data provides new insights into suicidal behavior. The study aims to bridge digital behavior and clinical knowledge.

Method: Combined computational (LLM-based topic modeling), hybrid (expert review), and top-down (psychological assessment) approaches on 181 suicide-attempt YouTube channels and 134 controls.

Result: Identified five suicide-attempt-related topics, with two showing temporal changes. YouTube Engagement was a unique digital indicator missed by experts. Motivations differed between pre-attempt (Help Others) and post-attempt (Personal Recovery) content.

Conclusion: Integrating digital and clinical approaches offers nuanced insights into suicidality, highlighting the value of bottom-up discovery in understanding suicidal behaviors on social media.

Abstract: Suicide remains a leading cause of death in Western countries, underscoring
the need for new research approaches. As social media becomes central to daily
life, digital footprints offer valuable insight into suicidal behavior.
Focusing on individuals who attempted suicide while uploading videos to their
channels, we investigate: How do suicidal behaviors manifest on YouTube, and
how do they differ from expert knowledge? We applied complementary approaches:
computational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel
longitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with
life-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up
approach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral
indicators. Of 166 topics, five were associated with suicide-attempt, with two
also showing temporal attempt-related changes ($p<.01$) - Mental Health
Struggles ($+0.08$)* and YouTube Engagement ($+0.1$)*. In the hybrid approach,
a clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as
suicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal
effects beyond those identified bottom-up. Notably, YouTube Engagement, a
platform-specific indicator, was not flagged by the expert, underscoring the
value of bottom-up discovery. In the top-down approach, psychological
assessment of suicide attempt narratives revealed that the only significant
difference between individuals who attempted before and those attempted during
their upload period was the motivation to share this experience: the former
aimed to Help Others ($\beta=-1.69$, $p<.01$), while the latter framed it as
part of their Personal Recovery ($\beta=1.08$, $p<.01$). By integrating these
approaches, we offer a nuanced understanding of suicidality, bridging digital
behavior and clinical insights.

TL;DR: LLM performance reproducibility is fragile due to system configuration changes, especially in reasoning models, caused by floating-point arithmetic non-associativity. LayerCast, a lightweight pipeline, addresses this by balancing precision and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and address the reproducibility issues in LLM performance caused by varying system configurations and numerical precision.

Method: Conduct controlled experiments across hardware, software, and precision settings to quantify output divergence. Develop LayerCast, a pipeline using 16-bit weight storage and FP32 computation.

Result: System configuration changes (e.g., GPU count, batch size) cause up to 9% accuracy variation and 9,000 token length differences. Floating-point precision is critical but often overlooked.

Conclusion: Reproducibility in LLMs is highly sensitive to numerical precision. LayerCast offers a practical solution by balancing efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have
demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise
that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that
the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system
configuration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can
introduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is
especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in
early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting
accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a
reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation
in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences
in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this
variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under
limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic
investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM
inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,
software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs
diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical
for reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by
this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that
stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,
balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified rotary position embedding (RoPE) method to integrate Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs), addressing positional encoding incompatibility. The resulting hybrid model, \model, achieves faster training/inference and higher accuracy than standard Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of integrating Transformers (reliant on explicit positional embeddings) and SSMs (using implicit convolutions) due to positional encoding incompatibility, leading to performance issues.

Method: Proposes a unified rotary position embedding (\ourRoPE) to align positional encoding for both self-attention and state-space components, enabling seamless integration in the hybrid \model architecture.

Result: \model is 42.3% faster in training and 29.5% faster in inference at 4K sequence length, with over 4% higher accuracy on language modeling benchmarks. Scaling also improves, with a 7.22% accuracy gain for \model-1.3B over its 320M version.

Conclusion: Unified positional encoding resolves incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient and high-performance long-context modeling.

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies,
whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling.
Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these
architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a
fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms:
Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs
leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence
often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this
impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE})
methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework
for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we
introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the
Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a
4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are
\textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard
Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable
settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling
benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains
\textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\%
gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified
positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models,
enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

Conclusion: The approach significantly advances medical reasoning in LLMs, setting new benchmarks for smaller models.

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in
mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical
question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce
ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality
examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by
various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent
verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner}
to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps
flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best
practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining
detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields
the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train
ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the
prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

TL;DR: KG-Infused RAG enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation by integrating knowledge graphs and cognitive mechanisms, outperforming vanilla RAG by 3.8% to 13.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods rely on single knowledge sources and lack cognitive mechanisms for knowledge activation.

Method: Proposes KG-Infused RAG, integrating knowledge graphs for spreading activation, query expansion, and multi-source retrieval.

Result: Outperforms vanilla RAG by 3.8% to 13.8% on QA benchmarks and enhances Self-RAG.

Conclusion: KG-Infused RAG is an effective, versatile plug-and-play enhancement for corpus-based RAG methods.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves factual accuracy by grounding
responses in external knowledge. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single source, either unstructured text or structured knowledge. Moreover, they
lack cognitively inspired mechanisms for activating relevant knowledge. To
address these issues, we propose KG-Infused RAG, a framework that integrates
KGs into RAG systems to implement spreading activation, a cognitive process
that enables concept association and inference. KG-Infused RAG retrieves KG
facts, expands the query accordingly, and enhances generation by combining
corpus passages with structured facts, enabling interpretable, multi-source
retrieval grounded in semantic structure. We further improve KG-Infused RAG via
preference learning on sampled key stages in the pipeline. Experiments on five
QA benchmarks show that KG-Infused RAG consistently outperforms vanilla RAG (by
3.8% to 13.8%). Additionally, when integrated into Self-RAG, KG-Infused RAG
brings further performance gains, demonstrating its effectiveness and
versatility as a plug-and-play enhancement module for corpus-based RAG methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDUSA is a multimodal framework for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) that addresses class imbalance and emotion ambiguity through a four-stage training pipeline, achieving top performance in a 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The subjective nature of human emotions and uneven representation in naturalistic conditions make SER challenging. MEDUSA aims to tackle these issues.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: ensemble training with DeepSER (cross-modal transformer fusion), Manifold MixUp regularization, and meta-classifier optimization using soft targets, balanced sampling, and multitask learning.

Result: Ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion Recognition at Interspeech 2025.

Conclusion: MEDUSA effectively handles SER challenges, demonstrating superior performance in naturalistic conditions.

Abstract: SER is a challenging task due to the subjective nature of human emotions and
their uneven representation under naturalistic conditions. We propose MEDUSA, a
multimodal framework with a four-stage training pipeline, which effectively
handles class imbalance and emotion ambiguity. The first two stages train an
ensemble of classifiers that utilize DeepSER, a novel extension of a deep
cross-modal transformer fusion mechanism from pretrained self-supervised
acoustic and linguistic representations. Manifold MixUp is employed for further
regularization. The last two stages optimize a trainable meta-classifier that
combines the ensemble predictions. Our training approach incorporates human
annotation scores as soft targets, coupled with balanced data sampling and
multitask learning. MEDUSA ranked 1st in Task 1: Categorical Emotion
Recognition in the Interspeech 2025: Speech Emotion Recognition in Naturalistic
Conditions Challenge.

### [150] [Gender Bias in English-to-Greek Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09558)
*Eleni Gkovedarou,Joke Daems,Luna De Bruyne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines gender bias in Google Translate and DeepL for English-to-Greek translations, introducing GendEL, a dataset to evaluate bias. GPT-4o is explored as a mitigation tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about machine translation systems reinforcing gender stereotypes, particularly in understudied language pairs like English-to-Greek.

Method: Analyzed gender bias in Google Translate and DeepL using GendEL, a dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences. GPT-4o was tested for bias mitigation.

Result: Both MT systems showed persistent gender bias, performing well in gender-explicit cases but poorly in gender-inclusive or neutral translations. GPT-4o showed promise but had residual biases.

Conclusion: GPT-4o has potential for mitigating gender bias in translations, but further refinement is needed to address residual biases and improve inclusivity.

Abstract: As the demand for inclusive language increases, concern has grown over the
susceptibility of machine translation (MT) systems to reinforce gender
stereotypes. This study investigates gender bias in two commercial MT systems,
Google Translate and DeepL, focusing on the understudied English-to-Greek
language pair. We address three aspects of gender bias: i) male bias, ii)
occupational stereotyping, and iii) errors in anti-stereotypical translations.
Additionally, we explore the potential of prompted GPT-4o as a bias mitigation
tool that provides both gender-explicit and gender-neutral alternatives when
necessary. To achieve this, we introduce GendEL, a manually crafted bilingual
dataset of 240 gender-ambiguous and unambiguous sentences that feature
stereotypical occupational nouns and adjectives. We find persistent gender bias
in translations by both MT systems; while they perform well in cases where
gender is explicitly defined, with DeepL outperforming both Google Translate
and GPT-4o in feminine gender-unambiguous sentences, they are far from
producing gender-inclusive or neutral translations when the gender is
unspecified. GPT-4o shows promise, generating appropriate gendered and neutral
alternatives for most ambiguous cases, though residual biases remain evident.

### [151] [Towards Open Foundation Language Model and Corpus for Macedonian: A Low-Resource Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09560)
*Stefan Krsteski,Matea Tashkovska,Borjan Sazdov,Hristijan Gjoreski,Branislav Gerazov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces resources for advancing LLMs in Macedonian, including a large corpus, an instruction dataset, and an evaluation suite. It also presents 'domestic-yak,' an 8B-parameter model outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited capabilities of LLMs for low-resource languages like Macedonian by creating datasets and models tailored for such contexts.

Method: Collecting a 40GB Macedonian corpus, a 106k-instruction dataset, and constructing an evaluation suite. Training the 'domestic-yak' model on curated data.

Result: The 'domestic-yak' model outperforms all 8B-parameter models and matches larger models (up to 10x size) in benchmarks. Native speakers prefer it for grammatical and cultural accuracy.

Conclusion: The resources and model advance LLM adoption for underrepresented languages, with all materials openly released for further research.

Abstract: The increase in technological adoption worldwide comes with demands for novel
tools to be used by the general population. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a great opportunity in this respect, but their capabilities remain
limited for low-resource languages, restricting applications in countries where
such languages are spoken. We create several resources to facilitate the
adoption of LLMs and to support research advancements for Macedonian. We
collect the largest Macedonian corpus to date, consisting of 40GB of textual
data and totaling 3.5B words. To support conversational applications, we
collect a 106k-instance instruction dataset, carefully built to be culturally
grounded. For evaluation, we construct a Macedonian evaluation suite covering
seven benchmarks. Finally, we train domestic-yak, a state-of-the-art
8B-parameter model, on our curated datasets and evaluate it against eight
baseline models using the newly constructed benchmark suite. Our model
outperforms all existing models in the 8B parameter range across all
benchmarks, and achieves performance comparable to models up to 10x larger.
Furthermore, a qualitative analysis with native speakers reveals that our model
is preferred over larger counterparts, receiving higher ratings for grammatical
correctness and cultural appropriateness. All datasets, code, and model weights
are openly released, setting a foundation for advancing LLMs in similarly
underrepresented languages. These resources are publicly available at
github.com/LVSTCK for source code, and at huggingface.co/LVSTCK for pretrained
model weights and data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance factual grounding and reasoning in LLMs by leveraging structured knowledge from KGs, addressing gaps like scalability and data quality.

Method: Systematic categorization of existing approaches into KG-enhanced LLMs (improving reasoning) and LLM-augmented KGs (facilitating KG tasks).

Result: Identifies mutual benefits, gaps in scalability and efficiency, and emphasizes the need for neuro-symbolic integration and dynamic KG updating.

Conclusion: Proposes future directions like neuro-symbolic methods and ethical considerations for advancing intelligent systems in complex knowledge tasks.

Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large
Language Models (LLMs) enhances factual grounding and reasoning capabilities.
This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs,
categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which
improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question
answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion,
and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and
highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to
existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational
efficiency, and data quality. Finally, we propose future research directions,
including neuro-symbolic integration, dynamic KG updating, data reliability,
and ethical considerations, paving the way for intelligent systems capable of
managing more complex real-world knowledge tasks.

### [153] [Memorization in Language Models through the Lens of Intrinsic Dimension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09591)
*Stefan Arnold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how Intrinsic Dimension (ID) affects memorization in language models, finding that high-ID sequences are less likely to be memorized, especially in overparameterized models and sparse exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how latent structure (measured by ID) influences memorization in LMs, addressing privacy and intellectual property concerns.

Method: Investigates the role of ID as a geometric proxy for sequence complexity in latent space and its impact on memorization.

Result: High-ID sequences suppress memorization, particularly in overparameterized models and sparse exposure scenarios.

Conclusion: Memorization in LMs is shaped by the interplay of scale, exposure, and sequence complexity (ID).

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to memorizing parts of their data during
training and unintentionally emitting them at generation time, raising concerns
about privacy leakage and disclosure of intellectual property. While previous
research has identified properties such as context length, parameter size, and
duplication frequency, as key drivers of unintended memorization, little is
known about how the latent structure modulates this rate of memorization. We
investigate the role of Intrinsic Dimension (ID), a geometric proxy for the
structural complexity of a sequence in latent space, in modulating
memorization. Our findings suggest that ID acts as a suppressive signal for
memorization: compared to low-ID sequences, high-ID sequences are less likely
to be memorized, particularly in overparameterized models and under sparse
exposure. These findings highlight the interaction between scale, exposure, and
complexity in shaping memorization.

### [154] [Benchmarking Debiasing Methods for LLM-based Parameter Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09627)
*Nicolas Audinet de Pieuchon,Adel Daoud,Connor T. Jerzak,Moa Johansson,Richard Johansson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares debiasing methods (DSL and PPI) for LLM annotations, analyzing their performance with varying expert annotations and highlighting a bias-variance tradeoff.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are inconsistent compared to experts, biasing downstream tasks. Debiasing methods like DSL and PPI aim to mitigate this but lack empirical comparison in finite samples.

Method: Study performance scaling with expert annotations and compare DSL and PPI across tasks.

Result: DSL often outperforms PPI in bias reduction and efficiency but is less consistent. Both methods work well with large datasets.

Conclusion: A bias-variance tradeoff exists in debiasing methods, necessitating further research on efficiency metrics for finite samples.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer an inexpensive yet powerful way to
annotate text, but are often inconsistent when compared with experts. These
errors can bias downstream estimates of population parameters such as
regression coefficients and causal effects. To mitigate this bias, researchers
have developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)
and Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by
combining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert
annotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under
theoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of
sizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we
study how each method's performance scales with the number of expert
annotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels
significantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of
tasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL
often outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its
performance is less consistent across datasets. Our findings indicate that
there is a bias-variance tradeoff at the level of debiasing methods, calling
for more research on developing metrics for quantifying their efficiency in
finite samples.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares probabilistic and NDL predictors for modeling acoustic word duration, finding N-gram models outperform NDL, though information-theoretic enhancements improve NDL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of probabilistic and NDL predictors in modeling acoustic word duration, challenging assumptions about NDL's cognitive advantages.

Method: Three models were tested: NDL with information-theoretic formulas, traditional NDL, and N-gram probabilistic predictors, using the Buckeye corpus.

Result: The N-gram model outperformed both NDL models, but information-theoretic enhancements improved NDL's performance.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes incorporating frequency, contextual predictability, and information-theoretic metrics for better modeling of acoustic reduction.

Abstract: This study compares probabilistic predictors based on information theory with
Naive Discriminative Learning (NDL) predictors in modeling acoustic word
duration, focusing on probabilistic reduction. We examine three models using
the Buckeye corpus: one with NDL-derived predictors using information-theoretic
formulas, one with traditional NDL predictors, and one with N-gram
probabilistic predictors. Results show that the N-gram model outperforms both
NDL models, challenging the assumption that NDL is more effective due to its
cognitive motivation. However, incorporating information-theoretic formulas
into NDL improves model performance over the traditional model. This research
highlights a) the need to incorporate not only frequency and contextual
predictability but also average contextual predictability, and b) the
importance of combining information-theoretic metrics of predictability and
information derived from discriminative learning in modeling acoustic
reduction.

*Harry Walsh,Maksym Ivashechkin,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Sign Language Production techniques to augment small sign language datasets, improving Sign Language Translation model performance by up to 19%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign languages are low-resource, making dataset collection challenging. The paper aims to enhance Sign Language Translation by leveraging production methods.

Method: Uses skeleton-based production, sign stitching, and generative models (SignGAN, SignSplat) to create dataset variations.

Result: Performance of Sign Language Translation models improved by up to 19%.

Conclusion: The methods effectively augment datasets, enabling better translation models in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Machine learning models fundamentally rely on large quantities of
high-quality data. Collecting the necessary data for these models can be
challenging due to cost, scarcity, and privacy restrictions. Signed languages
are visual languages used by the deaf community and are considered low-resource
languages. Sign language datasets are often orders of magnitude smaller than
their spoken language counterparts. Sign Language Production is the task of
generating sign language videos from spoken language sentences, while Sign
Language Translation is the reverse translation task. Here, we propose
leveraging recent advancements in Sign Language Production to augment existing
sign language datasets and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation
models. For this, we utilize three techniques: a skeleton-based approach to
production, sign stitching, and two photo-realistic generative models, SignGAN
and SignSplat. We evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing
the performance of Sign Language Translation models by generating variation in
the signer's appearance and the motion of the skeletal data. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed methods can effectively augment existing datasets
and enhance the performance of Sign Language Translation models by up to 19%,
paving the way for more robust and accurate Sign Language Translation systems,
even in resource-constrained environments.

*Tianjun Yao,Haoxuan Li,Zhiqiang Shen,Pan Li,Tongliang Liu,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAPL is a novel framework for graph retrieval in KGQA, addressing limitations of existing methods through a two-stage labeling strategy, model-agnostic graph transformation, and path-based reasoning. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG pipelines for LLMs rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured reasoning. Knowledge graphs offer a structured alternative, but current graph-based retrievers struggle with generalization.

Method: RAPL introduces a two-stage labeling strategy, model-agnostic graph transformation, and path-based reasoning to enhance retrieval and reasoning in KGQA.

Result: RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.66%-20.34%, reduces performance gaps between LLMs, and improves cross-dataset generalizability.

Conclusion: RAPL provides an efficient and effective solution for graph retrieval in KGQA, demonstrating superior performance and generalizability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong inductive reasoning ability
across various domains, but their reliability is hindered by the outdated
knowledge and hallucinations. Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these
issues by grounding LLMs with external knowledge; however, most existing RAG
pipelines rely on unstructured text, limiting interpretability and structured
reasoning. Knowledge graphs, which represent facts as relational triples, offer
a more structured and compact alternative. Recent studies have explored
integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for knowledge graph question answering
(KGQA), with a significant proportion adopting the retrieve-then-reasoning
paradigm. In this framework, graph-based retrievers have demonstrated strong
empirical performance, yet they still face challenges in generalization
ability. In this work, we propose RAPL, a novel framework for efficient and
effective graph retrieval in KGQA. RAPL addresses these limitations through
three aspects: (1) a two-stage labeling strategy that combines heuristic
signals with parametric models to provide causally grounded supervision; (2) a
model-agnostic graph transformation approach to capture both intra- and
inter-triple interactions, thereby enhancing representational capacity; and (3)
a path-based reasoning strategy that facilitates learning from the injected
rational knowledge, and supports downstream reasoner through structured inputs.
Empirically, RAPL outperforms state-of-the-art methods by $2.66\%-20.34\%$, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between smaller and more powerful
LLM-based reasoners, as well as the gap under cross-dataset settings,
highlighting its superior retrieval capability and generalizability. Codes are

*Lihu Chen,Gaël Varoquaux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free method, Internal Confidence, to detect knowledge boundaries in LLMs via query-level uncertainty, improving adaptive inference and reducing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing LLMs' awareness of their knowledge boundaries to enable adaptive inference (e.g., RAG, abstention) for efficient and trustworthy AI.

Method: Introduces Internal Confidence, a self-evaluation technique across layers and tokens to detect query-level uncertainty without generating tokens.

Result: Outperforms baselines on factual QA and math reasoning tasks; enables efficient RAG and model cascading, reducing inference costs.

Conclusion: Internal Confidence effectively identifies knowledge boundaries, aiding adaptive inference and cost-efficient AI deployment.

Abstract: It is important for Large Language Models to be aware of the boundary of
their knowledge, the mechanism of identifying known and unknown queries. This
type of awareness can help models perform adaptive inference, such as invoking
RAG, engaging in slow and deep thinking, or adopting the abstention mechanism,
which is beneficial to the development of efficient and trustworthy AI. In this
work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level
Uncertainty, which aims to determine if the model is able to address a given
query without generating any tokens. To this end, we introduce a novel and
training-free method called \emph{Internal Confidence}, which leverages
self-evaluations across layers and tokens. Empirical results on both factual QA
and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our internal confidence can
outperform several baselines. Furthermore, we showcase that our proposed method
can be used for efficient RAG and model cascading, which is able to reduce
inference costs while maintaining performance.

*Hao Xiong,Chuanyuan Tan,Wenliang Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses issues in Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) for LLMs by introducing locality evaluation datasets and optimizing fine-tuning methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve UKE by addressing the lack of locality evaluation and the failure of fine-tuning methods, ensuring better knowledge updates in LLMs.

Method: Constructs datasets (UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc) for locality evaluation and identifies factors affecting fine-tuning, proposing an optimized method (FT-UKE).

Result: FT-UKE outperforms existing methods, with performance improving as batch size increases (average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%).

Conclusion: The study provides a robust training recipe for UKE, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning with optimal settings.

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant
knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs,
such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world
knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested
them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2)
Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these
issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by
extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the
unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the
Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may
affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct
experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be
trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our
experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting
(FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well,
with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows,
expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

*Haoyi Song,Ruihan Ji,Naichen Shi,Fan Lai,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) in large language models (LLMs), proposing a new measure called Inv-Entropy and a perturbation algorithm (GAAP). It outperforms existing methods and includes a novel evaluation metric (TSU).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UQ methods for LLMs lack a probabilistic foundation and are often heuristic. The paper aims to provide a theoretical and flexible framework for reliable UQ.

Method: The framework models input-output pairs as Markov chains, uses an inverse model to quantify uncertainty, and introduces Inv-Entropy. GAAP, a genetic algorithm-based perturbation method, enhances input diversity.

Result: Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods, and the proposed framework supports various uncertainty measures and metrics.

Conclusion: The paper presents a robust, flexible, and theoretically grounded framework for UQ in LLMs, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing,
but their reliable deployment requires effective uncertainty quantification
(UQ). Existing UQ methods are often heuristic and lack a probabilistic
foundation. This paper begins by providing a theoretical justification for the
role of perturbations in UQ for LLMs. We then introduce a dual random walk
perspective, modeling input-output pairs as two Markov chains with transition
probabilities defined by semantic similarity. Building on this, we propose a
fully probabilistic framework based on an inverse model, which quantifies
uncertainty by evaluating the diversity of the input space conditioned on a
given output through systematic perturbations. Within this framework, we define
a new uncertainty measure, Inv-Entropy. A key strength of our framework is its
flexibility: it supports various definitions of uncertainty measures,
embeddings, perturbation strategies, and similarity metrics. We also propose
GAAP, a perturbation algorithm based on genetic algorithms, which enhances the
diversity of sampled inputs. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric,
Temperature Sensitivity of Uncertainty (TSU), which directly assesses
uncertainty without relying on correctness as a proxy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Inv-Entropy outperforms existing semantic UQ methods. The code

TL;DR: ComfyUI-R1 is a large reasoning model for automated workflow generation, trained with a two-stage framework, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in AI-generated content workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of crafting effective AI-generated content workflows requires expertise, presenting a steep learning curve for users.

Method: ComfyUI-R1 uses a two-stage training framework: CoT fine-tuning for domain adaptation and reinforcement learning for reasoning capability, guided by a hybrid reward system.

Result: The 7B-parameter model achieves 97% format validity, high pass rates, and superior F1 scores, outperforming GPT-4o and Claude series.

Conclusion: ComfyUI-R1 demonstrates the potential of long chain-of-thought reasoning in AI art creation, excelling in synthesizing complex workflows.

Abstract: AI-generated content has evolved from monolithic models to modular workflows,
particularly on platforms like ComfyUI, enabling customization in creative
pipelines. However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to
orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve
for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large
reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated
dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow
representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT
fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2)
reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a
fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural
integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter
model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate,
node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior
state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as
GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the
reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code.
Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows
with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art
creation.

*Andreas Säuberli,Diego Frassinelli,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates if LLMs can mimic human responses in educational tests, finding limited human-likeness, especially in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate test development by using LLMs as pilot participants if they exhibit human-like response behavior.

Method: Evaluated 18 instruction-tuned LLMs using psychometric frameworks (classical test theory and item response theory) on multiple-choice test items in reading, U.S. history, and economics.

Result: Larger models are overly confident but can be calibrated for more human-like responses. LLMs correlate better with humans in reading but not strongly overall.

Conclusion: LLMs should not replace human participants in piloting educational assessments without further calibration or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Knowing how test takers answer items in educational assessments is essential
for test development, to evaluate item quality, and to improve test validity.
However, this process usually requires extensive pilot studies with human
participants. If large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like response
behavior to test items, this could open up the possibility of using them as
pilot participants to accelerate test development. In this paper, we evaluate
the human-likeness or psychometric plausibility of responses from 18
instruction-tuned LLMs with two publicly available datasets of multiple-choice
test items across three subjects: reading, U.S. history, and economics. Our
methodology builds on two theoretical frameworks from psychometrics which are
commonly used in educational assessment, classical test theory and item
response theory. The results show that while larger models are excessively
confident, their response distributions can be more human-like when calibrated
with temperature scaling. In addition, we find that LLMs tend to correlate
better with humans in reading comprehension items compared to other subjects.
However, the correlations are not very strong overall, indicating that LLMs
should not be used for piloting educational assessments in a zero-shot setting.

### [164] [CoRT: Code-integrated Reasoning within Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09820)
*Chengpeng Li,Zhengyang Tang,Ziniu Li,Mingfeng Xue,Keqin Bao,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Benyou Wang,Xiang Wang,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoRT is a post-training framework that improves Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by teaching them to use Code Interpreters (CI) efficiently, achieving significant accuracy and efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs struggle with complex math operations despite progress in natural language reasoning. Integrating computational tools like CI is challenging due to inefficiency in combining external knowledge with internal text representations.

Method: CoRT uses Hint-Engineering to synthesize code-integrated reasoning data, post-training models (1.5B to 32B parameters) with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.

Result: Hint-Engineering models achieve 4-8% absolute improvements in accuracy and reduce token usage by 30-50% compared to natural language models.

Conclusion: CoRT effectively bridges LRMs and CI, enhancing performance and efficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable
progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet
they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical
operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g.,
computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a
technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the
model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not
efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching
LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address
the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through
Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate
positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality
samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters,
with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.
Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\%
and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about
30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model
compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at
https://github.com/ChengpengLi1003/CoRT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoNet-Voice introduces a new benchmark for speech emotion recognition, featuring a large-scale dataset (EmoNet-Voice Big) and a benchmark (EmoNet-Voice Bench) with fine-grained emotion categories. It uses synthetic audio and expert validation, achieving high accuracy with Empathic Insight Voice models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SER datasets lack emotional granularity, privacy, or rely on acted portrayals. EmoNet-Voice addresses these gaps with a synthetic, privacy-preserving approach.

Method: Created EmoNet-Voice Big (4,500+ hours of speech) and EmoNet-Voice Bench with expert annotations. Used synthetic audio snippets and expert validation for fine-grained emotion detection.

Result: Empathic Insight Voice models achieved high agreement with human experts, with high-arousal emotions like anger easier to detect than low-arousal states.

Conclusion: EmoNet-Voice sets a new standard for SER, offering a privacy-preserving, fine-grained benchmark with synthetic data and expert validation.

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates
robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI
systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit
limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted
portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech
emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training
dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions,
and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human
expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a
fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of
intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic
audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific
emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who
assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving
approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in
existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set
a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human
experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable
findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect
than low-arousal states like concentration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data imbalance and detecting subtle movement errors in home-based rehabilitation assessment.

Method: Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA) simulates biomechanical errors, paired with an attention-based graph convolutional network.

Result: Reduces mean absolute error by 27.6% and boosts error classification accuracy by 45.8%.

Conclusion: EGPA enhances automated movement quality assessment in clinical and home-based rehabilitation.

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation assessment is essential for monitoring patient
progress, particularly in home-based settings. Existing systems often face
challenges such as data imbalance and difficulty detecting subtle movement
errors. This paper introduces Error-Guided Pose Augmentation (EGPA), a method
that generates synthetic skeleton data by simulating clinically relevant
movement mistakes. Unlike standard augmentation techniques, EGPA targets
biomechanical errors observed in rehabilitation. Combined with an
attention-based graph convolutional network, EGPA improves performance across
multiple evaluation metrics. Experiments demonstrate reductions in mean
absolute error of up to 27.6 percent and gains in error classification accuracy
of 45.8 percent. Attention visualizations show that the model learns to focus
on clinically significant joints and movement phases, enhancing both accuracy
and interpretability. EGPA offers a promising approach for improving automated
movement quality assessment in both clinical and home-based rehabilitation
contexts.

*Tomas Peterka,Matyas Bohacek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for detecting misattributed imagery in news, focusing on location and date relevance, and evaluates LLMs for these tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in detecting out-of-context and misattributed imagery, which current methods often miss by focusing only on semantic correspondence.

Method: Introduces the News Media Provenance Dataset with provenance-tagged images and formulates two tasks: LOR and DTOR. Evaluates six LLMs for baseline performance.

Result: Zero-shot performance on LOR is promising, but DTOR performance is lacking, indicating need for specialized solutions.

Conclusion: The dataset and tasks highlight challenges in detecting media manipulation, with DTOR requiring further research and improved architectures.

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media
manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The
existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether
the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing
manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to
the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance
Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate
two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time
of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language
models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is
promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized
architectures and future work.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal framework to address the challenges of sufficiency and necessity in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for LLMs, improving reasoning efficiency and reducing token usage without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CoT prompting by ensuring comprehensive and essential intermediate steps in reasoning, addressing the limitations of current methods.

Method: Proposes a causal framework using Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity to quantify step influence, enabling automated step addition and pruning.

Result: Substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage on mathematical and commonsense benchmarks, without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework offers a promising approach to enhance LLM reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing
large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT
currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that
the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and
substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the
inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting
answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through
the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability
of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are
logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to
quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different
intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing
steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on
various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial
improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without
sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM
reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

*Rodion Oblovatny,Alexandra Bazarova,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel method detects hallucinations in LLMs by analyzing probabilistic divergence between prompt and response hidden-state distributions, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting hallucinations in LLMs without relying on external knowledge or auxiliary models.

Method: Analyzes divergence between prompt and response hidden-state distributions, using deep learnable kernels for nuanced differences.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, scalable solution for hallucination detection, even without kernel training.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language
models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and
response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that
hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared
to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from
superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this
insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional
distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external
knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable
kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences
between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method
remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable
solution for hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs develop a core language-agnostic parameter space, with shared neurons increasing in importance over time, enabling abstract thought beyond specific languages. Neuron-specific training strategies are proposed and validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that LLMs 'think' in English by investigating their multilingual performance and identifying a language-agnostic parameter space.

Method: Identify and categorize language-related neurons (shared or exclusive), analyze their evolution, and propose neuron-specific training strategies.

Result: Shared neurons grow in importance, forming a core language-agnostic space, while exclusive neurons diminish. Proposed training strategies improve performance.

Conclusion: LLMs develop abstract thought through shared neurons, and tailored training enhances their multilingual capabilities.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to
function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked
improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs
often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has
led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However,
more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing
English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.
In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic
parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation
results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This
compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to
generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract
thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we
identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the
processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared
(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs
undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both
the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive
neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute
the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the
emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose
neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels
at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families
support our approach.

TL;DR: PersonaLens is a benchmark for evaluating personalization in task-oriented AI assistants, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by incorporating diverse user profiles and LLM-based agents for assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for personalization in AI assistants are limited to chit-chat or narrow domains, failing to capture the complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance.

Method: Introduces PersonaLens, featuring diverse user profiles and two LLM-based agents: a user agent for dialogues and a judge agent for evaluation.

Result: Experiments show significant variability in personalization capabilities of current LLM assistants.

Conclusion: PersonaLens provides crucial insights for advancing conversational AI systems by addressing the challenge of evaluating personalization in task-oriented assistants.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants.
However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply
personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing
tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on
chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the
complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we
introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization
in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles
equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two
specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic
task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the
LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task
success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across
diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization
capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI
systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes ASESUM, a novel summarization system for online reviews that captures aspect-centric opinions with supporting evidence, adapts to domains without predefined aspects, and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The vast number of online reviews makes manual summarization impractical, and existing methods struggle with grounded aspect-centric summaries.

Method: The ASESUM framework extracts aspect-centric arguments, measures their salience and validity, and adapts to varying domains.

Result: Experiments on a real-world dataset show ASESUM's superiority in capturing diverse review perspectives.

Conclusion: ASESUM effectively automates opinion summarization by focusing on critical aspects and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reviews are valuable resources for customers making purchase decisions in
online shopping. However, it is impractical for customers to go over the vast
number of reviews and manually conclude the prominent opinions, which prompts
the need for automated opinion summarization systems. Previous approaches,
either extractive or abstractive, face challenges in automatically producing
grounded aspect-centric summaries. In this paper, we propose a novel
summarization system that not only captures predominant opinions from an aspect
perspective with supporting evidence, but also adapts to varying domains
without relying on a pre-defined set of aspects. Our proposed framework,
ASESUM, summarizes viewpoints relevant to the critical aspects of a product by
extracting aspect-centric arguments and measuring their salience and validity.
We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset to demonstrate the superiority
of our approach in capturing diverse perspectives of the original reviews
compared to new and existing methods.

TL;DR: The paper introduces VerIF, a verification method combining rule-based and LLM-based verification for reinforcement learning in instruction following, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of verification in reinforcement learning for instruction following.

Method: Proposes VerIF, integrating rule-based code verification and LLM-based verification, and constructs the VerInstruct dataset (22,000 instances).

Result: Significant improvements in benchmarks, state-of-the-art performance, and maintained general capabilities.

Conclusion: VerIF enhances RL performance without compromising general capabilities, with released resources for future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key
technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification
engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in
instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the
verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a
verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based
verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this
approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset,
VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated
verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving
significant improvements across several representative instruction-following
benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models
of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further
observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL
with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model
performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate
future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

TL;DR: The paper introduces QRHEAD and QR-RETRIEVER, improving retrieval in long-context LMs by focusing on query-attention aggregation, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance retrieval of salient information in long-context LMs by identifying and leveraging query-focused attention heads.

Method: Identify QRHEAD via query-attention aggregation, then develop QR-RETRIEVER for efficient retrieval using attention mass. Tested on tasks like long-context QA and multi-hop reasoning.

Result: Over 10% performance gains on LongMemEval and CLIPPER, strong zero-shot performance on BEIR, outperforming RankGPT.

Conclusion: QRHEAD and QR-RETRIEVER improve retrieval and interpretability in long-context LMs, offering a general-purpose solution.

Abstract: Recent work has identified retrieval heads (Wu et al., 2025b), a subset of
attention heads responsible for retrieving salient information in long-context
language models (LMs), as measured by their copy-paste behavior in
Needle-in-a-Haystack tasks. In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused
Retrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from
long context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect
to the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,
long-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and
effective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as
retrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting
the most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop
reasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains
over full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate
QRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves
strong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as
RankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring
and task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream
utility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers
interpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.

TL;DR: Resa, a family of 1.5B reasoning models, uses sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) to efficiently elicit strong reasoning in language models, achieving high performance at minimal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To cost-effectively enhance reasoning abilities in language models by leveraging their underlying representations without requiring reasoning traces.

Method: SAE-Tuning: trains a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to capture reasoning abilities from a source model, then uses the SAE to guide supervised fine-tuning of a target model.

Result: Achieves >97% of RL-trained performance at 2000x lower cost (~$1) and 450x faster (~20 minutes). Enables 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for ~$1.

Conclusion: SAE-Tuning is efficient, generalizable, and modular, with extracted reasoning abilities transferable across models and datasets without retraining.

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by
leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa,
a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse
autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to
capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE
to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in
a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning
traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL
post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's
reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1
and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to
lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning
performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only
around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via
SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities
extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and
overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math
can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,
and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all
artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Detecting AI-generated social media posts is challenging due to short, informal text. A dataset of 505,159 posts shows detection drops when attackers don't share fine-tuned models, confirmed by human studies. Fine-tuning vulnerabilities impact all detection domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media is a key attack vector for influence campaigns using AI-generated posts, necessitating detection despite challenges like short, informal text.

Method: Created a dataset of 505,159 AI-generated posts from various LLMs across 11 topics, testing detection under realistic assumptions (no public model access).

Result: Detection is feasible with known models but drops significantly without access to fine-tuned models, confirmed by human studies. Fine-tuning vulnerabilities are widespread.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning LLMs complicates detection, impacting all domains. Realistic threat scenarios require new detection approaches.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is a difficult problem to begin with; detecting
AI-generated text on social media is made even more difficult due to the short
text length and informal, idiosyncratic language of the internet. It is
nonetheless important to tackle this problem, as social media represents a
significant attack vector in online influence campaigns, which may be bolstered
through the use of mass-produced AI-generated posts supporting (or opposing)
particular policies, decisions, or events. We approach this problem with the
mindset and resources of a reasonably sophisticated threat actor, and create a
dataset of 505,159 AI-generated social media posts from a combination of
open-source, closed-source, and fine-tuned LLMs, covering 11 different
controversial topics. We show that while the posts can be detected under
typical research assumptions about knowledge of and access to the generating
models, under the more realistic assumption that an attacker will not release
their fine-tuned model to the public, detectability drops dramatically. This
result is confirmed with a human study. Ablation experiments highlight the
vulnerability of various detection algorithms to fine-tuned LLMs. This result
has implications across all detection domains, since fine-tuning is a generally
applicable and realistic LLM use case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard prompting in LLMs often fails to produce structurally valid outputs for dependency parsing, necessitating a more effective method.

Method: Proposes a step-by-step approach: universal POS tagging first, then predicting syntactic heads and dependency labels, using a simplified CoNLL-U format.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets in 17 languages, with no hallucination or contamination. Multilingual fine-tuning enhances cross-language generalization.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning steps in LLM-based parsing are effective, offering a scalable and format-consistent alternative to bracket-based methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled impressive
performance in various tasks. However, standard prompting often struggles to
produce structurally valid and accurate outputs, especially in dependency
parsing. We propose a novel step-by-step instruction strategy, where universal
part-of-speech tagging precedes the prediction of syntactic heads and
dependency labels, and a simplified CoNLL-U like output format, our method
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on Universal Dependencies datasets across 17
languages without hallucination or contamination. We further show that
multilingual fine-tuning simultaneously improves cross-language generalization
performance. Our results highlight the effectiveness of explicit reasoning
steps in LLM-based parsing and offer a scalable, format-consistent alternative
to bracket-based approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates large language models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3 Opus) for detecting toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian. Context-augmented prompts improved recall and F1 scores, with Gemini performing best. Practical strategies like prompt design and threshold calibration are suggested.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online toxic language harms communities, especially in regions with limited moderation tools and labeled data (e.g., Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian).

Method: Built a manually labeled dataset of 4,500 YouTube/TikTok comments. Tested four models in zero-shot and context-augmented modes, measuring precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and false positives.

Result: Context-augmented mode improved recall (by ~0.12) and F1 (up to 0.10). Gemini (context-augmented) achieved F1=0.82, accuracy=0.82. GPT-4.1 (zero-shot) had highest precision and lowest false alarms.

Conclusion: Adding minimal context improves toxic language detection in low-resource settings. Prompt design and threshold calibration are practical strategies for underserved Balkan language communities.

Abstract: Online toxic language causes real harm, especially in regions with limited
moderation tools. In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle
toxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited
labeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and
TikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,
politics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and
general topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude
3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured
precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a
short context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1
score by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best
balance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of
0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the
lowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic
language detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies
such as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show
that prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for
underserved Balkan language communities.

### [179] [From Judgment to Interference: Early Stopping LLM Harmful Outputs via Streaming Content Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09996)
*Yang Li,Qiang Sheng,Yehan Yang,Xueyao Zhang,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a streaming content monitor (SCM) for partial detection of harmful content in LLM outputs, reducing latency while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing moderation methods for LLMs either cause high latency (full detection) or suffer from performance gaps (partial detection with full-detection-trained moderators).

Method: Constructs FineHarm, a dataset with fine-grained annotations, and proposes SCM, trained with dual supervision for token-level harmfulness detection.

Result: SCM achieves 0.95+ macro F1 score by analyzing only 18% of tokens, comparable to full detection, and improves safety alignment.

Conclusion: SCM effectively balances latency and accuracy for real-time moderation and enhances LLM safety alignment.

Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models
(LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the
external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly
practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based
on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more
attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway
and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply
moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs,
introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this
paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports
partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of
29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable
supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content
monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level
labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of
harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is
comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in
responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness
annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness
score than DPO.

*Delower Hossain,Ehsan Saghapour,Kevin Song,Jake Y. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LlamaAffinity, an AI-based model for predicting antibody-antigen binding affinity, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional experimental methods for measuring antibody affinity are slow and costly, prompting the need for AI-driven solutions.

Method: The model uses a Llama 3 backbone and antibody sequence data from the OAS database to predict binding affinity.

Result: LlamaAffinity achieved high accuracy (0.9640), F1-score (0.9643), and computational efficiency (0.46 hours training time).

Conclusion: The model demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods, offering a faster and more accurate tool for antibody research.

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense
against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of
antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for
maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements
have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These
antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating
cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases.
Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been
time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in
silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine
learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing
antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved
affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding
affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3
backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space
(OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy)
across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an
accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of
0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher
computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of
only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

*Jiaxiang Chen,Mingxi Zou,Zhuo Wang,Qifan Wang,Dongning Sun,Chi Zhang,Zenglin Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FinHEAR is a multi-agent framework combining LLMs and behavioral economics to improve financial decision-making, outperforming baselines in accuracy and risk-adjusted returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of LLMs in capturing human financial decision-making behaviors like expert reliance, loss aversion, and adaptive reasoning.

Method: FinHEAR uses specialized LLM-based agents for historical trend analysis, event interpretation, and expert-informed precedent retrieval, incorporating behavioral economics principles.

Result: Empirical results show FinHEAR outperforms baselines in trend prediction and trading tasks with higher accuracy and better risk-adjusted returns.

Conclusion: FinHEAR enhances interpretability and robustness in financial decision-making by integrating human expertise and adaptive risk-aware reasoning.

Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models,
demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to
dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general
reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central
to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information
asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We
propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive
Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to
analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve
expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in
behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval,
confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance
interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial
datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across
trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better
risk-adjusted returns.

*Xinyuan Wang,Liang Wu,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PageLLM uses user feedback and a dual-reward mechanism to fine-tune LLMs for Whole Page Optimization, improving search and recommendation results without costly human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs for WPO is expensive due to the need for human-annotated data. User feedback offers a scalable but noisy alternative.

Method: Proposes PageLLM, a reward-based fine-tuning approach with page-level and item-level rewards to optimize both overall coherence and individual recommendation accuracy.

Result: PageLLM outperforms baselines, achieving a 0.44% GMV increase in a large-scale A/B test.

Conclusion: PageLLM effectively leverages user feedback for WPO, demonstrating practical impact in real-world systems.

Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial
to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO)
plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information
is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually
relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents
challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to
mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be
prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with
millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning
LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled
datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this,
we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a
mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards.
The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the
item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations.
This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the
critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both
public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a
0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users,
demonstrating its real-world impact.

### [183] [LLM-ML Teaming: Integrated Symbolic Decoding and Gradient Search for Valid and Stable Generative Feature Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09085)
*Xinyuan Wang,Haoyue Bai,Nanxu Gong,Wangyang Ying,Sixun Dong,Xiquan Cui,Yanjie Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A teaming framework combines LLMs and ML for stable and valid feature transformation, improving downstream performance by 5% and reducing errors by half.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (traditional ML and LLMs) fail to resolve challenges of stable and valid feature transformation in generative AI.

Method: Proposes a four-step framework: golden examples generation, feature transformation sequence embedding/search, student LLM feature transformation, and LLM-ML decoder teaming.

Result: Achieves 5% improvement in downstream performance and reduces error cases by nearly half. Demonstrates efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: The teaming policy effectively bridges the gap between LLMs and ML, enhancing feature transformation with stable and valid outputs.

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features
from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces
challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation
(error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and
LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax,
while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap,
we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's
gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples
generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of
the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search,
intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space;
(3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the
teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the
student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on
various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in
downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The
results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy.
Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand
the original data.

*Sophie Jaffard,Giulia Mezzadri,Patricia Reynaud-Bouret,Etienne Tanré*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for decision-making, bridging cognitive and biological models by incorporating learning mechanisms and multivariate Hawkes processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of learning mechanisms in existing models (DDM and Poisson counter) and integrate biologically relevant neural mechanisms into cognitive models.

Method: Develops an SNN model with neurons modeled by multivariate Hawkes processes, shows coupling between DDM and Poisson counter models, and derives a DDM with correlated noise from a Hawkes network. Evaluates with an online categorization task.

Result: Demonstrates that DDM and Poisson counter models provide similar categorizations and reaction times, and that a DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons.

Conclusion: The work advances the integration of neural mechanisms into cognitive models, enhancing understanding of neural activity and behavior.

Abstract: In cognition, response times and choices in decision-making tasks are
commonly modeled using Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs), which describe the
accumulation of evidence for a decision as a stochastic process, specifically a
Brownian motion, with the drift rate reflecting the strength of the evidence.
In the same vein, the Poisson counter model describes the accumulation of
evidence as discrete events whose counts over time are modeled as Poisson
processes, and has a spiking neurons interpretation as these processes are used
to model neuronal activities. However, these models lack a learning mechanism
and are limited to tasks where participants have prior knowledge of the
categories. To bridge the gap between cognitive and biological models, we
propose a biologically plausible Spiking Neural Network (SNN) model for
decision-making that incorporates a learning mechanism and whose neurons
activities are modeled by a multivariate Hawkes process. First, we show a
coupling result between the DDM and the Poisson counter model, establishing
that these two models provide similar categorizations and reaction times and
that the DDM can be approximated by spiking Poisson neurons. To go further, we
show that a particular DDM with correlated noise can be derived from a Hawkes
network of spiking neurons governed by a local learning rule. In addition, we
designed an online categorization task to evaluate the model predictions. This
work provides a significant step toward integrating biologically relevant
neural mechanisms into cognitive models, fostering a deeper understanding of
the relationship between neural activity and behavior.

*Arthur Oghlukyan,Nuria Gomez Blas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An enhanced asynchronous AdaBoost framework for federated learning is proposed, improving efficiency and robustness across five domains with adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of synchronization frequency and communication overhead in federated learning while maintaining or enhancing model accuracy.

Method: Incorporates adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce synchronization and communication costs. Evaluated across five domains using comparative metrics.

Result: Achieves 20-35% training time reduction, 30-40% communication overhead reduction, and faster convergence compared to baseline AdaBoost.

Conclusion: The enhanced AdaBoost framework demonstrates significant efficiency and robustness improvements, making it broadly applicable in diverse federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of an enhanced asynchronous
AdaBoost framework for federated learning (FL), focusing on its application
across five distinct domains: computer vision on edge devices, blockchain-based
model transparency, on-device mobile personalization, IoT anomaly detection,
and federated healthcare diagnostics. The proposed algorithm incorporates
adaptive communication scheduling and delayed weight compensation to reduce
synchronization frequency and communication overhead while preserving or
improving model accuracy. We examine how these innovations improve
communication efficiency, scalability, convergence, and robustness in each
domain. Comparative metrics including training time, communication overhead,
convergence iterations, and classification accuracy are evaluated using data
and estimates derived from Oghlukyan's enhanced AdaBoost framework. Empirical
results show, for example, training time reductions on the order of 20-35% and
communication overhead reductions of 30-40% compared to baseline AdaBoost, with
convergence achieved in significantly fewer boosting rounds. Tables and charts
summarize these improvements by domain. Mathematical formulations of the
adaptive scheduling rule and error-driven synchronization thresholds are
provided. Overall, the enhanced AdaBoost exhibits markedly improved efficiency
and robustness across diverse FL scenarios, suggesting broad applicability of
the approach.

TL;DR: An optimization framework for variational inference using coupled free energy improves model accuracy and robustness, especially for heavy-tailed distributions, demonstrated by a 3% improvement in a CVAE over VAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend variational inference to handle the curved geometry of coupled exponential family distributions, including heavy-tailed ones like generalized Pareto and Student's t, to enhance model robustness.

Method: Leverages coupled free energy and ELBO, generalizes Fisher Information metric, and applies to a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE) with modified reconstruction metrics.

Result: CVAE shows a 3% improvement over VAE in Wasserstein-2 or Fréchet Inception Distance for reconstructed CelebA images after 5 epochs.

Conclusion: The framework successfully improves variational inference for heavy-tailed distributions, reducing outliers and enhancing training stability.

Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the
coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for
the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes
important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the
Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the
coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve
the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of
Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to
the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling
for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is
derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The
novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its
associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is
the ability to train a model with high penalties in the tails, while assuring
that the training samples have a reduced number of outliers. The Wasserstein-2
or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the
CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR) framework to enhance LLMs for generating and optimizing high-performance CUDA programs for GPUs, achieving significant speedups over human-written code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical GPU code remains a challenge for LLMs.

Method: Proposes the FSR framework to jointly optimize compilation, correctness, and runtime performance, validated through diverse test cases and actual GPU execution.

Result: LLMs with FSR achieve high correctness rates and generate kernels up to 179x faster than human-written code.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs with performance reinforcement like FSR can automate GPU programming for demanding applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply
hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for
massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore
the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs,
with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the
underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework
called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes
compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance,
which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by
actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach
enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA
code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the
characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA
kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our
results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness
rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general
human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These
findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance
reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific,
architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes LwPTV, a layer-wise pruning method for task vectors in multi-task learning, improving out-of-domain performance while maintaining in-domain effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model merging methods focus on in-domain performance, neglecting out-of-domain efficacy.

Method: LwPTV uses saliency scores to prune redundant parameters in task vectors, creating mask vectors for layer-wise pruning.

Result: Significant improvement in out-of-domain performance without compromising in-domain results.

Conclusion: LwPTV enhances flexibility and performance in multi-task learning, compatible with existing merging methods.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task
datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance
across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple
independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing
the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of
MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on
enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their
efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV
(Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the
redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve
mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task
vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding
layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly
integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their
performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD
performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

*Chaoyang Zhou,Shunyu Liu,Zengmao Wang,Di Wang,Rong-Cheng Tu,Bo Du,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using generation probabilities to improve reward models in LLMs by enforcing intra-trajectory consistency, leading to better generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models rely on coarse-grained response-level scores, which struggle to identify specific components correlating with rewards, limiting generalization.

Method: Leverages generation probabilities to propagate fine-grained signals, introduces intra-trajectory consistency regularization under a Bayesian framework.

Result: Improves performance on RewardBench, enhances DPO-aligned policies, and achieves better best-of-N inference results.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively refines reward models, offering better generalization and performance in LLM training and verification.

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs),
particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or
inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores
of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However,
since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the
reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response
trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization
on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation
probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response
trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate
across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward
learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an
intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes
with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards.
We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model,
improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward
model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned
policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification
results. Our code is provided in https://github.com/chaoyang101/ICRM.

*Joshua Barron,Devin White*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the trade-off between memorization and generalization in LLMs, showing that model size affects their ability to perform arithmetic extrapolation (generalization) or factual recall (memorization).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how memorization and generalization interact in LLMs and how model capacity influences these learning modes.

Method: Pre-training capacity-limited Transformer models on synthetic tasks: arithmetic extrapolation (generalization) and factual recall (memorization).

Result: Small models generalize but fail to memorize; larger models memorize but fail to generalize. Joint training prevents extrapolation regardless of model size.

Conclusion: Pre-training may inherently favor one learning mode over the other, impacting the design of small language models.

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language
models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the
two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by
pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on
two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization
(via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We
observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic
cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to
extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward
memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size)
succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may
intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these
dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model
capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the
design and deployment of small language models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unified threat model for evaluating jailbreaking attacks on LLMs, using an N-gram language model for interpretable and LLM-agnostic analysis. It finds discrete optimization attacks outperform LLM-based ones and identifies infrequent bigrams as key attack vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled comparison of jailbreaking attacks on safety-tuned LLMs, addressing inconsistencies in fluency and computational effort across methods.

Method: Develops an N-gram language model on 1T tokens for LLM-agnostic, nonparametric evaluation, adapting popular attacks to this model for benchmarking.

Result: Attack success rates are lower than previously reported; discrete optimization attacks outperform LLM-based ones, with effective attacks exploiting rare bigrams.

Conclusion: The threat model offers interpretable analysis, revealing infrequent bigrams as critical for successful jailbreaking attacks.

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful
responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the
target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially
in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat
model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks
if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this,
we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based
perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently
interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and,
for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an
extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern
models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete
optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being
inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis
and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and
abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text
or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

TL;DR: FSL-Net is a neural network designed to accurately and efficiently localize feature shifts in large, high-dimensional datasets without requiring re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature shifts in heterogeneous data sources degrade downstream analysis, but current methods for localizing these shifts are either inaccurate or unscalable.

Method: FSL-Net is trained on diverse datasets to learn statistical properties, enabling it to localize shifts in unseen data without re-training.

Result: FSL-Net provides fast and accurate feature shift localization in large, high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: FSL-Net addresses the challenge of feature shift localization, offering a scalable and efficient solution for diverse applications.

Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications
involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and
multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources,
noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization
pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is
important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter
the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can
detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still
challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to
large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature
Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize
feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate
manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract
the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from
previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The

Conclusion: UPQ successfully quantizes instruction-tuned LLMs to INT2, demonstrating effectiveness without proprietary data.

Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant
challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing
interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works
have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller
counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited
to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models.
To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel
progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2)
that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with
distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2
instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned
models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization
error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT
to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with
their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon
divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs
to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving
state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most
representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

### [194] [MetaTT: A Global Tensor-Train Adapter for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09105)
*Javier Lopez-Piqueres,Pranav Deshpande,Archan Ray,Mattia J. Villani,Marco Pistoia,Niraj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaTT is a Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for efficient low-rank fine-tuning of transformers, outperforming LoRA and other methods in parameter reduction while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of independent fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) by unifying transformer sub-modules into a single shared TT structure, reducing parameters and simplifying training.

Method: MetaTT factorizes all transformer sub-modules (query, key, value, etc.) using a single TT, indexing structural axes like layer and matrix type. It leverages mature optimization routines like DMRG-style rank adaptation.

Result: MetaTT significantly reduces parameters compared to LoRA while maintaining similar accuracy, outperforming other tensor-based methods on language modeling benchmarks.

Conclusion: MetaTT offers a scalable, efficient fine-tuning solution with shared adapters across tasks, benefiting from TT's optimization advantages.

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global
low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes
each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize
all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward
layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and
optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters
proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters
proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed
final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent
state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We
observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads
to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to
LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other
rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines
-- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we
find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT
naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the
core tensor.

TL;DR: SensorLM is a sensor-language model for interpreting wearable sensor data with natural language, using a hierarchical caption pipeline to create a large dataset and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning and interpreting sensor data with language is challenging due to the lack of annotated sensor-text pairs in real-world wearable data.

Method: A hierarchical caption generation pipeline captures statistical, structural, and semantic information from sensor data, and extends multimodal pretraining architectures like CLIP and CoCa.

Result: SensorLM achieves superior performance in zero-shot recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval, and shows capabilities like scaling behaviors and zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: SensorLM advances sensor-language understanding and demonstrates strong performance and versatility in real-world applications.

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that
enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its
pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains
challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text
descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a
hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical,
structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled
the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over
59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM
extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and
recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive
experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare
verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot
recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also
demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label
efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

*Jingying Ma,Feng Wu,Qika Lin,Yucheng Xing,Chenyu Liu,Ziyu Jia,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CodeBrain is an efficient EEG foundation model (EFM) that addresses limitations in traditional EEG models by using a two-stage approach: a TFDual-Tokenizer for heterogeneous temporal and frequency components and an EEGSSM for multi-scale dependency modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional EEG models struggle with transferability due to variations in channel configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives. Existing EFMs lack heterogeneous representation capacity and efficiency in capturing multi-scale brain dependencies.

Method: CodeBrain uses a TFDual-Tokenizer to tokenize temporal and frequency components separately, expanding the representation space. It also employs EEGSSM, combining global convolution and sliding window attention, to model sparse long-range and local dependencies.

Result: Experiments on 10 public EEG datasets show CodeBrain's generalizability with linear probing, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing multi-scale EEG structures.

Conclusion: CodeBrain provides a biologically informed, interpretable EEG modeling framework, paving the way for future neuroscience research. Code and pretraining weights will be released.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) provides real-time insights into brain activity
and is widely used in neuroscience. However, variations in channel
configurations, sequence lengths, and task objectives limit the transferability
of traditional task-specific models. Although recent EEG foundation models
(EFMs) aim to learn generalizable representations, they struggle with limited
heterogeneous representation capacity and inefficiency in capturing multi-scale
brain dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose CodeBrain, an
efficient EFM structurally aligned with brain organization, trained in two
stages. (1) We introduce a TFDual-Tokenizer that independently tokenizes
heterogeneous temporal and frequency components, enabling a quadratic expansion
of the discrete representation space. This also offers a degree of
interpretability through cross-domain token analysis. (2) We propose the
EEGSSM, which combines a structured global convolution architecture and a
sliding window attention mechanism to jointly model sparse long-range and local
dependencies. Unlike fully connected Transformer models, EEGSSM better reflects
the brain's small-world topology and efficiently captures EEG's inherent
multi-scale structure. EEGSSM is trained with a masked self-supervised learning
objective to predict token indices obtained in TFDual-Tokenizer. Comprehensive
experiments on 10 public EEG datasets demonstrate the generalizability of
CodeBrain with linear probing. By offering biologically informed and
interpretable EEG modeling, CodeBrain lays the foundation for future
neuroscience research. Both code and pretraining weights will be released in
the future version.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRACE is a multimodal retriever for time-series data, enabling fine-grained alignment with textual context and improving retrieval and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data, which is often tied to domain-specific contexts, remains underexplored. Existing methods lack semantic grounding and struggle with heterogeneous modalities.

Method: TRACE grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context, uses hard negative mining, and supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes (Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text).

Result: TRACE improves predictive accuracy and interpretability, achieving state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks like forecasting and classification.

Conclusion: TRACE serves as both a powerful encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever, enhancing time-series models across multiple domains.

Abstract: The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and
energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of
time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts,
such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval
essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust
time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite
the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored.
Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous
modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To
address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds
time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained
channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate
semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval
modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking
linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving
semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative
context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a
static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder,
with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware
representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These
representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting
and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains
highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream
applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models.

TL;DR: BSA-TNP is a scalable, accurate Neural Process model with translation invariance, efficient training, and support for high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the tradeoff between scalability and accuracy in Neural Processes, especially for translation-invariant processes.

Method: Introduces Kernel Regression Blocks, group-invariant attention biases, and Biased Scan Attention for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Matches or exceeds accuracy of top models, trains faster, handles high-dimensional data, and scales to 1M test points.

Conclusion: BSA-TNP eliminates unnecessary tradeoffs, offering a versatile, scalable solution for complex applications.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are a rapidly evolving class of models designed to
directly model the posterior predictive distribution of stochastic processes.
While early architectures were developed primarily as a scalable alternative to
Gaussian Processes (GPs), modern NPs tackle far more complex and data hungry
applications spanning geology, epidemiology, climate, and robotics. These
applications have placed increasing pressure on the scalability of these
models, with many architectures compromising accuracy for scalability. In this
paper, we demonstrate that this tradeoff is often unnecessary, particularly
when modeling fully or partially translation invariant processes. We propose a
versatile new architecture, the Biased Scan Attention Transformer Neural
Process (BSA-TNP), which introduces Kernel Regression Blocks (KRBlocks),
group-invariant attention biases, and memory-efficient Biased Scan Attention
(BSA). BSA-TNP is able to: (1) match or exceed the accuracy of the best models
while often training in a fraction of the time, (2) exhibit translation
invariance, enabling learning at multiple resolutions simultaneously, (3)
transparently model processes that evolve in both space and time, (4) support
high dimensional fixed effects, and (5) scale gracefully -- running inference
with over 1M test points with 100K context points in under a minute on a single
24GB GPU.

TL;DR: A novel LLM agent framework improves planning via in-context learning, atomic fact augmentation, and recursive lookahead search, enhancing adaptability and performance in interactive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitations of LLMs in adapting to new information and utilizing past experiences for multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning.

Method: Uses atomic fact augmentation and recursive lookahead search to dynamically enhance prompts for action proposal, world simulation, and state-value estimation.

Result: Empirical results show improved performance and adaptability in tasks like TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Conclusion: The framework enables online learning and refined decision-making without weight updates, linking performance to fact-based abstraction and simulation accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require
significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in
complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting
to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step
reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that
enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by
atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to
extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These
facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components
responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value
estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where
the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided
by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the
agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its
experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a
theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based
abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates
improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks,
achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in
tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

Result: MultiNet provides tools and data for evaluating VLMs and VLAs, aiding research on their generalization limitations.

TL;DR: CuriosiTree is a heuristic-based policy for zero-shot information acquisition in LLMs, using greedy tree search to balance information gain and cost, outperforming baselines in clinical diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-makers often lack sufficient information, requiring cost-effective methods to acquire it.

Method: CuriosiTree employs greedy tree search to estimate information gain and cost, selecting actions strategically.

Result: Empirical validation shows CuriosiTree outperforms baselines in cost-effective information acquisition for accurate diagnosis.

Conclusion: CuriosiTree effectively integrates heterogeneous information sources, improving decision-making in uncertain scenarios.

Abstract: Decision-makers often possess insufficient information to render a confident
decision. In these cases, the decision-maker can often undertake actions to
acquire the necessary information about the problem at hand, e.g., by
consulting knowledgeable authorities or by conducting experiments. Importantly,
different levers of information acquisition come with different costs, posing
the challenge of selecting the actions that are both informative and
cost-effective. In this work, we propose CuriosiTree, a heuristic-based,
test-time policy for zero-shot information acquisition in large language models
(LLMs). CuriosiTree employs a greedy tree search to estimate the expected
information gain of each action and strategically chooses actions based on a
balance of anticipated information gain and associated cost. Empirical
validation in a clinical diagnosis simulation shows that CuriosiTree enables
cost-effective integration of heterogenous sources of information, and
outperforms baseline action selection strategies in selecting action sequences
that enable accurate diagnosis.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FNF and DBD as dedicated backbones for multivariate long-term time series forecasting, addressing temporal dependencies and spatial correlations without auxiliary techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches repurpose NLP/CV backbones, lacking temporal-specific inductive biases, leading to inadequate handling of time series properties like periodicity.

Method: Proposes FNF for unified local/global information processing and DBD for superior gradient flow and representation capacity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 11 datasets shows state-of-the-art performance without auxiliary techniques.

Conclusion: Properly designed neural architectures can inherently capture time series properties, potentially transforming modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

Abstract: Multivariate long-term time series forecasting has been suffering from the
challenge of capturing both temporal dependencies within variables and spatial
correlations across variables simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly
repurpose backbones from natural language processing or computer vision (e.g.,
Transformers), which fail to adequately address the unique properties of time
series (e.g., periodicity). The research community lacks a dedicated backbone
with temporal-specific inductive biases, instead relying on domain-agnostic
backbones supplemented with auxiliary techniques (e.g., signal decomposition).
We introduce FNF as the backbone and DBD as the architecture to provide
excellent learning capabilities and optimal learning pathways for
spatio-temporal modeling, respectively. Our theoretical analysis proves that
FNF unifies local time-domain and global frequency-domain information
processing within a single backbone that extends naturally to spatial modeling,
while information bottleneck theory demonstrates that DBD provides superior
gradient flow and representation capacity compared to existing unified or
sequential architectures. Our empirical evaluation across 11 public benchmark
datasets spanning five domains (energy, meteorology, transportation,
environment, and nature) confirms state-of-the-art performance with consistent
hyperparameter settings. Notably, our approach achieves these results without
any auxiliary techniques, suggesting that properly designed neural
architectures can capture the inherent properties of time series, potentially
transforming time series modeling in scientific and industrial applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel RL method mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks, outperforming existing rating-based RL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLHF approaches simplify human reasoning by isolating tasks, missing the complexity of human decision-making.

Method: Proposes a reward-free RL method using human ratings to infer a reward function, balancing classification and regression models with learnable weights.

Result: Outperforms existing rating-based RL methods and sometimes traditional RL approaches.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures human decision-making uncertainty and adapts to varying strategies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in
aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate
multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often
simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such
as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly
considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in
reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable
weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression
models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making
and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct
several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms
existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional
RL approaches.

TL;DR: LaDCast is a global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range ensemble weather forecasting, achieving accuracy and efficiency by operating in a learned latent space, outperforming traditional methods in extreme event tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of high accuracy and efficient uncertainty quantification in weather forecasting, which overburden traditional NWP and machine-learning methods.

Method: Uses an autoencoder to compress weather data into a latent space, a transformer-based diffusion model for sequential updates, and incorporates GeoRoPE, dual-stream attention, and temporal embeddings.

Result: Matches the skill of IFS-ENS in deterministic and probabilistic forecasting, excels in tracking extreme events like cyclones, and reduces computational costs significantly.

Conclusion: LaDCast offers a scalable and efficient solution for high-resolution weather forecasting, with open-source availability for broader use.

Abstract: Accurate probabilistic weather forecasting demands both high accuracy and
efficient uncertainty quantification, challenges that overburden both ensemble
numerical weather prediction (NWP) and recent machine-learning methods. We
introduce LaDCast, the first global latent-diffusion framework for medium-range
ensemble forecasting, which generates hourly ensemble forecasts entirely in a
learned latent space. An autoencoder compresses high-dimensional ERA5
reanalysis fields into a compact representation, and a transformer-based
diffusion model produces sequential latent updates with arbitrary hour
initialization. The model incorporates Geometric Rotary Position Embedding
(GeoRoPE) to account for the Earth's spherical geometry, a dual-stream
attention mechanism for efficient conditioning, and sinusoidal temporal
embeddings to capture seasonal patterns. LaDCast achieves deterministic and
probabilistic skill close to that of the European Centre for Medium-Range
Forecast IFS-ENS, without any explicit perturbations. Notably, LaDCast
demonstrates superior performance in tracking rare extreme events such as
cyclones, capturing their trajectories more accurately than established models.
By operating in latent space, LaDCast reduces storage and compute by orders of
magnitude, demonstrating a practical path toward forecasting at kilometer-scale
resolution in real time. We open-source our code and models and provide the
training and evaluation pipelines at: https://github.com/tonyzyl/ladcast.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLoRIST is a federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs using LoRA, addressing challenges in communication efficiency, accuracy, and computational cost by avoiding full global weight-update matrix construction and using efficient decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated LoRA methods struggle with balancing communication efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, especially in heterogeneous settings.

Method: FLoRIST avoids constructing the full global weight-update matrix, instead using singular value decomposition on stacked local adapters in a compact intermediate space and tunable singular value thresholding for optimal rank selection.

Result: FLoRIST achieves superior communication efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous setups.

Conclusion: FLoRIST effectively balances communication efficiency and model performance in federated fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a
promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models
(LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for
federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication
efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among
heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of
local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large
stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or
necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and
performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific
low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning
framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring
high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full
global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient
decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked
local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate
space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce
tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to
construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive
empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that
FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication
efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous
setups.

*Hao Hu,Xinqi Wang,Simon Shaolei Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline RL datasets, proposing two methods (PG-Kmeans and CAAE) to achieve this. Theoretically, it addresses convergence and ambiguity challenges, and experimentally validates the methods on D4RL and GridWorld datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To cluster trajectories in offline RL datasets by identifying policies that generated them, leveraging KL-divergence and policy-induced distributions.

Method: Proposes PG-Kmeans (iterative BC policy training and trajectory assignment) and CAAE (VQ-VAE-like framework for clustering).

Result: Both methods effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters, validated on D4RL and GridWorld datasets.

Conclusion: PG-Kmeans and CAAE provide a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with potential applications in offline RL and beyond.

Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline
reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the
policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between
the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of
policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To
solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted
Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies
and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE
resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of
trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve
clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans
and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent
ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can
result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings.
Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and
custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE
effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a
promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad
applications in offline RL and beyond.

Abstract: Determining accurate numerical solutions of partial differential equations
(PDEs) is an important task in many scientific disciplines. However, solvers
can be computationally expensive, leading to the development of reduced-order
models (ROMs). Recently, Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) was
proposed as a data-driven, non-intrusive ROM framework. LaSDI compresses the
training data using an autoencoder and learns a system of user-chosen ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), which govern the latent space dynamics. This
allows for rapid predictions by interpolating and evolving the low-dimensional
ODEs in the latent space. While LaSDI has produced effective ROMs for numerous
problems, the autoencoder can have difficulty accurately reconstructing
training data while also satisfying the imposed dynamics in the latent space,
particularly in complex or high-frequency regimes. To address this, we propose
multi-stage Latent Space Dynamics Identification (mLaSDI). With mLaSDI, several
autoencoders are trained sequentially in stages, where each autoencoder learns
to correct the error of the previous stages. We find that applying mLaSDI with
small autoencoders results in lower prediction and reconstruction errors, while
also reducing training time compared to LaSDI.

### [209] [Robust Noise Attenuation via Adaptive Pooling of Transformer Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09215)
*Greyson Brothers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores pooling methods for transformer embeddings, highlighting vulnerabilities of standard methods (AvgPool, MaxPool, ClsToken) to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuations. It proposes an attention-based adaptive pooling method, validated theoretically and experimentally across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance collapse of standard pooling methods in transformer models when SNR fluctuates, particularly in reinforcement learning and vision applications.

Method: Frames pooling as vector quantization to minimize signal loss, introduces an attention-based adaptive pooling method, and validates it theoretically and experimentally.

Result: The adaptive pooling method approximates the signal-optimal quantizer within error bounds and shows superior robustness in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Attention-based adaptive pooling outperforms standard methods, offering robustness across varying SNR conditions in diverse applications.

Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of
transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and
vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input
vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the
rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with
the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods
used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are
vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs
fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can
approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for
any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments
on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to
standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision
benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling
display superior robustness across tasks.

### [210] [SoK: Machine Unlearning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09227)
*Jie Ren,Yue Xing,Yingqian Cui,Charu C. Aggarwal,Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new taxonomy for LLM unlearning based on the underlying intention (removal vs. suppression), critiques existing methods and evaluations, and highlights practical challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked dimension of intention in LLM unlearning and provide a clearer framework for future research and policy.

Method: Proposes an intention-oriented taxonomy, critiques removal vs. suppression methods, surveys evaluation strategies, and identifies practical challenges.

Result: Finds that many removal methods may act like suppression, identifies gaps in evaluation metrics, and notes scalability and sequential unlearning as key challenges.

Conclusion: Offers a framework to advance unlearning research, improve evaluations, and guide policy on data privacy.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical topic in machine
learning, aiming to eliminate the influence of specific training data or
knowledge without retraining the model from scratch. A variety of techniques
have been proposed, including Gradient Ascent, model editing, and re-steering
hidden representations. While existing surveys often organize these methods by
their technical characteristics, such classifications tend to overlook a more
fundamental dimension: the underlying intention of unlearning--whether it seeks
to truly remove internal knowledge or merely suppress its behavioral effects.
In this SoK paper, we propose a new taxonomy based on this intention-oriented
perspective. Building on this taxonomy, we make three key contributions. First,
we revisit recent findings suggesting that many removal methods may
functionally behave like suppression, and explore whether true removal is
necessary or achievable. Second, we survey existing evaluation strategies,
identify limitations in current metrics and benchmarks, and suggest directions
for developing more reliable and intention-aligned evaluations. Third, we
highlight practical challenges--such as scalability and support for sequential
unlearning--that currently hinder the broader deployment of unlearning methods.
In summary, this work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding and
advancing unlearning in generative AI, aiming to support future research and
guide policy decisions around data removal and privacy.

*Karl Löwenmark,Daniel Strömbergsson,Chang Liu,Marcus Liwicki,Fredrik Sandin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MindRAG integrates LLM-based reasoning with CM workflows to reduce false alarms, improve fault severity estimation, and enhance decision support using multimodal RAG techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CM systems rely heavily on human experts, exhibit uncertainty, and have high false alarm rates, reducing efficiency.

Method: Proposes MindRAG, a modular framework combining multimodal RAG with novel vector store structures for CM data, leveraging existing annotations and work orders.

Result: Preliminary results show MindRAG improves alarm management and interpretability of CM systems.

Conclusion: MindRAG effectively addresses CM challenges by integrating LLMs, offering practical and explainable solutions for industrial applications.

Abstract: Condition monitoring (CM) plays a crucial role in ensuring reliability and
efficiency in the process industry. Although computerised maintenance systems
effectively detect and classify faults, tasks like fault severity estimation,
and maintenance decisions still largely depend on human expert analysis. The
analysis and decision making automatically performed by current systems
typically exhibit considerable uncertainty and high false alarm rates, leading
to increased workload and reduced efficiency.
  This work integrates large language model (LLM)-based reasoning agents with
CM workflows to address analyst and industry needs, namely reducing false
alarms, enhancing fault severity estimation, improving decision support, and
offering explainable interfaces. We propose MindRAG, a modular framework
combining multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with novel vector
store structures designed specifically for CM data. The framework leverages
existing annotations and maintenance work orders as surrogates for labels in a
supervised learning protocol, addressing the common challenge of training
predictive models on unlabelled and noisy real-world datasets.
  The primary contributions include: (1) an approach for structuring industry
CM data into a semi-structured multimodal vector store compatible with
LLM-driven workflows; (2) developing multimodal RAG techniques tailored for CM
data; (3) developing practical reasoning agents capable of addressing
real-world CM queries; and (4) presenting an experimental framework for
integrating and evaluating such agents in realistic industrial scenarios.
Preliminary results, evaluated with the help of an experienced analyst,
indicate that MindRAG provide meaningful decision support for more efficient
management of alarms, thereby improving the interpretability of CM systems.

*Vaidotas Simkus,Michael U. Gutmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFMI is a new imputation method combining continuous normalising flows and flow-matching, outperforming traditional and modern techniques in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intractabilities in traditional multiple imputation methods and provide a scalable solution for various data types.

Method: Uses continuous normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling.

Result: CFMI matches or outperforms nine other methods on 24 datasets and excels in computational efficiency for time-series data.

Conclusion: CFMI is a versatile and scalable imputation method suitable for diverse data types and dimensionalities.

Abstract: We introduce conditional flow matching for imputation (CFMI), a new
general-purpose method to impute missing data. The method combines continuous
normalising flows, flow-matching, and shared conditional modelling to deal with
intractabilities of traditional multiple imputation. Our comparison with nine
classical and state-of-the-art imputation methods on 24 small to
moderate-dimensional tabular data sets shows that CFMI matches or outperforms
both traditional and modern techniques across a wide range of metrics. Applying
the method to zero-shot imputation of time-series data, we find that it matches
the accuracy of a related diffusion-based method while outperforming it in
terms of computational efficiency. Overall, CFMI performs at least as well as
traditional methods on lower-dimensional data while remaining scalable to
high-dimensional settings, matching or exceeding the performance of other deep
learning-based approaches, making it a go-to imputation method for a wide range
of data types and dimensionalities.

### [213] [Uncertainty Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09270)
*Rodrigo Carrasco-Davis,Sebastian Lee,Claudia Clopath,Will Dabney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using epistemic uncertainty to prioritize transitions in replay buffers, improving sample efficiency and reducing noise in value-based deep reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prioritization based on temporal difference error favors noisy transitions, disrupting learning. The paper aims to mitigate this by leveraging epistemic uncertainty.

Method: The authors use epistemic uncertainty estimation to guide transition prioritization, tested in tabular toy models and the Atari suite.

Result: The method outperforms benchmarks like quantile regression deep Q-learning, showing improved performance in noisy environments.

Conclusion: Epistemic uncertainty prioritization enhances reinforcement learning by reducing noise and improving sample efficiency, validated in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Prioritized experience replay, which improves sample efficiency by selecting
relevant transitions to update parameter estimates, is a crucial component of
contemporary value-based deep reinforcement learning models. Typically,
transitions are prioritized based on their temporal difference error. However,
this approach is prone to favoring noisy transitions, even when the value
estimation closely approximates the target mean. This phenomenon resembles the
noisy TV problem postulated in the exploration literature, in which
exploration-guided agents get stuck by mistaking noise for novelty. To mitigate
the disruptive effects of noise in value estimation, we propose using epistemic
uncertainty estimation to guide the prioritization of transitions from the
replay buffer. Epistemic uncertainty quantifies the uncertainty that can be
reduced by learning, hence reducing transitions sampled from the buffer
generated by unpredictable random processes. We first illustrate the benefits
of epistemic uncertainty prioritized replay in two tabular toy models: a simple
multi-arm bandit task, and a noisy gridworld. Subsequently, we evaluate our
prioritization scheme on the Atari suite, outperforming quantile regression
deep Q-learning benchmarks; thus forging a path for the use of uncertainty
prioritized replay in reinforcement learning agents.

*Samuel Holt,Max Ruiz Luyten,Antonin Berthon,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G-Sim is a hybrid framework combining LLM-driven structural design with empirical calibration to build reliable simulators for complex decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simulator methods struggle with generalization and accuracy, especially when using LLMs, limiting their utility in critical domains like healthcare and logistics.

Method: G-Sim uses an LLM in an iterative loop to design simulator components and causal relationships, then calibrates parameters using flexible, likelihood-free, and gradient-free techniques.

Result: G-Sim produces robust, causally-informed simulators that mitigate data inefficiency and support system-level interventions.

Conclusion: G-Sim effectively integrates domain knowledge with empirical evidence to create reliable simulators for complex scenarios.

Abstract: Constructing robust simulators is essential for asking "what if?" questions
and guiding policy in critical domains like healthcare and logistics. However,
existing methods often struggle, either failing to generalize beyond historical
data or, when using Large Language Models (LLMs), suffering from inaccuracies
and poor empirical alignment. We introduce G-Sim, a hybrid framework that
automates simulator construction by synergizing LLM-driven structural design
with rigorous empirical calibration. G-Sim employs an LLM in an iterative loop
to propose and refine a simulator's core components and causal relationships,
guided by domain knowledge. This structure is then grounded in reality by
estimating its parameters using flexible calibration techniques. Specifically,
G-Sim can leverage methods that are both likelihood-free and gradient-free with
respect to the simulator, such as gradient-free optimization for direct
parameter estimation or simulation-based inference for obtaining a posterior
distribution over parameters. This allows it to handle non-differentiable and
stochastic simulators. By integrating domain priors with empirical evidence,
G-Sim produces reliable, causally-informed simulators, mitigating
data-inefficiency and enabling robust system-level interventions for complex
decision-making.

*Lorenzo Steccanella,Joshua B. Evans,Özgür Şimşek,Anders Jonsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-supervised framework for learning state representations in MDPs using minimum action distance (MAD), requiring no rewards or actions. It outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To learn state representations without relying on reward signals or executed actions, capturing the environment's underlying structure for tasks like goal-conditioned RL.

Method: Proposes learning MAD as a metric, constructing an embedding space where distances correspond to MAD, accommodating symmetric/asymmetric approximations.

Result: Empirical results show the approach learns accurate MAD representations across diverse environments and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively learns state representations from trajectories alone, enhancing tasks like reward shaping and goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision
processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring
neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose
learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of
actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that
captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables
critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and
reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of
progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space
where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD,
accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the
framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values,
encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete
and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently
learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also
significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of
representation quality.

TL;DR: The study uses NLP and topic modeling on EHR notes to analyze HIV-related stigma, social, and behavioral factors in PLWHs, revealing key themes and demographic differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional questionnaires by leveraging EHR data for scalable, efficient assessment of HIV-related stigma and social factors.

Method: Applied LDA topic modeling to EHR notes from 9,140 PLWHs, using keyword filtering and expert review to identify stigma-related themes.

Result: Identified topics like "Mental Health Concern and Stigma" and "Social Support," with variations across age subgroups.

Conclusion: EHR-based NLP provides a scalable, efficient way to assess stigma and improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances in people living with HIV (PLWHs) seeking care, using natural
language processing methods applied to a large collection of electronic health
record (EHR) clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the
southeast United States. Methods: We identified 9,140 cohort of PLWHs from the
UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) to uncover stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral
circumstances. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma
keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to iteratively review notes for
additional terms until saturation was reached. To identify more target topics,
we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. Domain experts manually
reviewed the detected topics using the prevalent terms and key discussion
topics. Word frequency analysis was used to highlight the prevalent terms
associated with each topic. In addition, we conducted topic variation analysis
among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific
demographics. Results and Conclusion: Topic modeling on sentences containing at
least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes associated with
HIV-related stigma, social, and related behaviors circumstances, including
"Mental Health Concern and Stigma", "Social Support and Engagement", "Limited
Healthcare Access and Severe Illness", "Treatment Refusal and Isolation" and so
on. Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed differences.
Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma dimensions, social, and
related behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable,
time-efficient assessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional
questionnaires and improving patient outcomes.

*Mohammadsajad Abavisani,Kseniya Solovyeva,David Danks,Vince Calhoun,Sergey Plis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using answer set programming (ASP) to improve causal graph derivation from sub-sampled time series data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deriving causal graphs from time series data with mismatched measurement frequencies, which leads to information loss and ambiguous results.

Method: Uses constraint optimization via answer set programming (ASP) to identify optimal causal graphs and equivalence classes, leveraging graph theory for pruning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art precision and recall, 12% F1 score improvement over existing methods, and robustness to sub-sampling rates.

Conclusion: The ASP-based method provides accurate, intuitive causal graphs and can enhance existing approaches, demonstrating superior performance in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents
significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not
match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally
possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling
(i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our
research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling
in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive
outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set
programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies
the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of
possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to
leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding
a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional
approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical
structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established
methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a
meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12%
improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in
terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled
time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of
sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for
higher rates of sub-sampling.

*Yeonju Ro,Zhenyu Zhang,Souvik Kundu,Zhangyang Wang,Aditya Akella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces dual-state linear attention (DSLA) and an adaptive distillation framework (SERVE) to improve efficiency and accuracy in large language models, achieving faster inference while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the prohibitive compute and memory costs of self-attention in LLMs for lengthy inputs, and mitigate the short-range bias in sub-quadratic methods like linear attention.

Method: Propose DSLA with two hidden states for historical context and recency, and SERVE for adaptive distillation, replacing Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference.

Result: Achieves 2.3x faster inference than Llama2-7B and 3.0x faster than Zamba-7B, with comparable performance on tasks like commonsense reasoning and text summarization.

Conclusion: DSLA and SERVE effectively balance efficiency and accuracy, addressing limitations of prior linear attention methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at capturing global token dependencies via
self-attention but face prohibitive compute and memory costs on lengthy inputs.
While sub-quadratic methods (e.g., linear attention) can reduce these costs,
they often degrade accuracy due to overemphasizing recent tokens. In this work,
we first propose \textit{dual-state linear attention} (\textbf{\dsla}), a novel
design that maintains two specialized hidden states-one for preserving
historical context and one for tracking recency-thereby mitigating the
short-range bias typical of linear-attention architectures. To further balance
efficiency and accuracy under dynamic workload conditions, we introduce
\textbf{\serve}, an online \textit{adaptive distillation} framework that
progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA layers at inference time,
guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering. \serve\ uses a chained
fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly converted DSLA layer remains
consistent with previously replaced layers, preserving the overall quality.
Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning, long-context QA, and text
summarization demonstrate that \serve\ yields \textbf{2.3x} faster inference
than Llama2-7B and \textbf{3.0x} faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while
retaining comparable performance across downstream tasks. Our ablation studies
show that DSLA's dual states capture both global and local dependencies,
addressing the historical-token underrepresentation seen in prior linear
attentions. Codes are available at https://github.com/utnslab/DSLA-Serve.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InstructPro is a protein generative model that uses natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins, outperforming existing baselines in docking success and structural accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing proteins that bind to specific ligands is critical in biology and chemistry, but AI models are limited by scarce protein-ligand complex data. Human-curated text descriptions offer an alternative resource.

Method: InstructPro leverages textual descriptions and ligand formulas (SMILES) to generate protein sequences. It includes model variants (1B and 3B parameters) and a dataset, InstructProBench, for training and evaluation.

Result: InstructPro-1B achieves an 81.52% docking success rate and 4.026Å RMSD, while InstructPro-3B reduces RMSD to 2.527Å, outperforming ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal.

Conclusion: InstructPro demonstrates the ability to generate functionally consistent ligand-binding proteins from natural language instructions, offering a promising approach for protein design.

Abstract: Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins
with desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind
to a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and
chemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,
which is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory
experiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text
descriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this
paper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that
follow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a
textual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,
InstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with
the specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training
strategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training
and evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function
description, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:
InstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion
parameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including
ProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking
success rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean
square deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\AA}).
InstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\AA}, demonstrating
InstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the
functional specifications.

*Xuemei Cao,Hanlin Gu,Xin Yang,Bingjun Wei,Haoyang Liang,Xiangkun Wang,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ErrorEraser is a plugin for Continual Learning (CL) that addresses data biases by identifying and erasing erroneous memories, improving performance in old and new tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CL methods overlook data biases, leading to spurious correlations and reduced knowledge retention/transfer.

Method: ErrorEraser uses Error Identification (density distribution learning) and Error Erasure (decision space shifting) to remove biased samples.

Result: ErrorEraser enhances accuracy and reduces forgetting rates across CL methods.

Conclusion: Intentional forgetting of biased data improves CL, with ErrorEraser offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent
catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new
tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only
needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This
arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the
model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.
From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases
simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address
this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous
memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old
tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error
Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in
the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of
potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is
erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples.
Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed
to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream
tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly
mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and
lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods. The code is available
at https://github.com/diadai/ErrorEraser.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the convergence rate of adversarial classification risk for robust classifiers and provides surrogate risk bounds, including distribution-dependent bounds in non-adversarial settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the convergence rate of adversarial classification risk for robust classifiers trained via adversarial training.

Method: Derives surrogate risk bounds to quantify the convergence rate of adversarial classification risk and extends these to distribution-dependent bounds in standard learning.

Result: Provides surrogate risk bounds for adversarial consistency and distribution-dependent bounds in non-adversarial learning.

Conclusion: The paper advances understanding of adversarial training by quantifying convergence rates and offers insights applicable to both adversarial and standard learning settings.

Abstract: A central concern in classification is the vulnerability of machine learning
models to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most popular
techniques for training robust classifiers, which involves minimizing an
adversarial surrogate risk. Recent work characterized when a minimizing
sequence of an adversarial surrogate risk is also a minimizing sequence of the
adversarial classification risk for binary classification -- a property known
as adversarial consistency. However, these results do not address the rate at
which the adversarial classification risk converges to its optimal value for
such a sequence of functions that minimize the adversarial surrogate. This
paper provides surrogate risk bounds that quantify that convergence rate.
Additionally, we derive distribution-dependent surrogate risk bounds in the
standard (non-adversarial) learning setting, that may be of independent
interest.

TL;DR: A survey on anomaly detection and generation using diffusion models (ADGDM), highlighting their synergistic relationship, taxonomy, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but suffers from data scarcity. Diffusion models offer a robust framework for unsupervised AD by learning complex data distributions.

Method: Comprehensive review of ADGDM, including theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and a taxonomy based on scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectures.

Result: Reveals the synergistic relationship between anomaly detection and generation, where each improves the other, advancing both capabilities.

Conclusion: The survey guides researchers in leveraging diffusion models for AD, addressing challenges like scalability and suggesting future directions like integration with foundation models.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including
cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by
identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in
real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion
models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn
complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a
robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review
anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a
tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical
implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and
multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly
detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent
synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where
generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly
data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve
generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their
individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on
anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs,
analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges
including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising
future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and
integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large
language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research
questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in
leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

Conclusion: LPO significantly enhances GUI interaction precision and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical
User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful
intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods
in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face
substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive
positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often
fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their
utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a
novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction
preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by
focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic
location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying
importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference
Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI
environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results
across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will
be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

### [224] [Revisiting Diffusion Models: From Generative Pre-training to One-Step Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09376)
*Bowen Zheng,Tianming Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in diffusion distillation, proposes using a standalone GAN objective for efficient one-step generation, and suggests diffusion training as generative pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency and performance degradation in diffusion distillation by exploring alternative methods like GANs.

Method: Proposes using a standalone GAN objective to convert diffusion models into one-step generators and fine-tunes pre-trained models with frozen parameters.

Result: Achieves strong performance with minimal training data (0.2M images) and near-SOTA results with 5M images.

Conclusion: Diffusion training serves as effective generative pre-training, enabling efficient one-step generation models.

Abstract: Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost
of diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student
performance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN
objective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains
unclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation:
mismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student
model lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct
imitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective,
without relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is
sufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.
Based on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a
form of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be
unlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a
one-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of
parameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and
near-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain
analysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in
diffusion training. Overall, our work provides a new perspective for diffusion
training, highlighting its role as a powerful generative pre-training process,
which can be the basis for building efficient one-step generation models.

*Haiyang Yu,Yuchao Lin,Xuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Qian,Shuiwang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QHNetV2, a novel network, predicts Hamiltonian matrices efficiently by leveraging SO(2) equivariance, avoiding costly SO(3) operations, and shows strong performance on molecular datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accelerating electronic structure calculations in physics, chemistry, and materials science by predicting Hamiltonian matrices.

Method: Introduces SO(2)-equivariant operations and performs feature updates within SO(2) local frames, eliminating SO(3) tensor products. Uses continuous SO(2) tensor products for node feature fusion.

Result: Superior performance on QH9 and MD17 datasets, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: SO(2) operations on local frames provide a scalable, symmetry-aware approach for electronic structure learning. Code will be released in the AIRS library.

Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate
electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics,
chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship
between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local
frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves
global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor
products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful
SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates
and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of
SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed
within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the
symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and
MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a
wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong
generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames
offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of
electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library

*Shengda Gu,Kai Li,Junliang Xing,Yifan Zhang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAM combines DRL and GAs to enhance exploration and efficiency in solving combinatorial optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL lacks exploration and gets stuck in local optima, while GAs are sample inefficient. EAM aims to synergize their strengths.

Method: EAM generates solutions via DRL, refines them with GA operations, and reinjects them into training. Theoretical analysis ensures stability.

Result: EAM improves solution quality and training efficiency on benchmarks like TSP and CVRP.

Conclusion: EAM is a versatile, effective framework for combinatorial optimization, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are notoriously challenging due to their
discrete structure and exponentially large solution space. Recent advances in
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly
from data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and
susceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such
as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but
are typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work,
we propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and
plug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the
global search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned
policy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as
crossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected
into the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating
convergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an
upper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and
the policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL
solvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO. Extensive results on
benchmark problems (e.g., TSP, CVRP, PCTSP, and OP) demonstrate that EAM
significantly improves both solution quality and training efficiency over
competitive baselines.

*Shurui Gui,Shuiwang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPT mitigates spurious correlations in LLMs by decomposing predictions into unbiased steps, improving generalization without extra fine-tuning biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLMs' failure on OOD samples due to spurious correlations from pre-training.

Method: Causality-aware post-training (CAPT) decomposes predictions into event estimation and intervention, reducing biases.

Result: 3B-scale models with CAPT outperform SFT and larger LLMs on ID and OOD tasks using minimal samples.

Conclusion: CAPT is effective and sample-efficient for enhancing LLM generalization.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in language modeling, recent studies reveal that they often fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) samples due to spurious correlations acquired during
pre-training. Here, we aim to mitigate such spurious correlations through
causality-aware post-training (CAPT). By decomposing a biased prediction into
two unbiased steps, known as \textit{event estimation} and \textit{event
intervention}, we reduce LLMs' pre-training biases without incurring additional
fine-tuning biases, thus enhancing the model's generalization ability.
Experiments on the formal causal inference benchmark CLadder and the logical
reasoning dataset PrOntoQA show that 3B-scale language models fine-tuned with
CAPT can outperform both traditional SFT and larger LLMs on in-distribution
(ID) and OOD tasks using only 100 ID fine-tuning samples, demonstrating the
effectiveness and sample efficiency of CAPT.

### [228] [Generalization Error Analysis for Attack-Free and Byzantine-Resilient Decentralized Learning with Data Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09438)
*Haoxiang Ye,Tao Sun,Qing Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes generalization errors in decentralized learning, focusing on heterogeneous data and Byzantine attacks, revealing key factors like data heterogeneity and model initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding generalization errors in decentralized learning is crucial for real-world scalability, as prior studies overlooked data heterogeneity and relied on stringent assumptions.

Method: The study conducts fine-grained generalization error analysis for attack-free and Byzantine-resilient decentralized learning under mild assumptions, avoiding homogeneous data and strict gradient constraints.

Result: Findings highlight the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization, and stochastic gradient noise on generalization errors, and show Byzantine attacks' negative effects are tied to data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: Numerical experiments validate the theoretical insights, emphasizing the importance of addressing data heterogeneity and Byzantine resilience in decentralized learning.

Abstract: Decentralized learning, which facilitates joint model training across
geographically scattered agents, has gained significant attention in the field
of signal and information processing in recent years. While the optimization
errors of decentralized learning algorithms have been extensively studied,
their generalization errors remain relatively under-explored. As the
generalization errors reflect the scalability of trained models on unseen data
and are crucial in determining the performance of trained models in real-world
applications, understanding the generalization errors of decentralized learning
is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present fine-grained
generalization error analysis for both attack-free and Byzantine-resilient
decentralized learning with heterogeneous data as well as under mild
assumptions, in contrast to prior studies that consider homogeneous data and/or
rely on a stringent bounded stochastic gradient assumption. Our results shed
light on the impact of data heterogeneity, model initialization and stochastic
gradient noise -- factors that have not been closely investigated before -- on
the generalization error of decentralized learning. We also reveal that
Byzantine attacks performed by malicious agents largely affect the
generalization error, and their negative impact is inherently linked to the
data heterogeneity while remaining independent on the sample size. Numerical
experiments on both convex and non-convex tasks are conducted to validate our
theoretical findings.

### [229] [Safe Screening Rules for Group SLOPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09451)
*Runxue Bao,Quanchao Lu,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A safe screening rule for Group SLOPE improves computational efficiency by identifying inactive groups without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group SLOPE struggles with computational inefficiency due to block non-separable group effects in high-dimensional sparse learning.

Method: Introduces a safe screening rule to identify and exclude inactive groups during training, compatible with existing solvers.

Result: The rule safely detects inactive groups, reducing computational costs and memory usage while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed screening rule enhances Group SLOPE's efficiency without compromising performance, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Variable selection is a challenging problem in high-dimensional sparse
learning, especially when group structures exist. Group SLOPE performs well for
the adaptive selection of groups of predictors. However, the block
non-separable group effects in Group SLOPE make existing methods either invalid
or inefficient. Consequently, Group SLOPE tends to incur significant
computational costs and memory usage in practical high-dimensional scenarios.
To overcome this issue, we introduce a safe screening rule tailored for the
Group SLOPE model, which efficiently identifies inactive groups with zero
coefficients by addressing the block non-separable group effects. By excluding
these inactive groups during training, we achieve considerable gains in
computational efficiency and memory usage. Importantly, the proposed screening
rule can be seamlessly integrated into existing solvers for both batch and
stochastic algorithms. Theoretically, we establish that our screening rule can
be safely employed with existing optimization algorithms, ensuring the same
results as the original approaches. Experimental results confirm that our
method effectively detects inactive feature groups and significantly boosts
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.

*Jay Roberts,Kyle Mylonakis,Sidhartha Roy,Kaan Kale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Stained Glass Transform, a method to provide privacy for LLM inputs while preserving model utility, addressing concerns about plaintext data in shared or multi-tenant compute environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises face privacy concerns when using shared or multi-tenant AI infrastructure, as models operate on plaintext data, limiting sensitive data usage.

Method: The Stained Glass Transform is a learned, stochastic, sequence-dependent transformation of LLM word embeddings, theoretically linked to Gaussian Mixture Models' mutual information.

Result: The method provides information-theoretic privacy for LLM inputs while maintaining utility, validated through token-level privacy metrics and standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The Stained Glass Transform offers a practical solution for privacy-preserving LLM deployments without compromising performance.

Abstract: The high cost of ownership of AI compute infrastructure and challenges of
robust serving of large language models (LLMs) has led to a surge in managed
Model-as-a-service deployments. Even when enterprises choose on-premises
deployments, the compute infrastructure is typically shared across many teams
in order to maximize the return on investment. In both scenarios the deployed
models operate only on plaintext data, and so enterprise data owners must allow
their data to appear in plaintext on a shared or multi-tenant compute
infrastructure. This results in data owners with private or sensitive data
being hesitant or restricted in what data they use with these types of
deployments. In this work we introduce the Stained Glass Transform, a learned,
stochastic, and sequence dependent transformation of the word embeddings of an
LLM which information theoretically provides privacy to the input of the LLM
while preserving the utility of model. We theoretically connect a particular
class of Stained Glass Transforms to the theory of mutual information of
Gaussian Mixture Models. We then calculate a-postiori privacy estimates, based
on mutual information, and verify the privacy and utility of instances of
transformed embeddings through token level metrics of privacy and standard LLM
performance benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes RG² and RG× losses as efficient alternatives to Softmax Loss for ranking tasks, integrating ALS optimization for improved scalability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational overhead and scalability limitations of Softmax Loss in large-scale ranking tasks.

Method: Derives RG² and RG× losses via Taylor expansions of Softmax Loss and integrates them with ALS optimization.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior ranking performance to Softmax Loss with faster convergence.

Conclusion: Offers efficient tools and theoretical insights for similarity learning, balancing ranking quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Ranking tasks constitute fundamental components of extreme similarity
learning frameworks, where extremely large corpora of objects are modeled
through relative similarity relationships adhering to predefined ordinal
structures. Among various ranking surrogates, Softmax (SM) Loss has been widely
adopted due to its natural capability to handle listwise ranking via global
negative comparisons, along with its flexibility across diverse application
scenarios. However, despite its effectiveness, SM Loss often suffers from
significant computational overhead and scalability limitations when applied to
large-scale object spaces. To address this challenge, we propose novel loss
formulations that align directly with ranking metrics: the
Ranking-Generalizable \textbf{squared} (RG$^2$) Loss and the
Ranking-Generalizable interactive (RG$^\times$) Loss, both derived through
Taylor expansions of the SM Loss. Notably, RG$^2$ reveals the intrinsic
mechanisms underlying weighted squared losses (WSL) in ranking methods and
uncovers fundamental connections between sampling-based and non-sampling-based
loss paradigms. Furthermore, we integrate the proposed RG losses with the
highly efficient Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method, providing
both generalization guarantees and convergence rate analyses. Empirical
evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable or superior ranking performance relative to SM Loss, while
significantly accelerating convergence. This framework offers the similarity
learning community both theoretical insights and practically efficient tools,
with methodologies applicable to a broad range of tasks where balancing ranking
quality and computational efficiency is essential.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies pitfalls in KL divergence gradient estimation for RL in LLMs, showing incorrect implementations and partial gradients, and provides correct methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address common errors in KL divergence gradient estimation in RL for LLMs, as seen in open-source projects and papers.

Method: Analyzes incorrect implementations, demonstrates issues with tabular and LLM experiments, and presents correct gradient estimation methods.

Result: Reveals flaws in current practices and validates the correct approach through experiments.

Conclusion: Corrects KL gradient estimation is crucial for accurate RL training in LLMs, and the paper provides the right implementation.

Abstract: We point out a few pitfalls in implementing gradient estimation for KL
divergence in RL training for LLM, as seen in a number of open source projects
and papers. The first major pitfall is to differentiate through the KL estimate
as loss functions to minimize KL divergence. We show that such implementations
are generally incorrect and do not produce the desired KL gradient. Secondly,
we show that some implementations do not account for the sequential nature of
the estimation problem and produce a partial gradient at best. We demonstrate
the impact of such issues with illustrative tabular and LLM experiments, and
show the correct way to implement the KL gradient.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EnerBridge-DPO is a novel framework for generating low-energy, stable protein sequences by integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and an energy constraint loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods in protein inverse folding prioritize sequence recovery over energy stability, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Combines Markov Bridges and DPO, using energy-based preferences and an explicit energy constraint loss to optimize sequences.

Result: Generates lower-energy sequences with comparable recovery rates and accurately predicts ΔΔG values.

Conclusion: EnerBridge-DPO advances protein inverse folding by balancing energy stability and sequence recovery.

Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key
challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are
primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the
energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation
by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein
sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused
on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation
lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge
model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior
sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence
candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which
enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the
model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior
knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing
quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that
EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while
maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and
accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OKBEs introduce state-time option kernels (STOKs) for reward-free MDPs, optimizing goal completion while avoiding constraints. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable, enabling long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflict between reward-maximization and properties like compositionality, modularity, and interpretability in reinforcement learning.

Method: Construct and optimize STOKs using Chapman-Kolmogorov equations for spatiotemporal predictions, factorized representations, and formal verification.

Result: Flexible agents capable of rapid meta-policy synthesis, reusable planning representations, and goal justification via empowerment.

Conclusion: OKBEs support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation, scaling to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free
Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct
and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to
maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint
violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable
initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options
Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple
policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and
computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs
record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and
constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a
high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we
can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are
aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at
the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties
lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse
planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using
empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that
reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality,
modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these
properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation
that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

TL;DR: A meta-algorithm for reinforcement learning from human feedback using randomized exploration and batch querying to improve efficiency and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning from trajectory-level preference comparisons efficiently while ensuring theoretical guarantees.

Method: Proposes a meta-algorithm with randomized exploration and an improved batch-based algorithm for optimal query selection.

Result: Achieves regret and last-iterate guarantees, with empirical results showing competitiveness with reward-based RL using fewer queries.

Conclusion: The method efficiently learns from human feedback with theoretical and practical benefits.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov
decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference
comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that
select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while
ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on
randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated
with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and
last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions.
To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm
that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental
design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also
enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical
deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation
confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based
reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel neural network architecture to improve generalization and extrapolation for periodic signals, addressing overfitting in coordinate-based MLPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinate-based MLPs struggle with overfitting and poor extrapolation, especially for periodic signals. This work aims to enhance performance for such signals.

Method: A new network architecture extracts periodic patterns from data to improve signal representation, tested on differential equations and real-world time series.

Result: The proposed method shows improved generalization and extrapolation, validated through experiments on periodic solutions and time series tasks.

Conclusion: The architecture effectively leverages periodicity to enhance MLP performance, offering better generalization and extrapolation for periodic signals.

Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective
tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its
corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural
representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in
learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of
overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting
in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the
underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or
temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic
patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the
signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation
performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through
comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for
differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and
forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Athena-PRM is a multimodal process reward model for evaluating reasoning steps, using weak-strong completer consistency for high-quality labels. It achieves strong performance with minimal data and introduces ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performance PRMs require costly step-level annotations, and conventional labeling methods are noisy and expensive.

Method: Uses prediction consistency between weak and strong completers for reliable labels, with ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data.

Result: Achieves superior performance with 5,000 samples, improving benchmarks by up to 10.2 points and setting SoTA in VisualProcessBench.

Conclusion: Athena-PRM efficiently generates high-quality process labels and enhances reasoning evaluation, validated across multiple scenarios.

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to
evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems.
Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and
financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations
of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte
Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial
computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data,
we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers
as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM
demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks
with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies
to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for
negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios:
verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step
correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently
achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios.
Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances
performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time
scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in
VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,
showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the
reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we
develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with
a significant margin on five benchmarks.

TL;DR: STOAT is a novel framework for probabilistic forecasting in spatial-temporal causal time series, combining causal inference with spatial dependencies and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods model spatial and temporal dynamics independently and ignore causality-driven probabilistic forecasting, limiting predictive power.

Method: STOAT incorporates a spatial relation matrix for interregional dependencies and uses deep probabilistic models to estimate distribution parameters, supporting multiple output distributions.

Result: STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art models (e.g., DeepAR, DeepVAR) in COVID-19 data experiments, especially in regions with strong spatial dependencies.

Conclusion: STOAT bridges causal inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, offering a generalizable framework for tasks like epidemic management.

Abstract: Spatial-temporal causal time series (STC-TS) involve region-specific temporal
observations driven by causally relevant covariates and interconnected across
geographic or network-based spaces. Existing methods often model spatial and
temporal dynamics independently and overlook causality-driven probabilistic
forecasting, limiting their predictive power. To address this, we propose STOAT
(Spatial-Temporal Probabilistic Causal Inference Network), a novel framework
for probabilistic forecasting in STC-TS. The proposed method extends a causal
inference approach by incorporating a spatial relation matrix that encodes
interregional dependencies (e.g. proximity or connectivity), enabling spatially
informed causal effect estimation. The resulting latent series are processed by
deep probabilistic models to estimate the parameters of the distributions,
enabling calibrated uncertainty modeling. We further explore multiple output
distributions (e.g., Gaussian, Student's-$t$, Laplace) to capture
region-specific variability. Experiments on COVID-19 data across six countries
demonstrate that STOAT outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting
models (DeepAR, DeepVAR, Deep State Space Model, etc.) in key metrics,
particularly in regions with strong spatial dependencies. By bridging causal
inference and geospatial probabilistic forecasting, STOAT offers a
generalizable framework for complex spatial-temporal tasks, such as epidemic
management.

Abstract: Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL,
which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected
datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is
constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit
policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework
that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While
previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added
computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces
a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories.
This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while
utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by
effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added
complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL
benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational
overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for
practical applications in real-world scenarios.

### [240] [Beyond Overconfidence: Foundation Models Redefine Calibration in Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09593)
*Achim Hekler,Lukas Kuhn,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models like ConvNeXt, EVA, and BEiT show underconfidence in in-distribution predictions but better calibration under shifts. Post-hoc calibration works well in-distribution but fails under severe shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the calibration behavior of foundation models, which is underexplored despite their predictive performance.

Method: Empirical analysis of foundation models' calibration, including in-distribution and shifted settings, and testing post-hoc calibration techniques.

Result: Foundation models are underconfident in-distribution but better calibrated under shifts. Post-hoc calibration is effective in-distribution but unreliable under severe shifts.

Conclusion: Calibration effects of foundation models are complex and non-monotonic, challenging the idea of continuous improvement in model calibration.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty calibration is essential for safely deploying deep
neural networks in high-stakes applications. Deep neural networks are known to
exhibit systematic overconfidence, especially under distribution shifts.
Although foundation models such as ConvNeXt, EVA and BEiT have demonstrated
significant improvements in predictive performance, their calibration
properties remain underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive
investigation into the calibration behavior of foundation models, revealing
insights that challenge established paradigms. Our empirical analysis shows
that these models tend to be underconfident in in-distribution predictions,
resulting in higher calibration errors, while demonstrating improved
calibration under distribution shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
foundation models are highly responsive to post-hoc calibration techniques in
the in-distribution setting, enabling practitioners to effectively mitigate
underconfidence bias. However, these methods become progressively less reliable
under severe distribution shifts and can occasionally produce counterproductive
results. Our findings highlight the complex, non-monotonic effects of
architectural and training innovations on calibration, challenging established
narratives of continuous improvement.

*Wenjin Qin,Hailin Wang,Jingyao Hou,Jianjun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces fast randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) and a nonconvex modeling framework for large-scale tensor recovery, addressing computational challenges and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor recovery methods struggle with scale variations and high computational costs for large-scale data, prompting the need for efficient solutions.

Method: The authors use Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization, and random projection to devise randomized LRTA algorithms. They also develop a nonconvex framework with new regularization for tensor recovery.

Result: Theoretical bounds for approximation error are established, and experiments show the method's superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithms and framework are practical, effective, and efficient for large-scale tensor recovery tasks.

Abstract: Currently, existing tensor recovery methods fail to recognize the impact of
tensor scale variations on their structural characteristics. Furthermore,
existing studies face prohibitive computational costs when dealing with
large-scale high-order tensor data. To alleviate these issue, assisted by the
Krylov subspace iteration, block Lanczos bidiagonalization process, and random
projection strategies, this article first devises two fast and accurate
randomized algorithms for low-rank tensor approximation (LRTA) problem.
Theoretical bounds on the accuracy of the approximation error estimate are
established. Next, we develop a novel generalized nonconvex modeling framework
tailored to large-scale tensor recovery, in which a new regularization paradigm
is exploited to achieve insightful prior representation for large-scale
tensors. On the basis of the above, we further investigate new unified
nonconvex models and efficient optimization algorithms, respectively, for
several typical high-order tensor recovery tasks in unquantized and quantized
situations. To render the proposed algorithms practical and efficient for
large-scale tensor data, the proposed randomized LRTA schemes are integrated
into their central and time-intensive computations. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various large-scale tensors, whose results demonstrate
the practicability, effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in
comparison with some state-of-the-art approaches.

*Kaiwen Tuo,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseSSM is a training-free pruning framework for state-space models like Mamba, achieving 50% weight reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods fail for state-space models due to their unique architecture.

Method: Extends optimal brain surgeon (OBS) with layer-wise Hessian-trace aggregation, sensitivity analysis, and support for structured sparsity.

Result: Prunes 50% of SSM weights without fine-tuning, maintaining zero-shot accuracy.

Conclusion: SparseSSM is state-of-the-art for pruning Mamba-based LLMs.

Abstract: State-space language models such as Mamba match Transformer quality while
permitting linear complexity inference, yet still comprise billions of
parameters that hinder deployment. Existing one-shot pruning methods are
tailored to attention blocks and fail to account for the time-shared and
discretized state-transition matrix at the heart of the selective state-space
module (SSM). In this paper, we introduce SparseSSM, the first training-free
pruning framework that extends the classic optimal brain surgeon (OBS)
framework to state space architectures. Our layer-wise algorithm (i) derives an
approximate second-order saliency score that aggregates Hessian-trace
information across time steps, (ii) incorporates a component sensitivity
analysis to guide feed-forward network (FFN) pruning, which also sheds light on
where redundancy resides in mamba architecture, (iii) can be easily extended to
semi-structured and structured sparsity. Empirically, we prune 50% of SSM
weights without fine-tuning and observe no zero-shot accuracy loss, achieving
the current state-of-the-art pruning algorithm for Mamba-based LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLGENN, a new equivariant neural network architecture using geometric algebras, outperforms competitors with fewer parameters and less overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a parameter-efficient and robust equivariant neural network architecture that handles all pseudo-orthogonal transformations.

Method: Uses geometric (Clifford) algebras and a weight-sharing technique to ensure equivariance and reduce parameters.

Result: GLGENN matches or outperforms baselines on equivariant tasks with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: GLGENN is a scalable, efficient solution for equivariant tasks, reducing overfitting and computational costs.

Abstract: We propose, implement, and compare with competitors a new architecture of
equivariant neural networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebras: Generalized
Lipschitz Group Equivariant Neural Networks (GLGENN). These networks are
equivariant to all pseudo-orthogonal transformations, including rotations and
reflections, of a vector space with any non-degenerate or degenerate symmetric
bilinear form. We propose a weight-sharing parametrization technique that takes
into account the fundamental structures and operations of geometric algebras.
Due to this technique, GLGENN architecture is parameter-light and has less
tendency to overfitting than baseline equivariant models. GLGENN outperforms or
matches competitors on several benchmarking equivariant tasks, including
estimation of an equivariant function and a convex hull experiment, while using
significantly fewer optimizable parameters.

*Pol G. Recasens,Alberto Gutierrez,Jordi Torres,Josep. Ll Berral,Anisa Halimi,Kieran Fraser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs are used for synthetic tabular data generation, but biases in in-context examples can distort synthetic data and compromise fairness in downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how biases in in-context examples affect synthetic data generation and downstream fairness, especially in sensitive domains.

Method: Systematic analysis of bias propagation in LLM-based synthetic data generation, including an adversarial scenario with injected bias.

Result: Mild in-context biases cause global statistical distortions, and malicious bias injection can compromise fairness for protected subgroups.

Conclusion: LLM-based data generation pipelines are vulnerable to bias propagation, highlighting risks in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for synthetic tabular data
generation through in-context learning (ICL), offering a practical solution for
data augmentation in data scarce scenarios. While prior work has shown the
potential of LLMs to improve downstream task performance through augmenting
underrepresented groups, these benefits often assume access to a subset of
unbiased in-context examples, representative of the real dataset. In real-world
settings, however, data is frequently noisy and demographically skewed. In this
paper, we systematically study how statistical biases within in-context
examples propagate to the distribution of synthetic tabular data, showing that
even mild in-context biases lead to global statistical distortions. We further
introduce an adversarial scenario where a malicious contributor can inject bias
into the synthetic dataset via a subset of in-context examples, ultimately
compromising the fairness of downstream classifiers for a targeted and
protected subgroup. Our findings demonstrate a new vulnerability associated
with LLM-based data generation pipelines that rely on in-context prompts with
in sensitive domains.

*Weiying Zheng,Ziyue Lin,Pengxin Guo,Yuyin Zhou,Feifei Wang,Liangqiong Qu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedVLMBench is the first systematic benchmark for federated fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), evaluating architectures, strategies, and algorithms across diverse datasets and tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in VLM deployment by introducing federated learning (FL) and filling the gap in comprehensive benchmarks for federated fine-tuning.

Method: Integrates two VLM architectures, four fine-tuning strategies, five FL algorithms, and six datasets across single-task and multitask settings.

Result: Optimal configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL is a 2-layer MLP connector with concurrent tuning. FL methods are more sensitive to data heterogeneity in vision-centric tasks.

Conclusion: FedVLMBench provides tools, datasets, and insights to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of multimodal models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual
information. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing
approaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in
domains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have
introduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these
privacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated
fine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain
lacking. In this work, we present \textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic
benchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two
mainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning
strategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four
cross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,
covering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive
experiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task
federated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron
(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal
configuration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods
exhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in
vision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and
encoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,
datasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a
standardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of
multimodal foundation models.

### [246] [SyncFed: Time-Aware Federated Learning through Explicit Timestamping and Synchronization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09660)
*Baran Can Gül,Stefanos Tziampazis,Nasser Jazdi,Michael Weyrich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SyncFed introduces a time-aware FL framework to address network delays and unsynchronicity, improving model reliability and convergence by quantifying staleness using timestamps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in FL like network delays and unsynchronicity undermine model reliability; existing methods lack precise staleness quantification.

Method: SyncFed uses explicit synchronization and timestamping under NTP to quantify staleness and apply temporally informed weighting during aggregation.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows SyncFed improves model accuracy and information freshness compared to round-based baselines.

Conclusion: SyncFed effectively addresses temporal inconsistencies in FL, enhancing model performance in distributed environments.

Abstract: As Federated Learning (FL) expands to larger and more distributed
environments, consistency in training is challenged by network-induced delays,
clock unsynchronicity, and variability in client updates. This combination of
factors may contribute to misaligned contributions that undermine model
reliability and convergence. Existing methods like staleness-aware aggregation
and model versioning address lagging updates heuristically, yet lack mechanisms
to quantify staleness, especially in latency-sensitive and cross-regional
deployments. In light of these considerations, we introduce \emph{SyncFed}, a
time-aware FL framework that employs explicit synchronization and timestamping
to establish a common temporal reference across the system. Staleness is
quantified numerically based on exchanged timestamps under the Network Time
Protocol (NTP), enabling the server to reason about the relative freshness of
client updates and apply temporally informed weighting during aggregation. Our
empirical evaluation on a geographically distributed testbed shows that, under
\emph{SyncFed}, the global model evolves within a stable temporal context,
resulting in improved accuracy and information freshness compared to
round-based baselines devoid of temporal semantics.

*Alessandro Licciardi,Davide Leo,Davide Carbone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WAFFLE detects anomalous clients in Federated Learning using compressed Wavelet or Fourier representations, improving accuracy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting corrupted clients in FL without accessing raw data is challenging and crucial for model performance.

Method: Uses Wavelet Scattering Transform or Fourier Transform for task-agnostic embeddings, with a lightweight detector trained on public data.

Result: Improves detection accuracy and downstream classification compared to existing FL anomaly detection methods.

Conclusion: WAFFLE is effective as a pre-training alternative to online detection, with WST offering theoretical advantages.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables the training of machine learning models
across decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, the
presence of anomalous or corrupted clients - such as those with faulty sensors
or non representative data distributions - can significantly degrade model
performance. Detecting such clients without accessing raw data remains a key
challenge. We propose WAFFLE (Wavelet and Fourier representations for Federated
Learning) a detection algorithm that labels malicious clients {\it before
training}, using locally computed compressed representations derived from
either the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) or the Fourier Transform. Both
approaches provide low-dimensional, task-agnostic embeddings suitable for
unsupervised client separation. A lightweight detector, trained on a
distillated public dataset, performs the labeling with minimal communication
and computational overhead. While both transforms enable effective detection,
WST offers theoretical advantages, such as non-invertibility and stability to
local deformations, that make it particularly well-suited to federated
scenarios. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method improves
detection accuracy and downstream classification performance compared to
existing FL anomaly detection algorithms, validating its effectiveness as a
pre-training alternative to online detection strategies.

### [248] [Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09682)
*Iulia Duta,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network (WHGNN), a model using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling to capture higher-order relational data, outperforming traditional methods in node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hypergraph neural networks simplify aggregations to basic pooling, missing geometric properties of distributions. The paper aims to preserve these properties for better relational modeling.

Method: WHGNN treats nodes and hyperedges as distributions, aggregating information via Sliced Wasserstein Pooling to capture shape and spread, unlike mean or sum pooling.

Result: WHGNN achieves top performance in node classification tasks on real-world datasets, demonstrating the benefits of Wasserstein pooling.

Conclusion: The proposed WHGNN effectively models higher-order relationships by preserving distributional properties, advancing hypergraph representation learning.

Abstract: The ability to model relational information using machine learning has driven
advancements across various domains, from medicine to social science. While
graph representation learning has become mainstream over the past decade,
representing higher-order relationships through hypergraphs is rapidly gaining
momentum. In the last few years, numerous hypergraph neural networks have
emerged, most of them falling under a two-stage, set-based framework. The
messages are sent from nodes to edges and then from edges to nodes. However,
most of the advancement still takes inspiration from the graph counterpart,
often simplifying the aggregations to basic pooling operations. In this paper
we are introducing Wasserstein Hypergraph Neural Network, a model that treats
the nodes and hyperedge neighbourhood as distributions and aggregate the
information using Sliced Wasserstein Pooling. Unlike conventional aggregators
such as mean or sum, which only capture first-order statistics, our approach
has the ability to preserve geometric properties like the shape and spread of
distributions. This enables the learned embeddings to reflect how easily one
hyperedge distribution can be transformed into another, following principles of
optimal transport. Experimental results demonstrate that applying Wasserstein
pooling in a hypergraph setting significantly benefits node classification
tasks, achieving top performance on several real-world datasets.

*Vincenzo Collura,Karim Tit,Laura Bussi,Eleonora Giunchiglia,Maxime Cordy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIDENT is a model-agnostic algorithm ensuring LLM outputs comply with temporal constraints (LTLf) via DFA-guided beam search, improving both constraint satisfaction and output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack inherent capability to enforce temporal constraints like LTLf, necessitating a method to guarantee compliance without retraining.

Method: TRIDENT compiles LTLf formulas into a DFA, masks violating transitions during beam search, and dynamically re-ranks paths.

Result: Perfect constraint satisfaction and improved output quality in tasks like image-stream classification and controlled text generation.

Conclusion: TRIDENT effectively enforces temporal constraints while enhancing efficiency and output quality, validated across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved
impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks.
However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs
satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal
Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general
and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with
such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf
formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a
constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that
would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are
dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's
acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are
guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically
demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach
on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and
controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect
constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows
improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

*Vaggelis Dorovatas,Georgios Paraskevopoulos,Alexandros Potamianos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs) replace short residual connections with long feedforward ones, enabling auto-compression for efficient, robust learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational redundancy in deep networks without sacrificing representation quality.

Method: Introduce ACNs with long feedforward connections to dynamically compress information during training.

Result: ACNs reduce catastrophic forgetting, enable architectural compression, and improve noise robustness and transfer learning.

Conclusion: ACNs offer a practical, efficient approach to adaptive neural architectures with robust representations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated
remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces
computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation
quality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an
architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each
layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs
showcase a unique property we coin as "auto-compression", the ability of a
network to organically compress information during training with gradient
descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression,
information is dynamically "pushed" into early layers during training,
enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in
deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise
training patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during
training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced
noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in
low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate
catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that
generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to
18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression
while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT
architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional
pruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance
trade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish
ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that
automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while
learning robust representations.

*Minjong Cheon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network, achieves stable long-range weather forecasts on standard grids without spherical remapping, challenging the need for non-standard data representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if stable long-range weather forecasts can be achieved on standard latitude-longitude grids, challenging the assumption that non-standard spatial domains are necessary.

Method: Introduces AtmosMJ with a Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism to prevent error accumulation in long recursive simulations, operating directly on ERA5 data.

Result: AtmosMJ produces stable forecasts for ~500 days, matches 10-day forecast accuracy of leading models, and requires only 5.7 days of V100 GPU training.

Conclusion: Efficient architectural design, not non-standard data representation, is key to stable, computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in
data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional
numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range
autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.
Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as
SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard
spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the
prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce
physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that
assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be
achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep
convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical
remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion
(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error
accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that
AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.
In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy
against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a
remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest
that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data
representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally
efficient long-range weather prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal graph learning methods lack generalization across diverse data and tasks, prompting the need for a unified approach.

Method: The paper introduces a framework for multi-modal graph data, tasks, and models, emphasizing multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics.

Result: Five key characteristics for MG-LLM are identified, along with challenges and future research directions.

Conclusion: The paper aims to advance research on MG-LLM for generalization in multi-modal graph applications.

Abstract: Multi-modal graphs, which integrate diverse multi-modal features and
relations, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, existing
multi-modal graph learning methods are typically trained from scratch for
specific graph data and tasks, failing to generalize across various multi-modal
graph data and tasks. To bridge this gap, we explore the potential of
Multi-modal Graph Large Language Models (MG-LLM) to unify and generalize across
diverse multi-modal graph data and tasks. We propose a unified framework of
multi-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent
multi-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs.
Specifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1)
unified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of
handling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context
learning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5)
multi-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review
related works, and highlight promising future research directions towards
realizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing
multi-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper
can contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for
generalization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cognitive architecture for ML monitoring enhances interpretability by applying feature engineering principles to LLMs, improving decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML monitoring outputs are verbose and lack interpretability, hindering effective decision-making.

Method: Proposes a Decision Procedure module with three steps: Refactor (improves data representation), Break Down (decomposes complex information), and Compile (integrates insights).

Result: Achieves higher accuracy compared to baselines across domains.

Conclusion: The approach provides highly interpretable and actionable insights, reducing reliance on inconsistent LLM-generated planning.

Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is
crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability
outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive
architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to
agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the
interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision
Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps:
Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data
representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus
on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant
information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis,
and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This
process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on
LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general.
The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM
utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing
highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher
accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of minimizing total training time in decentralized federated learning while balancing computational and communication loads.

Method: Formulates the scheduling problem as a global optimization task, decomposes it into node-wise subproblems, and introduces a variance constraint for balanced data utilization under non-IID distributions.

Result: Simulations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show significant reductions in training time and faster convergence compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Load-aware Tram-FL effectively optimizes training efficiency in decentralized federated learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that
introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in
decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and
communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global
optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made
solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data
utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced,
while the overall training latency, including both computation and
communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation
results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly
reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: Prior works lack a comprehensive framework to explain various contrastive loss objectives. The paper aims to unify understanding of CL by analyzing cosine similarity and addressing its limitations.

Method: The framework analyzes cosine similarity in CL, identifies issues in full-batch (misalignment) and mini-batch (high variance) settings, and introduces an auxiliary loss to reduce variance in mini-batch CL.

Result: The proposed auxiliary loss improves CL performance in small-batch training by reducing variance in negative pair similarities.

Conclusion: The unified framework and auxiliary loss enhance CL by addressing misalignment and variance issues, leading to better performance in small-batch settings.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) operates on a simple yet effective principle:
embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs
are pushed apart. Although various forms of contrastive loss have been proposed
and analyzed from different perspectives, prior works lack a comprehensive
framework that systematically explains a broad class of these objectives. In
this paper, we present a unified framework for understanding CL, which is based
on analyzing the cosine similarity between embeddings of positive and negative
pairs. In full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs
is unattainable when similarities of negative pairs fall below a certain
threshold, and that this misalignment can be alleviated by incorporating
within-view negative pairs. In mini-batch settings, we demonstrate that smaller
batch sizes incur stronger separation among negative pairs within batches,
which leads to higher variance in similarities of negative pairs. To address
this limitation of mini-batch CL, we introduce an auxiliary loss term that
reduces the variance of similarities of negative pairs in CL. Empirical results
demonstrate that incorporating the proposed loss consistently improves the
performance of CL methods in small-batch training.

### [256] [A theoretical framework for self-supervised contrastive learning for continuous dependent data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09785)
*Alexander Marusov,Alexander Yuhay,Alexey Zaytsev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel contrastive SSL framework for dependent data, proposing hard and soft closeness measures and dependency-aware loss functions, outperforming existing methods on temporal and spatio-temporal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional contrastive SSL assumes semantic independence between samples, which fails for dependent data with complex correlations. This work addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes a theoretical framework for contrastive SSL on continuous dependent data, introducing hard and soft closeness measures and deriving dependency-aware loss functions.

Result: Outperforms TS2Vec on UEA and UCR benchmarks (4.17% and 2.08% accuracy improvements) and achieves 7% higher ROC-AUC on drought classification.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively captures spatio-temporal dependencies, demonstrating superior performance on dependent data tasks.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning
representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its
application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains,
remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often
assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for
dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical
framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data},
which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In
particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures}
between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive
an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that
accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing
dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent
TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the
dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones
for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically
grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies.
Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with
accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on
the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal
patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

### [257] [Devil's Hand: Data Poisoning Attacks to Locally Private Graph Learning Protocols](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09803)
*Longzhu He,Chaozhuo Li,Peng Tang,Litian Zhang,Sen Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a data poisoning attack on locally private graph learning protocols, demonstrating its effectiveness and exploring limited defense strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns in GNNs due to sensitive data in graphs and the overlooked threat of data poisoning in locally private protocols.

Method: Proposes a data poisoning attack by injecting fake users, manipulating links, and sending crafted data to compromise learning utility.

Result: The attack is proven effective theoretically and empirically, with existing defenses showing limited success.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust defenses to secure privacy-preserving graph learning frameworks.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in graph
representation learning and have been applied to various domains. However, many
real-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles
in social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is
performed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning
protocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the
privacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of
GNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy
guarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node
classification accuracy) for graph learning. Despite these advantages, such
protocols may be vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, a threat that has not
been considered in previous research. Identifying and addressing these threats
is crucial for ensuring the robustness and security of privacy-preserving graph
learning frameworks. This work introduces the first data poisoning attack
targeting locally private graph learning protocols. The attacker injects fake
users into the protocol, manipulates these fake users to establish links with
genuine users, and sends carefully crafted data to the server, ultimately
compromising the utility of private graph learning. The effectiveness of the
attack is demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. In addition, several
defense strategies have also been explored, but their limited effectiveness
highlights the need for more robust defenses.

*Minoh Jeong,Alfred Hero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProjNCE, a generalization of InfoNCE, unifies supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning, offering improved performance and flexibility in class embedding projections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The relationship between supervised contrastive learning (SupCon) and mutual information (MI) remains unexplored, unlike self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL). This gap is addressed by introducing ProjNCE.

Method: ProjNCE extends InfoNCE with projection functions and an adjustment term for negative pairs, forming a valid MI bound. It explores centroid-based class embeddings and various projection methods.

Result: ProjNCE consistently outperforms SupCon and cross-entropy training across multiple datasets and settings.

Conclusion: ProjNCE refines SupCon by providing MI interpretation and flexible projection design, offering broad improvements for contrastive learning objectives.

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for representation learning and has been studied from multiple
perspectives, including mutual information and geometric viewpoints. However,
supervised contrastive (SupCon) approaches have received comparatively little
attention in this context: for instance, while InfoNCE used in SSCL is known to
form a lower bound on mutual information (MI), the relationship between SupCon
and MI remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce ProjNCE, a
generalization of the InfoNCE loss that unifies supervised and self-supervised
contrastive objectives by incorporating projection functions and an adjustment
term for negative pairs. We prove that ProjNCE constitutes a valid MI bound and
affords greater flexibility in selecting projection strategies for class
embeddings. Building on this flexibility, we further explore the centroid-based
class embeddings in SupCon by exploring a variety of projection methods.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings demonstrate that
ProjNCE consistently outperforms both SupCon and standard cross-entropy
training. Our work thus refines SupCon along two complementary
perspective--mutual information interpretation and projection design--and
offers broadly applicable improvements whenever SupCon serves as the
foundational contrastive objective.

*Ariel Procaccia,Benjamin Schiffer,Serena Wang,Shirley Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes two notions of representation for selecting subsets of evaluation metrics using social choice theory, proving bounds on required metrics and applying the framework to real-world cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the ambiguity in defining 'representative' subsets of metrics for LLM evaluation, aiming for clarity and fairness in selection.

Method: Introduces positional representation and positional proportionality, proving theoretical bounds and generalizing properties for grouped metrics.

Result: Establishes worst-case bounds on metrics needed for representation and demonstrates applicability in LLM and hospital quality evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled approach to metric subset selection, balancing efficiency and fairness, with practical validation.

Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from
a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for
efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a
``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely
clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to
formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of
evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which
guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position
cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no
alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small
error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number
of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We
also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input
on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to
practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital
quality evaluation.

*Cecilia Casolo,Sören Becker,Niki Kilbertus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores identifiability of sparse linear ODEs, showing they are unidentifiable with positive probability in practical sparsity regimes, unlike dense systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored sparse regime in dynamical systems modeling, which is practically relevant in biological, social, and physical systems.

Method: Characterizes identifiability of sparse linear ODEs, provides lower bounds for unidentifiability probability, and empirically tests state-of-the-art estimation methods.

Result: Sparse systems are theoretically and practically unidentifiable, with unresolved limitations despite inductive biases or optimization.

Conclusion: Calls for rethinking expectations in data-driven dynamical system modeling and enables quantitative trust assessment of learned linear ODEs.

Abstract: Dynamical systems modeling is a core pillar of scientific inquiry across
natural and life sciences. Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned
from data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are
not identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior
under new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer
the system. It is known in the community that "linear ordinary differential
equations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory."
However, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains
underexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally
in many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this
gap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to
the dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive
probability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds
for this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical
unidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs
from data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically
unidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive
biases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be
expected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative
assessments of how much to trust a learned linear ODE.

*Johan Erbani,Sonia Ben Mokhtar,Pierre-Edouard Portier,Elod Egyed-Zsigmond,Diana Nurbakova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces WoLA, a weighted loss method for Byzantine-resilient federated learning, improving gradient alignment in heterogeneous settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL faces security threats from Byzantine participants who submit harmful gradients. Existing methods struggle in heterogeneous settings where honest gradients vary widely.

Method: Proposes Worker Label Alignment Loss (WoLA) to align honest gradients, aiding Byzantine gradient identification.

Result: WoLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in heterogeneous settings, supported by theory and experiments.

Conclusion: WoLA effectively enhances Byzantine resilience in FL, especially in heterogeneous environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables multiple
data holders to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing
their training data with external parties. In this paradigm, workers locally
update a model and share with a central server their updated gradients (or
model parameters). While FL seems appealing from a privacy perspective, it
opens a number of threats from a security perspective as (Byzantine)
participants can contribute poisonous gradients (or model parameters) harming
model convergence. Byzantine-resilient FL addresses this issue by ensuring that
the training proceeds as if Byzantine participants were absent. Towards this
purpose, common strategies ignore outlier gradients during model aggregation,
assuming that Byzantine gradients deviate more from honest gradients than
honest gradients do from each other. However, in heterogeneous settings, honest
gradients may differ significantly, making it difficult to distinguish honest
outliers from Byzantine ones. In this paper, we introduce the Worker Label
Alignement Loss (WoLA), a weighted loss that aligns honest worker gradients
despite data heterogeneity, which facilitates the identification of Byzantines'
gradients. This approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
heterogeneous settings. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and
empirical evidence of its effectiveness.

*Mikel Casals,Vasilis Belis,Elias F. Combarro,Eduard Alarcón,Sofia Vallecorsa,Michele Grossi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Guided Graph Compression (GGC), a framework using a graph autoencoder to compress graph data for improved performance in downstream tasks, tested on quantum and classical classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of GNNs with large graphs (high memory, inefficient GPU operations) and quantum hardware limitations by proposing a compression method.

Method: GGC uses a graph autoencoder to reduce node count and feature dimensionality, guided to enhance downstream task performance.

Result: GGC outperforms standalone autoencoder preprocessing and baseline classical GNNs, enabling QGNN testing on realistic datasets.

Conclusion: GGC effectively compresses graphs for better performance and facilitates QGNN research on practical applications like Jet Tagging.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured
data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and
inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a
promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic
approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been
explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the
dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches
either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work
introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph
autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node
features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream
classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical
classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a
classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that
involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.
The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing
step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the
testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

*Amit Baran Dey,Wasim Arif,Rakhesh Singh Kshetrimayum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning method classifies oil samples using dielectric properties via a microwave resonant sensor, achieving 99.41% accuracy with a random forest classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automated, non-destructive, and efficient classification of oil types in industrial settings.

Method: Uses a microwave resonant sensor to capture dielectric property variations, extracts features, and applies machine learning classifiers.

Result: Achieves 99.41% classification accuracy with a random forest classifier.

Conclusion: The method is viable for fast, reliable, and automated oil characterization in industrial environments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based methodology for the
classification of various oil samples based on their dielectric properties,
utilizing a microwave resonant sensor. The dielectric behaviour of oils,
governed by their molecular composition, induces distinct shifts in the
sensor's resonant frequency and amplitude response. These variations are
systematically captured and processed to extract salient features, which serve
as inputs for multiple machine learning classifiers. The microwave resonant
sensor operates in a non-destructive, low-power manner, making it particularly
well-suited for real-time industrial applications. A comprehensive dataset is
developed by varying the permittivity of oil samples and acquiring the
corresponding sensor responses. Several classifiers are trained and evaluated
using the extracted resonant features to assess their capability in
distinguishing between oil types. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves a high classification accuracy of 99.41% with the
random forest classifier, highlighting its strong potential for automated oil
identification. The system's compact form factor, efficiency, and high
performance underscore its viability for fast and reliable oil characterization
in industrial environments.

### [264] [Private Aggregation for Byzantine-Resilient Heterogeneous Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09870)
*Maximilian Egger,Rawad Bitar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of ensuring Byzantine resilience and client data privacy in federated learning (FL), especially under data heterogeneity. It proposes a multi-stage method combining verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and tailored symmetric private information retrieval to achieve privacy and resilience. The method outperforms existing techniques and is made scalable by reducing communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to protect client data privacy and ensure resilience against Byzantine attacks in FL, particularly when data is heterogeneous, drives this work. Existing methods fail in such settings, necessitating a new approach.

Method: A multi-stage approach integrating verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private information retrieval scheme. The method is evaluated against various attacks and optimized for communication efficiency.

Result: The proposed method achieves information-theoretic privacy guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity, outperforming prior techniques. It also reduces communication overhead.

Conclusion: The co-designed multi-stage method successfully addresses privacy and resilience challenges in FL with heterogeneous data, offering scalability through reduced communication costs.

Abstract: Ensuring resilience to Byzantine clients while maintaining the privacy of the
clients' data is a fundamental challenge in federated learning (FL). When the
clients' data is homogeneous, suitable countermeasures were studied from an
information-theoretic perspective utilizing secure aggregation techniques while
ensuring robust aggregation of the clients' gradients. However, the
countermeasures used fail when the clients' data is heterogeneous. Suitable
pre-processing techniques, such as nearest neighbor mixing, were recently shown
to enhance the performance of those countermeasures in the heterogeneous
setting. Nevertheless, those pre-processing techniques cannot be applied with
the introduced privacy-preserving mechanisms.
  We propose a multi-stage method encompassing a careful co-design of
verifiable secret sharing, secure aggregation, and a tailored symmetric private
information retrieval scheme to achieve information-theoretic privacy
guarantees and Byzantine resilience under data heterogeneity. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our scheme on a variety of attacks and show how it outperforms
the previously known techniques. Since the communication overhead of secure
aggregation is non-negligible, we investigate the interplay with zero-order
estimation methods that reduce the communication cost in state-of-the-art FL
tasks and thereby make private aggregation scalable.

*Nirmit Joshi,Hugo Koubbi,Theodor Misiakiewicz,Nathan Srebro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores learning single-index models, emphasizing the role of spherical harmonics over Hermite polynomials for capturing rotational symmetry. It introduces estimators for optimal sample complexity or runtime, revealing new insights for Gaussian inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of prior work that relied on Hermite expansions for learning single-index models, the authors propose spherical harmonics as a more natural basis due to their alignment with rotational symmetry.

Method: The authors introduce two estimators: one based on tensor unfolding for optimal sample complexity and another using online SGD for optimal runtime. They analyze these under spherically symmetric input distributions.

Result: The study shows that spherical harmonics provide a better framework for understanding the problem, leading to optimal estimators. For Gaussian inputs, it clarifies existing results and uncovers new phenomena.

Conclusion: Spherical harmonics are a superior basis for learning single-index models, enabling optimal estimators. The work also highlights trade-offs between sample complexity and runtime.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning single-index models, where the label $y \in
\mathbb{R}$ depends on the input $\boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ only through
an unknown one-dimensional projection $\langle
\boldsymbol{w}_*,\boldsymbol{x}\rangle$. Prior work has shown that under
Gaussian inputs, the statistical and computational complexity of recovering
$\boldsymbol{w}_*$ is governed by the Hermite expansion of the link function.
In this paper, we propose a new perspective: we argue that "spherical
harmonics" -- rather than "Hermite polynomials" -- provide the natural basis
for this problem, as they capture its intrinsic "rotational symmetry". Building
on this insight, we characterize the complexity of learning single-index models
under arbitrary spherically symmetric input distributions. We introduce two
families of estimators -- based on tensor unfolding and online SGD -- that
respectively achieve either optimal sample complexity or optimal runtime, and
argue that estimators achieving both may not exist in general. When specialized
to Gaussian inputs, our theory not only recovers and clarifies existing results
but also reveals new phenomena that had previously been overlooked.

TL;DR: A physics-informed, interpretable climate model emulator using causal representation learning is developed to efficiently and accurately emulate climate dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional climate models are computationally expensive, limiting predictions and analyses. Machine learning can emulate these models but lacks physics-informed causal relationships.

Method: The approach combines causal representation learning with a physics-informed Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation.

Result: The emulator accurately learns climate dynamics, validated on synthetic and real climate model data.

Conclusion: The proposed emulator effectively addresses computational limitations while maintaining accuracy and interpretability in climate modeling.

Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations
to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are
highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change
and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to
quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able
to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an
interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning.
We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable
long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns
accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its
components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed
climate models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how VQVAE suppresses adversarial attacks on high-SNR RF data, showing it reduces attack effectiveness and explores latent space properties for attack detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate VQVAE's ability to mitigate adversarial attacks on digitally modulated RF waveforms while preserving classification accuracy.

Method: Created adversarial attacks (phase-preserving and non-preserving), tested classifier accuracy on reconstructions, and compared latent space distributions under attack.

Result: VQVAE significantly reduces attack effectiveness and reveals latent space properties useful for attack detection.

Conclusion: VQVAE is effective in suppressing adversarial attacks and offers insights into latent space behavior under varying attack strengths.

Abstract: Having designed a VQVAE that maps digital radio waveforms into discrete
latent space, and yields a perfectly classifiable reconstruction of the
original data, we here analyze the attack suppressing properties of VQVAE when
an adversarial attack is performed on high-SNR radio-frequency (RF)
data-points. To target amplitude modulations from a subset of digitally
modulated waveform classes, we first create adversarial attacks that preserve
the phase between the in-phase and quadrature component whose values are
adversarially changed. We compare them with adversarial attacks of the same
intensity where phase is not preserved. We test the classification accuracy of
such adversarial examples on a classifier trained to deliver 100% accuracy on
the original data. To assess the ability of VQVAE to suppress the strength of
the attack, we evaluate the classifier accuracy on the reconstructions by VQVAE
of the adversarial datapoints and show that VQVAE substantially decreases the
effectiveness of the attack. We also compare the I/Q plane diagram of the
attacked data, their reconstructions and the original data. Finally, using
multiple methods and metrics, we compare the probability distribution of the
VQVAE latent space with and without attack. Varying the attack strength, we
observe interesting properties of the discrete space, which may help detect the
attacks.

TL;DR: DNA introduces a method for explainable RL by generating diverse, near-optimal trajectories for human choice, using reward shaping and modified Q-learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance explainability in RL by providing diverse trajectory options for human users to understand and choose from.

Method: Uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning to produce epsilon-optimal, distinct policies for trajectory planning.

Result: Successfully generates qualitatively different policies, offering meaningful options in simulations.

Conclusion: DNA advances explainable RL and opens new avenues for exploration and adaptive planning.

Abstract: In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to
explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives
(DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for
trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively
diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these
distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of
available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular,
DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where
agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which
uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for
distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it
successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute
meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to
related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity.
Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for
exploration and adaptive planning in RL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Verbalized Rejection Sampling (VRS) to improve LLMs' ability to generate faithful samples from Bernoulli distributions, reducing bias without modifying model internals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can describe probability distributions but struggle to generate accurate samples, limiting their use in stochastic tasks like Monte Carlo methods.

Method: The authors propose VRS, a natural-language adaptation of rejection sampling, prompting LLMs to reason about and accept/reject samples.

Result: VRS reduces sampling bias across models, with theoretical analysis showing improvements over direct sampling.

Conclusion: VRS demonstrates how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized in LLM workflows to enhance reliability without heavy engineering.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can often accurately describe probability
distributions using natural language, yet they still struggle to generate
faithful samples from them. This mismatch limits their use in tasks requiring
reliable stochasticity, such as Monte Carlo methods, agent-based simulations,
and randomized decision-making. We investigate this gap between knowledge and
sampling in the context of Bernoulli distributions. We introduce Verbalized
Rejection Sampling (VRS), a natural-language adaptation of classical rejection
sampling that prompts the LLM to reason about and accept or reject proposed
samples. Despite relying on the same Bernoulli mechanism internally, VRS
substantially reduces sampling bias across models. We provide theoretical
analysis showing that, under mild assumptions, VRS improves over direct
sampling, with gains attributable to both the algorithm and prompt design. More
broadly, our results show how classical probabilistic tools can be verbalized
and embedded into LLM workflows to improve reliability, without requiring
access to model internals or heavy prompt engineering.

*Liou Tang,James Joshi,Ashish Kundu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Apollo, a label-only membership inference attack targeting Machine Unlearning (MU), which infers unlearned data samples under a strict threat model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MU privacy attacks rely on weaker threat models, limiting real-world applicability. Apollo addresses this by operating under stricter conditions.

Method: Proposes Apollo, a label-only attack that infers unlearned samples using only the unlearned model's label outputs.

Result: Apollo achieves high precision in identifying unlearned samples despite requiring less model access than previous attacks.

Conclusion: Apollo demonstrates the feasibility of strong privacy attacks under strict threat models, highlighting vulnerabilities in MU systems.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to update Machine Learning (ML) models following
requests to remove training samples and their influences on a trained model
efficiently without retraining the original ML model from scratch. While MU
itself has been employed to provide privacy protection and regulatory
compliance, it can also increase the attack surface of the model. Existing
privacy inference attacks towards MU that aim to infer properties of the
unlearned set rely on the weaker threat model that assumes the attacker has
access to both the unlearned model and the original model, limiting their
feasibility toward real-life scenarios. We propose a novel privacy attack, A
Posteriori Label-Only Membership Inference Attack towards MU, Apollo, that
infers whether a data sample has been unlearned, following a strict threat
model where an adversary has access to the label-output of the unlearned model
only. We demonstrate that our proposed attack, while requiring less access to
the target model compared to previous attacks, can achieve relatively high
precision on the membership status of the unlearned samples.

Method: Uses MCMC and VI to approximate the posterior in PMF, evaluated on the MovieLens dataset.

Result: VI converges faster, but MCMC provides more accurate posterior estimates.

Conclusion: VI is efficient for speed, while MCMC is preferred for accuracy in PMF.

Abstract: Matrix factorization is a widely used technique in recommendation systems.
Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [1] extends traditional matrix
factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors,
allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior
distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address
this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
[2] and Variational Inference (VI) [3] to approximate the posterior. We
evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset and compare their convergence
speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more
accurate posterior estimates.

### [272] [The Sample Complexity of Online Strategic Decision Making with Information Asymmetry and Knowledge Transportability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09940)
*Jiachen Hu,Rui Ai,Han Zhong,Xiaoyu Chen,Liwei Wang,Zhaoran Wang,Zhuoran Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses learning under information asymmetry and knowledge transfer challenges in multi-agent systems, proposing a sample-efficient algorithm for identifying system dynamics and achieving optimal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Information asymmetry and knowledge transportability complicate strategic interactions in multi-agent systems, necessitating methods to learn confounders and transfer knowledge effectively.

Method: The paper introduces a sample-efficient algorithm for reinforcement learning in online strategic interactions, designed to handle non-i.i.d. actions and knowledge transfer.

Result: The algorithm provably learns an ϵ-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of O(1/ϵ²).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of information asymmetry and knowledge transfer, offering a practical solution for online learning in strategic settings.

Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems,
especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents
tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards.
These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding
variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant
challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target
environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where
empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper
explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d.
actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We
present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system
dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of
knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an
online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.

### [273] [Canonical Latent Representations in Conditional Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09955)
*Yitao Xu,Tong Zhang,Ehsan Pajouheshgar,Sabine Süsstrunk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces CLAReps, latent codes in CDMs that preserve class-defining features while discarding irrelevant context, enabling interpretable and robust representation learning via the CaDistill method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CDMs entangle class-defining features with irrelevant context, making it hard to extract robust and interpretable representations. The goal is to disentangle these features for better discriminative learning.

Method: Develop CLAReps to capture core class semantics and discard non-discriminative signals. Use these in CaDistill, a diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm where a CDM teacher transfers knowledge via CLAReps to a student model.

Result: The student model achieves strong adversarial robustness and generalization, focusing on class signals rather than spurious cues, using only 10% of training data size.

Conclusion: CDMs can act as compact, interpretable teachers for robust representation learning, beyond just image generation.

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across
a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution
has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative
learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the
class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to
extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify
Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM
features preserve essential categorical information while discarding
non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative
samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the
core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we
develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While
the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers
core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the
training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial
robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals
instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve
not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that
can drive robust representation learning.

### [274] [Multiverse: Your Language Models Secretly Decide How to Parallelize and Merge Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09991)
*Xinyu Yang,Yuwei An,Hongyi Liu,Tianqi Chen,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multiverse is a parallel generative model inspired by AR-LLMs, using a MapReduce paradigm for adaptive task decomposition, parallel execution, and lossless synthesis. It achieves performance comparable to AR-LLMs with superior scaling and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sequential limitations of AR-LLMs by enabling natively parallel generation, improving efficiency and scalability.

Method: Multiverse employs a MapReduce paradigm (Map, Process, Reduce), Multiverse Attention for parallel reasoning, and a Multiverse Engine for dynamic parallel inference.

Result: Multiverse-32B matches AR-LLM performance (AIME24: 54%, AIME25: 46%) with 1.87% better scaling and up to 2x speedup.

Conclusion: Multiverse offers a scalable, efficient alternative to AR-LLMs, with open-sourced tools and data for broader adoption.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) frequently exhibit implicit
parallelism in sequential generation. Inspired by this, we introduce
Multiverse, a new generative model that enables natively parallel generation.
Multiverse internalizes a MapReduce paradigm, generating automatically through
three stages: (i) a Map stage for adaptive task decomposition, (ii) a Process
stage for parallel subtask execution, and (iii) a Reduce stage for lossless
result synthesis. Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with
co-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer
from frontier AR-LLMs. Starting from sequential reasoning chains, we create
Multiverse 1K by converting them into structured training data using an
automated LLM-assisted pipeline, avoiding costly human annotations.
Algorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning
steps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.
Systematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to enable parallel inference. It
features a dedicated scheduler that dynamically switches between sequential and
parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a 3-hour
fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only
open-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of
the same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.
Moreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits
superior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same
context length. Such scaling further leads to practical efficiency gain,
achieving up to 2x speedup across varying batch sizes. We have open-sourced the
entire Multiverse ecosystem, including data, model weights, engine, supporting
tools, as well as complete data curation prompts and detailed training and
evaluation recipes.

*Pierre Vernimmen,François Glineur*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of first-order optimization methods under gradient computation inexactness, introduces a shortening factor to improve robustness, and tests methods on an inexact problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how gradient computation inexactness (e.g., due to compression) affects optimization methods, especially for large-scale GPU problems.

Method: Analyzes three families of methods (constant step gradient descent, long-step, and accelerated) theoretically and empirically, introduces a shortening factor, and tests them under two types of inexactness.

Result: Accelerated methods are more robust than expected; the shortening factor improves long-step methods. All shortened methods perform well in inexact settings.

Conclusion: Shortened optimization methods are promising even with inexact gradient computations, offering practical solutions for large-scale problems.

Abstract: This work assesses both empirically and theoretically, using the performance
estimation methodology, how robust different first-order optimization methods
are when subject to relative inexactness in their gradient computations.
Relative inexactness occurs, for example, when compressing the gradient using
fewer bits of information, which happens when dealing with large-scale problems
on GPUs. Three major families of methods are analyzed: constant step gradient
descent, long-step methods, and accelerated methods. The latter two are first
shown to be theoretically not robust to inexactness. Then, a semi-heuristic
shortening factor is introduced to improve their theoretical guarantees. All
methods are subsequently tested on a concrete inexact problem, with two
different types of relative inexactness, and it is observed that both
accelerated methods are much more robust than expected, and that the shortening
factor significantly helps the long-step methods. In the end, all shortened
methods appear to be promising, even in this inexact setting.

TL;DR: The paper explores improving Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET) for Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) using motif-based optimization to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As DNNs grow in complexity, reducing computational costs and memory overheads is critical. Sparsity, particularly in MLPs, offers a solution.

Method: The study applies motif-based optimization to the SET algorithm for MLPs to enhance performance.

Result: Potential efficiency gains exceed 40% with a performance decline under 4%.

Conclusion: Structural optimization of SET-MLP can significantly improve performance, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective
and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as
DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs
and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a
leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons
(MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse
Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing
computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed
that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization
method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains
exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates
whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to
Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) can enhance performance and to what extent
this improvement can be achieved.

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework infers genetic distances between unsequenced and known pathogen cases using time-aware evolutionary modeling, enhancing genomic dataset utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete pathogen genome sequencing limits spatial models; this method addresses gaps by inferring genetic distances for unsequenced cases.

Method: Uses time-aware evolutionary distance modeling to estimate pairwise divergence from collection dates and observed genetic distances, avoiding sequence alignment or known transmission chains.

Result: Applied to avian influenza cases, it enables scalable, uncertainty-aware genomic dataset augmentation and better spatiotemporal modeling.

Conclusion: The framework improves genomic data integration into spatiotemporal workflows, supporting more robust pathogen analysis.

Abstract: Pathogen genome data offers valuable structure for spatial models, but its
utility is limited by incomplete sequencing coverage. We propose a
probabilistic framework for inferring genetic distances between unsequenced
cases and known sequences within defined transmission chains, using time-aware
evolutionary distance modeling. The method estimates pairwise divergence from
collection dates and observed genetic distances, enabling biologically
plausible imputation grounded in observed divergence patterns, without
requiring sequence alignment or known transmission chains. Applied to highly
pathogenic avian influenza A/H5 cases in wild birds in the United States, this
approach supports scalable, uncertainty-aware augmentation of genomic datasets
and enhances the integration of evolutionary information into spatiotemporal
modeling workflows.

TL;DR: ThinkQE improves web search query expansion by promoting exploration and diversity, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based query expansions are narrowly focused, missing diverse interpretations. ThinkQE addresses this gap.

Method: ThinkQE uses a thinking-based expansion process and corpus-interaction strategy for iterative refinement.

Result: ThinkQE outperforms prior methods on benchmarks like DL19, DL20, and BRIGHT.

Conclusion: ThinkQE effectively enhances query expansion by balancing exploration and diversity, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Effective query expansion for web search benefits from promoting both
exploration and result diversity to capture multiple interpretations and facets
of a query. While recent LLM-based methods have improved retrieval performance
and demonstrate strong domain generalization without additional training, they
often generate narrowly focused expansions that overlook these desiderata. We
propose ThinkQE, a test-time query expansion framework addressing this
limitation through two key components: a thinking-based expansion process that
encourages deeper and comprehensive semantic exploration, and a
corpus-interaction strategy that iteratively refines expansions using retrieval
feedback from the corpus. Experiments on diverse web search benchmarks (DL19,
DL20, and BRIGHT) show ThinkQE consistently outperforms prior approaches,
including training-intensive dense retrievers and rerankers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving customer experience and retail sales by addressing noisy and sparse user-item interactions.

Method: Projects a directed weighted graph from user-item bipartite graph to infer complementarity relationships.

Result: Average improvements of +43% over sequential and +38% over graph-based recommenders.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for complementary product recommendation despite its simplicity.

Abstract: Complementary product recommendation is a powerful strategy to improve
customer experience and retail sales. However, recommending the right product
is not a simple task because of the noisy and sparse nature of user-item
interactions. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to predict
a list of complementary products given a query item, based on the structure of
a directed weighted graph projected from the user-item bipartite graph. We
revisit bipartite graph projections for recommender systems and propose a novel
approach for inferring complementarity relationships from historical user-item
interactions. We compare our model with recent methods from the literature and
show, despite the simplicity of our approach, an average improvement of +43%
and +38% over sequential and graph-based recommenders, respectively, over
different benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS is inefficient on mobile devices, failing to meet real-time 90 FPS due to memory inefficiency and redundant DRAM traffic.

Method: STREAMINGGS introduces a streaming co-design, shifting from tile-centric to memory-centric rendering for fine-grained pipelining and reduced DRAM traffic.

Result: Achieves up to 45.7x speedup and 62.9x energy savings compared to mobile Ampere GPUs.

Conclusion: STREAMINGGS successfully addresses 3DGS inefficiencies on mobile devices, enabling real-time performance with significant speed and energy improvements.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and
sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the
real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained
mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on
compute efficiency but overlook memory efficiency, leading to redundant DRAM
traffic. We introduce STREAMINGGS, a fully streaming 3DGS
algorithm-architecture co-design that achieves fine-grained pipelining and
reduces DRAM traffic by transforming from a tile-centric rendering to a
memory-centric rendering. Results show that our design achieves up to 45.7

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A simple Transformer-based framework for motion in-betweening outperforms complex models by focusing on data modeling choices like pose representation and velocity features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify motion in-betweening by challenging the assumption that model complexity is key, and instead emphasizing data-centric approaches.

Method: Uses a single Transformer encoder for motion synthesis, highlighting the importance of data volume, pose representation, and velocity features.

Result: Demonstrates that simpler models can achieve high-quality motion transitions with proper data modeling, outperforming complex architectures.

Conclusion: Model complexity is not the primary factor for animation quality; data-centric approaches like pose representation and velocity features are more impactful.

Abstract: Motion in-betweening is a crucial tool for animators, enabling intricate
control over pose-level details in each keyframe. Recent machine learning
solutions for motion in-betweening rely on complex models, incorporating
skeleton-aware architectures or requiring multiple modules and training steps.
In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective Transformer-based framework,
employing a single Transformer encoder to synthesize realistic motions for
motion in-betweening tasks. We find that data modeling choices play a
significant role in improving in-betweening performance. Among others, we show
that increasing data volume can yield equivalent or improved motion
transitions, that the choice of pose representation is vital for achieving
high-quality results, and that incorporating velocity input features enhances
animation performance. These findings challenge the assumption that model
complexity is the primary determinant of animation quality and provide insights
into a more data-centric approach to motion interpolation. Additional videos

Method: 1. Fine-tune video diffusion models to respect geometry and lighting. 2. Extract intrinsics (base color, roughness, metallic) from generated videos. 3. Use differentiable path tracing to extract PBR materials.

Result: Coherent material properties across multiple views, directly compatible with common tools.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges generative models and 3D content creation, enabling high-quality material generation.

Abstract: We leverage finetuned video diffusion models, intrinsic decomposition of

materials for 3D models given a text prompt or a single image. We condition a
video diffusion model to respect the input geometry and lighting condition.
This model produces multiple views of a given 3D model with coherent material
properties. Secondly, we use a recent model to extract intrinsics (base color,

Motivation: Existing feed-forward scene reconstruction models are limited to static scenes, lacking the ability to capture dynamic motion. DGS-LRM aims to address this gap by enabling dynamic scene reconstruction.

Method: The approach includes a synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos, a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation, and a transformer network for real-time reconstruction.

Result: DGS-LRM matches optimization-based methods in quality and outperforms state-of-the-art predictive methods in real-world scenarios, excelling in 3D tracking tasks.

Conclusion: DGS-LRM advances dynamic scene reconstruction, offering high-quality, real-time performance and adaptability for tracking tasks.

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model
(DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian
splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene
reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly
create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing
models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of
moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene
reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training
data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To
address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an
enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and
dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian
representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view
synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network
that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves
dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods,
while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic
reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded
3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking
tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D

TL;DR: AI-driven peer support using LLMs shows promise but reveals gaps in training and safety, highlighting the need for standardized, expert-guided solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing global mental health concerns by leveraging AI to enhance peer support, ensuring quality and safety in real-time interactions.

Method: Developed an AI system with an LLM-simulated client, context-sensitive suggestions, and emotion visualizations. Evaluated through mixed-methods studies with peer supporters and experts.

Result: Peer supporters and experts recognized the system's potential but identified critical issues like missed distress cues, emphasizing training gaps.

Conclusion: Standardized, expert-guided training is essential for scaling peer support safely, with LLMs offering valuable support if carefully designed.

Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven
solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in
lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However,
variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about
quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new
opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time,
text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an
LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions,
and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer
supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the
system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised
its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we
found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully,
experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such
as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment
highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially
in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are
essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically
grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also
demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if
designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to
emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the
evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.

Result: Revealed motivations, emotional labor, and sociocultural factors in peer support, leading to design implications for AI tools that respect relational care.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for culturally sensitive AI in mental health, grounded in the lived experiences of peer supporters.

Abstract: Peer support plays a vital role in expanding access to mental health care by
providing empathetic, community-based support outside formal clinical systems.
As digital platforms increasingly mediate such support, the design and impact
of these technologies remain under-examined, particularly in Asian contexts.
This paper presents findings from an interview study with 20 peer supporters in
Singapore, who operate across diverse online, offline, and hybrid environments.
Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and
sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the
sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded
understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital
tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from
qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might
responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred
computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing

*Hetvi Waghela,Jaydip Sen,Sneha Rakshit,Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP), a novel adversarial attack method for NLP models that generates context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents, ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods focus on word-level or local text alterations, often resulting in detectable or semantically inconsistent perturbations. The paper aims to address this limitation by considering broader context.

Method: DCP leverages pre-trained language models to dynamically generate and iteratively refine perturbations using an adversarial objective function that balances misclassification and text naturalness.

Result: Experiments on various NLP models and datasets show DCP's effectiveness in challenging state-of-the-art NLP systems, producing more sophisticated adversarial examples.

Conclusion: DCP highlights the importance of context in adversarial attacks and provides a foundation for developing more robust NLP systems.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models expose
vulnerabilities by introducing subtle perturbations to input text, often
leading to misclassification while maintaining human readability. Existing
methods typically focus on word-level or local text segment alterations,
overlooking the broader context, which results in detectable or semantically
inconsistent perturbations. We propose a novel adversarial text attack scheme
named Dynamic Contextual Perturbation (DCP). DCP dynamically generates
context-aware perturbations across sentences, paragraphs, and documents,
ensuring semantic fidelity and fluency. Leveraging the capabilities of
pre-trained language models, DCP iteratively refines perturbations through an
adversarial objective function that balances the dual objectives of inducing
model misclassification and preserving the naturalness of the text. This
comprehensive approach allows DCP to produce more sophisticated and effective
adversarial examples that better mimic natural language patterns. Our
experimental results, conducted on various NLP models and datasets, demonstrate
the efficacy of DCP in challenging the robustness of state-of-the-art NLP
systems. By integrating dynamic contextual analysis, DCP significantly enhances
the subtlety and impact of adversarial attacks. This study highlights the
critical role of context in adversarial attacks and lays the groundwork for
creating more robust NLP systems capable of withstanding sophisticated

### [288] [Empirical Quantification of Spurious Correlations in Malware Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09662)
*Bianca Perasso,Ludovico Lozza,Andrea Ponte,Luca Demetrio,Luca Oneto,Fabio Roli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper investigates how spurious correlations in deep learning for malware detection affect model decisions, focusing on reliance on compiler-empty spaces, and ranks two models for production suitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of spurious correlations (like metadata) on deep learning models in malware detection and quantify their influence on decisions.

Method: Seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, evaluating reliance on compiler-empty spaces and comparing two end-to-end models.

Result: Models heavily rely on empty spaces left by compilers, reducing the relevance of compiled code. A ranking of two models is provided for production suitability.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to address spurious correlations in deep learning for malware detection and offers insights for selecting production-ready models.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting
malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations
-- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless
through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks
mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without
quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our
understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware
detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the
compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our
seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of
two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in
production.

*Yitong Zhang,Jia Li,Liyi Cai,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DAVSP introduces a Visual Safety Prompt and Deep Alignment to enhance LVLM security against malicious queries while maintaining utility on benign inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are vulnerable to malicious visual queries, and existing alignment methods fail to balance security and utility.

Method: Proposes Visual Safety Prompt (trainable padding around images) and Deep Alignment (training via model activation space supervision).

Result: DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries, preserves utility on benign inputs, and shows cross-model generalization.

Conclusion: DAVSP's innovations are essential for robust LVLM alignment, offering improved security and utility.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress across
various applications but remain vulnerable to malicious queries that exploit
the visual modality. Existing alignment approaches typically fail to resist
malicious queries while preserving utility on benign ones effectively. To
address these challenges, we propose Deep Aligned Visual Safety Prompt (DAVSP),
which is built upon two key innovations. First, we introduce the Visual Safety
Prompt, which appends a trainable padding region around the input image. It
preserves visual features and expands the optimization space. Second, we
propose Deep Alignment, a novel approach to train the visual safety prompt
through supervision in the model's activation space. It enhances the inherent
ability of LVLMs to perceive malicious queries, achieving deeper alignment than
prior works. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks on two representative
LVLMs demonstrate that DAVSP effectively resists malicious queries while
preserving benign input utility. Furthermore, DAVSP exhibits great cross-model
generation ability. Ablation studies further reveal that both the Visual Safety
Prompt and Deep Alignment are essential components, jointly contributing to its
overall effectiveness. The code is publicly available at

### [290] [What is the Cost of Differential Privacy for Deep Learning-Based Trajectory Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09312)
*Erik Buchholz,Natasha Fernandes,David D. Nguyen,Alsharif Abuadbba,Surya Nepal,Salil S. Kanhere*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper explores the utility-privacy trade-off in differentially private (DP) trajectory generation, evaluating DP-SGD's impact, proposing a novel DP mechanism for conditional generation, and comparing model types (Diffusion, VAE, GAN).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Location trajectories are sensitive, and while DP provides privacy guarantees, balancing utility and privacy is challenging. Current deep learning-based models lack formal privacy assurances.

Method: The study evaluates DP-SGD's effect on generative models, introduces a DP mechanism for conditional generation, and compares Diffusion, VAE, and GAN models across datasets and utility metrics.

Result: DP-SGD reduces utility but retains some with large datasets. The proposed DP mechanism stabilizes training, especially for GANs. Diffusion models excel without guarantees, while GANs perform best with DP-SGD.

Conclusion: DP trajectory generation is challenging; formal guarantees require large datasets and constrained use cases, with GANs outperforming others under DP constraints.

Abstract: While location trajectories offer valuable insights, they also reveal
sensitive personal information. Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal
protection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains
challenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to
produce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy
guarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during
generation. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such
models, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven
utility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method
for deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.
(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP
mechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess
its impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN
- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD
significantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the
datasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training
stability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as
GANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without
guarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best
non-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.
In conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal
guarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained
use cases.

### [291] [TooBadRL: Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09562)
*Songze Li,Mingxuan Zhang,Oubo Ma,Kang Wei,Shouling Ji*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TooBadRL optimizes DRL backdoor triggers along temporal, spatial, and magnitude axes, significantly improving attack success rates while minimizing performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks on DRL use simplistic triggers, overlooking the potential of optimized triggers.

Method: TooBadRL introduces adaptive freezing for timing, Shapley value analysis for dimension selection, and gradient-based optimization for magnitude.

Result: Evaluations show improved attack success rates on three DRL algorithms and nine tasks with minimal performance impact.

Conclusion: Principled trigger optimization is crucial for effective DRL backdoor attacks, as demonstrated by TooBadRL.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide
range of sequential decision-making domains, including robotics, healthcare,
smart grids, and finance. Recent research demonstrates that attackers can
efficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute
backdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns
are present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks
rely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking
the potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we
introduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor
Attacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor
triggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.
Specifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing
mechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a
cooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most
influential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose
a gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude
under environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms
and nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack
success rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.
These results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of
principled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks. The source code of
TooBadRL can be found at https://github.com/S3IC-Lab/TooBadRL.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper discusses Indirect Prompt Injection attacks on LLMs, introduces LLMail-Inject challenge to evaluate defenses, and provides a dataset for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation against adaptive adversaries in LLM security, given the wide implications of successful attacks.

Method: Conducted the LLMail-Inject challenge, simulating realistic email scenarios with adaptive attacks, spanning multiple defenses, LLM architectures, and retrieval configurations.

Result: Generated a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions from 839 participants, revealing insights into instruction-data separation.

Conclusion: The findings aim to support future research for practical solutions to prompt injection, with released challenge code and dataset.

Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their
inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against
adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have
wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based
applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a
public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants
adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to
trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge
spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval
configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions
from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of
submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new
insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve
as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to
prompt injection.

*Athena Vakali,Ilias Dimitriadis*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes FAIRTOPIA, a framework using multi-role agents to enforce fairness in AI pipelines, addressing biases at all stages (pre, in, post) with a human-centric approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI models often act without human oversight, leading to harmful incidents and unfairness. Current pipelines neglect human principles, necessitating a systematic fairness solution.

Method: Introduces a fairness-by-design approach with multi-role agents in an end-to-end synergetic scheme, structured as a three-layered architecture (FAIRTOPIA).

Result: A generalized algorithm adaptable to various AI scenarios, enabling fairness watch across all pipeline stages via robust multi-agent workflows.

Conclusion: FAIRTOPIA offers a human-centric, adaptive framework for AI fairness, inspiring future research grounded in socio-technical principles.

Abstract: AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human
supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful
incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily
criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human
principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre),
model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting
the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and
ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric
fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents
learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex
problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the
proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a
fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end
(human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive
and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm
which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision
making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured
over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an
agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on
our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages,
under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research
hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic,
interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.

### [295] [Understanding Human-AI Trust in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09160)
*Griffin Pitts,Sanaz Motamedi*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores how students trust AI chatbots, distinguishing between human-like and system-like trust, and their impact on engagement and learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity in whether students trust AI chatbots like humans or technology, given their anthropomorphic traits.

Method: Partial least squares structural equation modeling to analyze the effects of human-like and system-like trust on student perceptions.

Result: Human-like trust predicts trusting intention, while system-like trust predicts behavioral intention and usefulness. Both similarly affect enjoyment.

Conclusion: Students develop a unique human-AI trust, distinct from human-human or human-technology trust, necessitating new theoretical frameworks.

Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are
turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the
anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding
whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or
instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of
technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical
challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human
intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed
for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic
systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and
system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived
enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived
usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and
learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling,
we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student
perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted
trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral
intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived
enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we
propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots
(human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of
trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific
to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately
calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical
impact of AI in education.

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical model for Devanagari handwritten digit recognition achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming classical CNNs with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in recognizing complex scripts like Devanagari due to limited datasets and structural complexity, while exploring quantum machine learning's potential.

Method: Combines a CNN for spatial features with a 10-qubit VQC for quantum-enhanced classification, trained on the DHCD dataset.

Result: Achieves 99.80% test accuracy, 0.2893 test loss, and 0.9980 F1-score, surpassing classical CNNs in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Demonstrates quantum machine learning's promise for regional script recognition, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Handwritten digit recognition in regional scripts, such as Devanagari, is
crucial for multilingual document digitization, educational tools, and the
preservation of cultural heritage. The script's complex structure and limited
annotated datasets pose significant challenges to conventional models. This
paper introduces the first hybrid quantum-classical architecture for Devanagari
handwritten digit recognition, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)
for spatial feature extraction with a 10-qubit variational quantum circuit
(VQC) for quantum-enhanced classification. Trained and evaluated on the
Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD), the proposed model achieves a
state-of-the-art test accuracy for quantum implementation of 99.80% and a test
loss of 0.2893, with an average per-class F1-score of 0.9980. Compared to
equivalent classical CNNs, our model demonstrates superior accuracy with
significantly fewer parameters and enhanced robustness. By leveraging quantum
principles such as superposition and entanglement, this work establishes a
novel benchmark for regional script recognition, highlighting the promise of
quantum machine learning (QML) in real-world, low-resource language settings.

*James R. Williamson,Andrew Alini,Brian A. Telfer,Adam W. Potter,Karl E. Friedl*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and physical activity (PA), using NHANES data and advanced modeling techniques to estimate VAT from PA, achieving high accuracy (r=0.86).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Excess VAT is linked to metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes, and understanding its relationship with PA can help assess metabolic health risks.

Method: Two approaches were used: (1) engineered features with ridge regression, and (2) deep neural networks with a transformer model, both enhanced by demographic and body measurement covariates.

Result: Combining both methods yielded highly accurate VAT estimates (r=0.86), showing a strong PA-VAT relationship.

Conclusion: PA strongly correlates with VAT, highlighting its role in metabolic health risk assessment.

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and
habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2
diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology
relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile
fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during
exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can
also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for
individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men;
2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity.
The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep,
and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a
VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours
of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame
into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each
day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over
multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained
with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body
measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two
approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These
findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by
extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

Motivation: To develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by combining CPC's predictive structure learning with SNN's spike-based processing.

Method: Integration of CPC with SNN, tested on the MNIST dataset to classify sequential vs. non-sequential samples.

Result: High classification rate, demonstrating effective combination of CPC and SNN for both classification and encoding tasks.

Conclusion: CPC can be successfully integrated with SNN, enhancing biological plausibility and functionality in predictive coding models.

Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC)
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure
of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational
processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to
develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by
processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was
tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in
distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative
samples. The study demonstrates that CPC can be effectively combined with SNN,
showing that an SNN trained for classification tasks can also function as an
encoding mechanism. Project codes and detailed results can be accessed on our

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) method to optimize multi-UAV systems, balancing service coverage and battery lifetime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the dual challenges of maximizing service coverage and extending battery life in multi-UAV systems.

Method: Uses a graph attention network for local observation processing and an actor-double-critic network for dual-policy optimization, incorporating KL divergence for balance.

Result: GADC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scalability and efficiency, validated in ideal and realistic environments.

Conclusion: GADC effectively optimizes multi-UAV systems by balancing coverage and battery lifetime, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: This research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives:
maximizing service coverage as the primary goal while extending battery
lifetime as the secondary objective. We propose a Graph Attention-based
Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) to optimize the dual objectives. The proposed
approach leverages a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local
observation and reduce the dimension of the environment states. Subsequently,
an actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint
objective optimization. The proposed GADC uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and
battery lifetime in the multi-UAV system. We assess the scalability and
efficiency of GADC through comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art
methods, considering both theory and experimental aspects. Extensive testing in
both ideal settings and NVIDIA Sionna's realistic ray tracing environment
demonstrates GADC's superior performance.

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using XGBoost and SHAP scoring is proposed to rank impactful SEEG channels for epilepsy evaluation, improving efficiency and expanding search for epileptogenic zones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual inspection of SEEG signals is time-consuming and inefficient, necessitating an automated method to identify impactful channels.

Method: XGBoost is trained on clinician-selected and computational features, and SHAP scoring ranks channels by seizure contribution. A channel extension strategy broadens the search for epileptogenic zones.

Result: Validation on five patients showed promising accuracy, consistency, and explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently ranks SEEG channels, aiding in identifying epileptogenic zones beyond clinician selections.

Abstract: Stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) is an invasive technique to implant
depth electrodes and collect data for pre-surgery evaluation. Visual inspection
of signals recorded from hundreds of channels is time consuming and
inefficient. We propose a machine learning approach to rank the impactful
channels by incorporating clinician's selection and computational finding. A
classification model using XGBoost is trained to learn the discriminative
features of each channel during ictal periods. Then, the SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) scoring is utilized to rank SEEG channels based on their
contribution to seizures. A channel extension strategy is also incorporated to
expand the search space and identify suspicious epileptogenic zones beyond
those selected by clinicians. For validation, SEEG data for five patients were
analyzed showing promising results in terms of accuracy, consistency, and
explainability.

TL;DR: The paper extends cross-channel unlabeled sensing to signals in a union of subspaces, improving sample bounds and supporting complex structures like compressed sensing. Validated in whole-brain calcium imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of recovering multi-channel signals from shuffled measurements, common in applications like calcium imaging or multi-target tracking.

Method: Expands the framework to union of subspaces, derives tighter sample bounds, and supports general signal types.

Result: Achieves accurate signal reconstruction in real-world settings, such as whole-brain calcium imaging with disrupted mappings.

Conclusion: The framework is effective for complex signal structures and practical applications with imprecise sample-channel associations.

Abstract: Cross-channel unlabeled sensing addresses the problem of recovering a
multi-channel signal from measurements that were shuffled across channels. This
work expands the cross-channel unlabeled sensing framework to signals that lie
in a union of subspaces. The extension allows for handling more complex signal
structures and broadens the framework to tasks like compressed sensing. These
mismatches between samples and channels often arise in applications such as
whole-brain calcium imaging of freely moving organisms or multi-target
tracking. We improve over previous models by deriving tighter bounds on the
required number of samples for unique reconstruction, while supporting more
general signal types. The approach is validated through an application in
whole-brain calcium imaging, where organism movements disrupt sample-to-neuron
mappings. This demonstrates the utility of our framework in real-world settings
with imprecise sample-channel associations, achieving accurate signal
reconstruction.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores how spatial attention influences task representation and planning in humans, using virtual maze navigation to show proximity and natural attention contours simplify representations. Individual differences in attention explain behavioral variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the perceptual and attentional mechanisms that shape how humans construct simplified mental representations for efficient and flexible planning.

Method: Virtual maze navigation experiments to analyze how spatial attention controls task representation availability for planning.

Result: Spatial proximity and natural attention contours simplify maze representations, with individual differences in attention affecting behavior.

Conclusion: Incorporating visuospatial attention into computational models bridges perception and decision-making, enhancing understanding of human planning.

Abstract: Human planning is efficient -- it frugally deploys limited cognitive
resources to accomplish difficult tasks -- and flexible -- adapting to novel
problems and environments. Computational approaches suggest that people
construct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the
complexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a
nested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes
planning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this
interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to
characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task
representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We
find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for
planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised)
contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful
maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across
individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and
behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the
effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of
value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives
on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals
represent their environments in aid of planning.

Method: UTGenerator (LLM-driven test case generator) and UTBoost (test case augmentation framework) analyze codebases to generate additional test cases.

Result: Identified 36 insufficient test cases, uncovered 345 erroneous patches, and impacted leaderboard rankings (40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite, 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified).

Conclusion: UTGenerator and UTBoost enhance evaluation accuracy by addressing test case insufficiency in SWE-Bench.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of
coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for
evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses
real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull
requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull
requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests
without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce
UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes
codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python
projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive
framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task
instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches
incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections,
impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard
entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.

### [304] [Reasoning as a Resource: Optimizing Fast and Slow Thinking in Code Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09396)
*Zongjie Li,Shuai Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper advocates for treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource in code generation models, balancing fast and slow thinking to optimize accuracy, latency, and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack explicit control over reasoning depth, missing opportunities to optimize performance and efficiency across the model lifecycle.

Method: Proposes adaptive control over reasoning depth, influencing data creation, benchmarking, and deployment policies.

Result: Enables better trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost, with potential for enriched supervision and new benchmarks.

Conclusion: Viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes can lead to more efficient and adaptable coding agents.

Abstract: This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation
models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being
an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between
rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought
deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that
optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic
data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior
trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive
control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new
multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious
deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes
to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and
act fast when possible.

*Emma Kallina,Thomas Bohné,Jat Singh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The study examines how stakeholder involvement (SHI) in commercial AI development aligns with Responsible AI (rAI) goals, finding a disconnect due to commercial priorities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify if existing SHI practices in commercial settings contribute to rAI goals and identify gaps.

Method: Analyzed 56 rAI guidance documents, conducted an online survey (n=130), and semi-structured interviews (n=10) with AI practitioners.

Result: SHI in practice is driven by commercial priorities, not rAI goals, revealing a disconnect.

Conclusion: Proposes interventions and research to align SHI practices with rAI efforts.

Abstract: Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement
(SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in
commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This
study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to
contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential
insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry
practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to
identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and
uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical
understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To
understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we
then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10)
with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily
driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several
factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that
established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To
address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to
advance rAI development in practice.

### [306] [EdgeProfiler: A Fast Profiling Framework for Lightweight LLMs on Edge Using Analytical Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09061)
*Alyssa Pinnock,Shakya Jayakody,Kawsher A Roxy,Md Rubel Ahmed*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: EdgeProfiler is a profiling framework for lightweight LLMs on edge systems, using quantization to reduce memory and energy usage while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are typically resource-heavy, limiting their use to cloud environments. EdgeProfiler aims to enable their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: The framework profiles compact LLMs (e.g., TinyLLaMA) using aggressive quantization and analytical modeling to estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption.

Result: 4-bit quantization reduces memory by 60-70% and maintains accuracy within 2-5% of baselines, with 2-3x faster inference and 35-50% lower energy use.

Conclusion: EdgeProfiler demonstrates efficient profiling for lightweight LLMs, balancing accuracy and energy efficiency for edge deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for
evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs
offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation,
their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to
cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a
systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained
edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA,
Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization
techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to
estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that
4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while
maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds
are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge
devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for
INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as
Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the
importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge
environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational
feasibility.

*Xiangchen Li,Dimitrios Spatharakis,Saeid Ghafouri,Jiakun Fan,Dimitrios Nikolopoulos*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SLED introduces speculative decoding for edge computing, enabling lightweight devices to draft tokens locally while a server verifies them, reducing latency and energy use without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient LLM inferencing at the edge is hindered by device limitations; existing methods compromise accuracy or cost.

Method: SLED uses speculative decoding: edge devices draft tokens locally, and a server verifies them with a shared target model.

Result: Experiments show reduced latency, better energy efficiency, and more concurrent sessions without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: SLED is a promising approach for efficient edge-based LLM inferencing, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: Regardless the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing
advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to
limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as
aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for
efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces
a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily
as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as
a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating
computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose SLED, a method that allows
lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using
diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches
and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach
supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by
avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments
with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, and an RTX 6000 edge server indicate
substantial benefits: significantly reduced latency, improved energy
efficiency, and increased concurrent inference sessions, all without
sacrificing model accuracy.

### [308] [TTrace: Lightweight Error Checking and Diagnosis for Distributed Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09280)
*Haitian Jiang,Shaowei Zhu,Zhen Zhang,Zhenyu Song,Xinwei Fu,Zhen Jia,Yida Wang,Jinyang Li*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: TTrace is a system designed to detect and localize silent bugs in distributed training by comparing intermediate tensors against a trusted reference, using novel mathematical analysis for accurate threshold setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed training for large models is prone to silent bugs, which are hard to detect using traditional metrics, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: TTrace collects fine-grained intermediate tensors and compares them to a single-device reference, using mathematical analysis to set thresholds for distinguishing bugs from floating-point errors.

Result: TTrace detected 11 existing and 3 new bugs in Megatron-LM with minimal code changes and worked effectively in low-precision training.

Conclusion: TTrace provides an efficient and effective solution for detecting silent bugs in distributed training, even in low-precision scenarios.

Abstract: Distributed training is essential for scaling the training of large neural
network models, such as large language models (LLMs), across thousands of GPUs.
However, the complexity of distributed training programs makes them
particularly prone to silent bugs, which do not produce explicit error signal
but lead to incorrect training outcome. Effectively detecting and localizing
such silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging
practice using metrics like training loss or gradient norm curves can be
inefficient and ineffective. Additionally, obtaining intermediate tensor values
and determining whether they are correct during silent bug localization is
difficult, particularly in the context of low-precision training.
  To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first system
capable of detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training. TTrace
collects intermediate tensors from distributing training in a fine-grained
manner and compares them against those from a trusted single-device reference
implementation. To properly compare the floating-point values in the tensors,
we propose novel mathematical analysis that provides a guideline for setting
thresholds, enabling TTrace to distinguish bug-induced errors from
floating-point round-off errors. Experimental results demonstrate that TTrace
effectively detects 11 existing bugs and 3 new bugs in the widely used
Megatron-LM framework, while requiring fewer than 10 lines of code change.
TTrace is effective in various training recipes, including low-precision
recipes involving BF16 and FP8.

*Dhruv Parikh,Viktor Prasanna*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: ScalableHD enhances HDC inference on multi-core CPUs with a two-stage pipelined model, achieving 10x speedup and robust scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional HDC methods suffer from low accuracy and lack efficient CPU inference solutions.

Method: ScalableHD uses a two-stage pipelined execution model, parallelized across cores, with memory tiling and NUMA-aware binding.

Result: Achieves 10x speedup over baselines, preserves accuracy, and scales near-proportionally with core count.

Conclusion: ScalableHD is a scalable, high-throughput solution for HDC inference on multi-core CPUs.

Abstract: Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a brain-inspired computing paradigm that
represents and manipulates information using high-dimensional vectors, called
hypervectors (HV). Traditional HDC methods, while robust to noise and
inherently parallel, rely on single-pass, non-parametric training and often
suffer from low accuracy. To address this, recent approaches adopt iterative
training of base and class HVs, typically accelerated on GPUs. Inference,
however, remains lightweight and well-suited for real-time execution. Yet,
efficient HDC inference has been studied almost exclusively on specialized
hardware such as FPGAs and GPUs, with limited attention to general-purpose
multi-core CPUs. To address this gap, we propose ScalableHD for scalable and
high-throughput HDC inference on multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD employs a
two-stage pipelined execution model, where each stage is parallelized across
cores and processes chunks of base and class HVs. Intermediate results are
streamed between stages using a producer-consumer mechanism, enabling
on-the-fly consumption and improving cache locality. To maximize performance,
ScalableHD integrates memory tiling and NUMA-aware worker-to-core binding.
Further, it features two execution variants tailored for small and large batch
sizes, each designed to exploit compute parallelism based on workload
characteristics while mitigating the memory-bound compute pattern that limits
HDC inference performance on modern multi-core CPUs. ScalableHD achieves up to
10x speedup in throughput (samples per second) over state-of-the-art baselines
such as TorchHD, across a diverse set of tasks ranging from human activity
recognition to image classification, while preserving task accuracy.
Furthermore, ScalableHD exhibits robust scalability: increasing the number of
cores yields near-proportional throughput improvements.

### [310] [Large Language Models for Design Structure Matrix Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09749)
*Shuo Jiang,Min Xie,Jianxi Luo*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize Design Structure Matrix (DSM) sequencing, achieving better results than traditional methods by combining contextual knowledge and mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods struggle with complex DSM interdependencies, prompting the use of LLMs for their advanced reasoning and contextual understanding.

Method: A novel LLM-based framework integrates network topology and domain knowledge for iterative DSM optimization.

Result: Experiments show faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to baselines, with contextual knowledge boosting performance.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a promising paradigm for solving complex engineering combinatorial optimization problems by blending semantic and mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or
development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure
Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and
enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging
combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations.
As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate,
traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often
fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective
solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for
advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based
framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for
iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem.
Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves
faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic
and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual
domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of
the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to
solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical
reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based
engineering design optimization.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0), a new paradigm powered by AI agents, reviewing its evolution and proposing a framework for end-to-end automation in engineering design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how Foundation Models (FMs) and multi-agent AI systems can transform engineering design by enhancing innovation, efficiency, and automation.

Method: Reviews historical stages of Intelligent Design, proposes a conceptual framework for ID 4.0, and discusses multi-agent collaboration for automation.

Result: ID 4.0 promises greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in tackling complex design challenges through AI-driven automation.

Conclusion: The paper lays a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design, highlighting future directions like complex scenarios, practical implementations, and better human-AI alignment.

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced
engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent
decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and
interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models
(FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general
knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for
further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper
introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by
agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four
distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning
models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of
multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and
discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design
processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems.
Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID
4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design
implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design
goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a
foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity,
autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design
challenges.

TL;DR: OpenAI's model o3 outperformed all students in a thermodynamics exam, solving all problems correctly in zero-shot mode, marking a milestone in AI capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate AI's ability to excel in complex, knowledge-based tasks traditionally reserved for humans, specifically in thermodynamics.

Method: The model o3 was given the same thermodynamics exam as students, assessed identically, in zero-shot mode.

Result: o3 solved all problems correctly, scoring better than all students and matching the best historical scores.

Conclusion: This marks a turning point for AI's role in tasks requiring deep understanding and creativity, impacting engineering education and practice.

Abstract: In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large
language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on
thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most
students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this
important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are
rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual
abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The
problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining
principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not
only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3,
and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the
students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better
than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the
best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is
a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of
human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the
work of engineers and the education of future engineers.

*Young-Jin Park,Kristjan Greenewald,Kaveh Alim,Hao Wang,Navid Azizan*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a calibration method for process reward models (PRMs) using quantile regression to improve alignment with true success probabilities. It also proposes an instance-adaptive scaling (IAS) framework to dynamically adjust inference budgets, reducing costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art PRMs are poorly calibrated and often overestimate success probabilities, leading to inefficient inference. Addressing this calibration issue can improve performance and reduce computational costs.

Method: The authors use quantile regression to calibrate PRM outputs and introduce an IAS framework that dynamically adjusts inference budgets based on calibrated success estimates and confidence bounds.

Result: Experiments show the calibration method achieves small calibration error, outperforming baselines. IAS reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy, adapting compute usage to problem confidence.

Conclusion: Calibration is crucial for effective adaptive scaling, and the IAS framework successfully reduces inference costs without compromising accuracy, making it a practical solution for LLM inference.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time
scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that
even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate
success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach,
performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align
with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates
and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive
scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on
the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a
correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number
of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each
instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method
successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline
methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling,
and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining
final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as
desired.

### [314] [Attention-Bayesian Hybrid Approach to Modular Multiple Particle Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09441)
*Piyush Mishra,Philippe Roudot*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A hybrid tracking framework combines transformer self-attention with Bayesian filtering to improve multiple-particle tracking in noisy, cluttered scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer architectures struggle to match Bayesian filtering's optimality in sparse scenarios, despite handling combinatorial explosion well.

Method: Uses a transformer encoder for soft associations to prune hypotheses, then applies Bayesian filtering for reliable tracking.

Result: Improved tracking accuracy and robustness against spurious detections in high-clutter scenarios.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods, offering a superior solution for complex particle tracking.

Abstract: Tracking multiple particles in noisy and cluttered scenes remains challenging
due to a combinatorial explosion of trajectory hypotheses, which scales
super-exponentially with the number of particles and frames. The transformer
architecture has shown a significant improvement in robustness against this
high combinatorial load. However, its performance still falls short of the
conventional Bayesian filtering approaches in scenarios presenting a reduced
set of trajectory hypothesis. This suggests that while transformers excel at
narrowing down possible associations, they may not be able to reach the
optimality of the Bayesian approach in locally sparse scenario. Hence, we
introduce a hybrid tracking framework that combines the ability of
self-attention to learn the underlying representation of particle behavior with
the reliability and interpretability of Bayesian filtering. We perform
trajectory-to-detection association by solving a label prediction problem,
using a transformer encoder to infer soft associations between detections
across frames. This prunes the hypothesis set, enabling efficient
multiple-particle tracking in Bayesian filtering framework. Our approach
demonstrates improved tracking accuracy and robustness against spurious
detections, offering a solution for high clutter multiple particle tracking
scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-CPI, an LLM-based method for forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) using high-frequency online text data, combining it with traditional low-frequency data for improved predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CPI forecasting methods rely on low-frequency survey data, leaving the potential of high-frequency online text data unexplored. This paper aims to leverage LLMs for better CPI predictions.

Method: The approach involves collecting high-frequency online texts, using LLMs (like ChatGPT and BERT) to generate inflation labels, extracting text embeddings (via LDA and BERT), and combining them with monthly CPI data in a joint time series framework (ARX for monthly, VARX for daily).

Result: The method demonstrates strong finite-sample performance and practical advantages through simulations and real data, with asymptotic properties and prediction intervals provided.

Conclusion: LLM-CPI effectively integrates high-frequency online text data with traditional CPI data, offering improved forecasting accuracy and practical utility.

Abstract: Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging
task in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency,
survey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs),
there is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for
improved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes
LLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating
online text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts
from a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as
ChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels
for posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted
via LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines
monthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model
employs an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and
macroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on
LLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic
properties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction
intervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI
are demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The susceptibility of Bayesian predictive models to adversarial attacks is underexplored, unlike classical setups.

Method: Proposes gradient-based attacks for perturbing point predictions and altering posterior predictive distributions.

Result: Novel attacks are studied for their implementation and properties in various computational setups.

Conclusion: The work advances adversarial machine learning by addressing gaps in Bayesian model vulnerabilities.

Abstract: There is an increasing interest in analyzing the behavior of machine learning
systems against adversarial attacks. However, most of the research in
adversarial machine learning has focused on studying weaknesses against evasion
or poisoning attacks to predictive models in classical setups, with the
susceptibility of Bayesian predictive models to attacks remaining
underexplored. This paper introduces a general methodology for designing
optimal evasion attacks against such models. We investigate two adversarial
objectives: perturbing specific point predictions and altering the entire
posterior predictive distribution. For both scenarios, we propose novel
gradient-based attacks and study their implementation and properties in various
computational setups.

*Mattia Rosso,Simone Rossi,Giulio Franzese,Markus Heinonen,Maurizio Filippone*

TL;DR: The paper explores scaling laws for predictive uncertainties in deep learning, showing they exist for both in- and out-of-distribution uncertainties, even in over-parameterized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if scaling laws, known for model performance, also apply to predictive uncertainties in deep learning, addressing skepticism about the need for Bayesian methods in data-rich scenarios.

Method: Empirical analysis of scaling laws for predictive uncertainties using approximate Bayesian inference and ensemble methods on vision and language tasks.

Result: Scaling laws for predictive uncertainties are observed, indicating that even large datasets may not render epistemic uncertainty negligible.

Conclusion: The work provides evidence for the relevance of Bayesian approaches in deep learning, as epistemic uncertainty remains significant despite large datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has recently revealed the existence of scaling laws,
demonstrating that model performance follows predictable trends based on
dataset and model sizes. Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena
emerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do
similar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In
identifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a
straightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this
case, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic
uncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in
over-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely
unexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of
scaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with
respect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language
tasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive
uncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and
ensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical
utility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work
provides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian
approaches: "In many applications of deep learning we have so much data
available: what do we need Bayes for?". Our findings show that "so much data"
is typically not enough to make epistemic uncertainty negligible.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: DDPMs show robustness to noise in score evaluations and achieve faster convergence rates, matching optimal Gaussian case rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of DDPMs to noise in score evaluations and improve convergence guarantees.

Method: Empirical analysis and theoretical finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance.

Result: DDPMs are robust to noise, achieve faster convergence rates, and match optimal Gaussian case rates.

Conclusion: DDPMs are robust and efficient, with convergence rates confirming their optimality.

Abstract: Generative modeling aims to produce new random examples from an unknown
target distribution, given access to a finite collection of examples. Among the
leading approaches, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) construct
such examples by mapping a Brownian motion via a diffusion process driven by an
estimated score function. In this work, we first provide empirical evidence
that DDPMs are robust to constant-variance noise in the score evaluations. We
then establish finite-sample guarantees in Wasserstein-2 distance that exhibit
two key features: (i) they characterize and quantify the robustness of DDPMs to

*Dany Lauzon,Julien Straubhaar,Philippe Renard*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel deep learning approach using graph generative models (GraphRNN and G-DDPM) to simulate complex karst networks, validated with real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of karst networks and their physicochemical processes makes simulation challenging, requiring methods that capture intricate patterns and hydrogeological conditions.

Method: Combines GraphRNN for topological distribution and G-DDPM for node features, generating realistic karst networks.

Result: Validated with real-world data, the method produces realistic simulations useful for studying flow and transport processes.

Conclusion: The approach enables stochastic simulation of karst networks, aiding in understanding their behavior across various formations.

Abstract: The simulation of discrete karst networks presents a significant challenge
due to the complexity of the physicochemical processes occurring within various
geological and hydrogeological contexts over extended periods. This complex
interplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately
linked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that
represents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep
learning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In
this representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while
edges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two
main steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to
learn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the
graph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by
previously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion
probabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial
coordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes
features on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned
statistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,
ensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential
features of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst
networks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the
database, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows
stochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of
formations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such
as flow and transport.

TL;DR: The study uses LSTM and GBC models to forecast USD/BDT exchange rates, achieving high accuracy with LSTM (99.449%) but mixed results in profitability with GBC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate forex prediction is crucial for trade, investments, and economic stability.

Method: LSTM for rate forecasting and GBC for directional prediction, using historical data (2018-2023).

Result: LSTM outperforms ARIMA (RMSE 0.9858 vs. 1.342); GBC yields 40.82% profitable trades but net loss.

Conclusion: Deep learning shows promise for forex forecasting; future work could include sentiment analysis and real-time data.

Abstract: The prediction of foreign exchange rates, such as the US Dollar (USD) to
Bangladeshi Taka (BDT), plays a pivotal role in global financial markets,
influencing trade, investments, and economic stability. This study leverages
historical USD/BDT exchange rate data from 2018 to 2023, sourced from Yahoo
Finance, to develop advanced machine learning models for accurate forecasting.
A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is employed, achieving an
exceptional accuracy of 99.449%, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.9858, and
a test loss of 0.8523, significantly outperforming traditional methods like
ARIMA (RMSE 1.342). Additionally, a Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is
applied for directional prediction, with backtesting on a $10,000 initial
capital revealing a 40.82% profitable trade rate, though resulting in a net
loss of $20,653.25 over 49 trades. The study analyzes historical trends,
showing a decline in BDT/USD rates from 0.012 to 0.009, and incorporates
normalized daily returns to capture volatility. These findings highlight the
potential of deep learning in forex forecasting, offering traders and
policymakers robust tools to mitigate risks. Future work could integrate
sentiment analysis and real-time economic indicators to further enhance model
adaptability in volatile markets.

TL;DR: Novel null models for binary transactional/sequence datasets, preserving more properties like the Bipartite Joint Degree Matrix, with a fast-sampling algorithm (Alice).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve statistical hypothesis testing for binary datasets by preserving more dataset properties than existing null models.

Method: Developed null models preserving the Bipartite Joint Degree Matrix and introduced Alice, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling.

Result: Alice mixes fast, scales well, and identifies different significant results compared to prior models.

Conclusion: The proposed null models and Alice algorithm offer improved accuracy and efficiency for dataset analysis.

Abstract: We introduce novel null models for assessing the results obtained from
observed binary transactional and sequence datasets, using statistical
hypothesis testing. Our null models maintain more properties of the observed
dataset than existing ones. Specifically, they preserve the Bipartite Joint
Degree Matrix of the bipartite (multi-)graph corresponding to the dataset,
which ensures that the number of caterpillars, i.e., paths of length three, is
preserved, in addition to other properties considered by other models. We
describe Alice, a suite of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for sampling
datasets from our null models, based on a carefully defined set of states and
efficient operations to move between them. The results of our experimental
evaluation show that Alice mixes fast and scales well, and that our null model
finds different significant results than ones previously considered in the
literature.

Result: SimClass closely approximates real classroom speech, proving useful for robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

Conclusion: SimClass provides a valuable resource for advancing AI-driven speech models in educational settings.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the
development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets
remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the
use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom

methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized
classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech
data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube
lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.
Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely
approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for
developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

TL;DR: The paper integrates contextual biasing (CB) with Open Whisper-Style Speech Models (OWSM) to improve recognition of rare words without retraining, achieving better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFMs like OWSM struggle with rare/unseen words, and existing CB methods lack pre-trained knowledge, leading to lower performance.

Method: Combines an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its pre-trained parameters to leverage embedded knowledge.

Result: Improves biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points and overall WER by 0.9 points, with a 7.5% reduction in real-time factor.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances rare word recognition while maintaining SFM advantages, even with limited data.

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs), such as Open Whisper-Style Speech Models
(OWSM), are trained on massive datasets to achieve accurate automatic speech
recognition. However, even SFMs struggle to accurately recognize rare and
unseen words. While contextual biasing (CB) is a promising approach to improve
recognition of such words, most CB methods are trained from scratch, resulting
in lower performance than SFMs due to the lack of pre-trained knowledge. This
paper integrates an existing CB method with OWSM v3.1 while freezing its
pre-trained parameters. By leveraging the knowledge embedded in SFMs, the
proposed method enables effective CB while preserving the advantages of SFMs,
even with a small dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method
improves the biasing word error rate (B-WER) by 11.6 points, resulting in a 0.9
point improvement in the overall WER while reducing the real-time factor by
7.5% compared to the non-biasing baseline on the LibriSpeech 100 test-clean
set.

Result: Evaluated using objective (FAD, SSIM, PLCC, MCD) and subjective (MOS, SMOS) metrics, showing improved performance.

Conclusion: BemaGANv2 advances audio generation with novel architectures, and the paper provides a tutorial for reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of
BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and
long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture,
BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional
ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition
(AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better
model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the
Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally
proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity
detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this
combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio.
We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD
+ MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM,
PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores using pre-trained speech-language and language models (PSLMs/PLMs) to enhance audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) by incorporating linguistic constraints, improving speech quality and intelligibility without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use linguistic knowledge (e.g., syntax, semantics) for speech perception, inspiring the integration of PSLMs/PLMs into AV-TSE to leverage linguistic constraints.

Method: Proposes adding linguistic constraints from PSLMs/PLMs as auxiliary supervision signals for AV-TSE models.

Result: Consistent improvements in speech quality and intelligibility, with robust performance in multi-language and visual cue-impaired scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating linguistic constraints from PSLMs/PLMs enhances AV-TSE effectively and efficiently.

Abstract: Audio-visual target speaker extraction (AV-TSE) models primarily rely on
target visual cues to isolate the target speaker's voice from others. We know
that humans leverage linguistic knowledge, such as syntax and semantics, to
support speech perception. Inspired by this, we explore the potential of
pre-trained speech-language models (PSLMs) and pre-trained language models
(PLMs) as auxiliary knowledge sources for AV-TSE. In this study, we propose
incorporating the linguistic constraints from PSLMs or PLMs for the AV-TSE
model as additional supervision signals. Without introducing any extra
computational cost during inference, the proposed approach consistently
improves speech quality and intelligibility. Furthermore, we evaluate our
method in multi-language settings and visual cue-impaired scenarios and show
robust performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integrating speech with complex background environments is challenging, and existing TTS models lack this capability.

Method: Flow-matching based TTS model jointly generates speech and environmental audio, using self-supervised learning to handle unannotated data.

Result: Outperforms baselines, producing natural, high-quality, context-aware audio.

Conclusion: UmbraTTS effectively combines speech and background audio, demonstrating superior performance and control.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have enabled highly natural speech
synthesis, yet integrating speech with complex background environments remains
challenging. We introduce UmbraTTS, a flow-matching based TTS model that
jointly generates both speech and environmental audio, conditioned on text and
acoustic context. Our model allows fine-grained control over background volume
and produces diverse, coherent, and context-aware audio scenes. A key challenge
is the lack of data with speech and background audio aligned in natural
context. To overcome the lack of paired training data, we propose a
self-supervised framework that extracts speech, background audio, and
transcripts from unannotated recordings. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
UmbraTTS significantly outperformed existing baselines, producing natural,
high-quality, environmentally aware audios.

TL;DR: CryoSPIRE introduces a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model for 3D reconstruction in cryo-EM, handling conformational and compositional variability, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in cryo-EM, such as non-rigid flexibility and missing parts in imaged particles, to improve 3D molecular structure inference.

Method: Uses a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model with part-based segmentation to handle variability, inspired by Gaussian Splatting.

Result: Demonstrates biologically meaningful structures on complex datasets and sets a new benchmark in CryoBench.

Conclusion: CryoSPIRE advances cryo-EM by effectively modeling variability and improving reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Cryo-EM is a transformational paradigm in molecular biology where
computational methods are used to infer 3D molecular structure at atomic
resolution from extremely noisy 2D electron microscope images. At the forefront
of research is how to model the structure when the imaged particles exhibit
non-rigid conformational flexibility and compositional variation where parts
are sometimes missing. We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a
hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for
4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded
in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle,
providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and
compositional variability. The framework, called CryoSPIRE, is shown to reveal
biologically meaningful structures on complex experimental datasets, and
establishes a new state-of-the-art on CryoBench, a benchmark for cryo-EM
heterogeneity methods.

*Rémi Vaucher,Stéphane Chrétien*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper explores using Signature theory and continuous time Markov modeling to detect aggressive cancers via ctDNA dynamics in blood samples, addressing data scarcity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve early multi-cancer detection by leveraging ctDNA dynamics and overcoming limitations of sparse blood sample data.

Method: Combines continuous time Markov modeling for ctDNA dynamics with Signature theory for feature extraction and efficient testing.

Result: The proposed method effectively handles data scarcity and is validated through extensive numerical experiments.

Conclusion: Signature theory and Markov modeling provide a promising pipeline for aggressive cancer detection using ctDNA analysis.

Abstract: Recent discoveries have suggested that the promising avenue of using
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in blood samples provides reasonable
accuracy for cancer monitoring, with extremely low burden on the patient's
side. It is known that the presence of ctDNA can result from various mechanisms
leading to DNA release from cells, such as apoptosis, necrosis or active
secretion. One key idea in recent cancer monitoring studies is that monitoring
the dynamics of ctDNA levels might be sufficient for early multi-cancer
detection. This interesting idea has been turned into commercial products, e.g.
in the company named GRAIL.
  In the present work, we propose to explore the use of Signature theory for
detecting aggressive cancer tumors based on the analysis of blood samples. Our
approach combines tools from continuous time Markov modelling for the dynamics
of ctDNA levels in the blood, with Signature theory for building efficient
testing procedures. Signature theory is a topic of growing interest in the
Machine Learning community (see Chevyrev2016 and Fermanian2021), which is now
recognised as a powerful feature extraction tool for irregularly sampled
signals. The method proposed in the present paper is shown to correctly address
the challenging problem of overcoming the inherent data scarsity due to the
extremely small number of blood samples per patient. The relevance of our
approach is illustrated with extensive numerical experiments that confirm the
efficiency of the proposed pipeline.

Motivation: To explore how FMs are revolutionizing medical image analysis by reducing reliance on manual annotations and improving adaptability to diverse clinical tasks.

Method: Review of over 150 studies, analyzing FM pipelines, architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and downstream adaptation strategies across medical imaging domains.

Result: FMs show promise in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, with adaptable features and reduced need for labeled data. Design choices vary by application.

Conclusion: FMs are advancing medical imaging but face challenges; future research should address these to unlock their full potential.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by

manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose
visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with
little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being
developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on
evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines,
including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LoREIN is an unsupervised, dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI reconstruction, combining low-rank and continuity priors for high-fidelity results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction methods for MP-qMRI rely on single priors or physics-informed models, leading to suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of the problem.

Method: LoREIN integrates low-rank prior (via LRR) and continuity prior (via INR) to enhance reconstruction fidelity, leveraging INR for optimal spatial bases and multi-contrast guidance.

Result: The framework achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of weighted images and quantitative parameter maps, outperforming single-prior methods.

Conclusion: LoREIN advances MP-qMRI reconstruction and introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broader applications in medical imaging.

Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) provides tissue-specific
parameters vital for clinical diagnosis. Although simultaneous multi-parametric
qMRI (MP-qMRI) technologies enhance imaging efficiency, robustly reconstructing
qMRI from highly undersampled, high-dimensional measurements remains a
significant challenge. This difficulty arises primarily because current
reconstruction methods that rely solely on a single prior or physics-informed
model to solve the highly ill-posed inverse problem, which often leads to
suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose LoREIN, a novel
unsupervised and dual-prior-integrated framework for accelerated 3D MP-qMRI
reconstruction. Technically, LoREIN incorporates both low-rank prior and
continuity prior via low-rank representation (LRR) and implicit neural
representation (INR), respectively, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. The
powerful continuous representation of INR enables the estimation of optimal
spatial bases within the low-rank subspace, facilitating high-fidelity
reconstruction of weighted images. Simultaneously, the predicted multi-contrast
weighted images provide essential structural and quantitative guidance, further
enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of quantitative parameter maps.
Furthermore, our work introduces a zero-shot learning paradigm with broad
potential in complex spatiotemporal and high-dimensional image reconstruction
tasks, further advancing the field of medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a large, multicenter oral cytology dataset to improve AI-driven early detection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), addressing challenges in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of OSCC improves survival rates, but traditional histopathology is invasive and resource-intensive. Oral cytology offers a less invasive alternative, but variability and lack of experts hinder its effectiveness.

Method: The authors created a labeled, multicenter dataset of oral cytology slides (PAP and MGG stains) from ten Indian medical centers, annotated by expert pathologists for AI training.

Result: The dataset fills a gap in publicly available resources, enabling robust AI models for automated OSCC detection, reducing diagnostic errors, and improving early diagnosis.

Conclusion: This dataset aims to enhance AI-driven diagnostics, improve early OSCC detection in resource-limited areas, and ultimately reduce mortality and improve patient outcomes globally.

Abstract: Oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC is a major global health burden,
particularly in several regions across Asia, Africa, and South America, where
it accounts for a significant proportion of cancer cases. Early detection
dramatically improves outcomes, with stage I cancers achieving up to 90 percent
survival. However, traditional diagnosis based on histopathology has limited
accessibility in low-resource settings because it is invasive,
resource-intensive, and reliant on expert pathologists. On the other hand, oral
cytology of brush biopsy offers a minimally invasive and lower cost
alternative, provided that the remaining challenges, inter observer variability
and unavailability of expert pathologists can be addressed using artificial
intelligence. Development and validation of robust AI solutions requires access
to large, labeled, and multi-source datasets to train high capacity models that
generalize across domain shifts. We introduce the first large and multicenter
oral cytology dataset, comprising annotated slides stained with
Papanicolaou(PAP) and May-Grunwald-Giemsa(MGG) protocols, collected from ten
tertiary medical centers in India. The dataset is labeled and annotated by
expert pathologists for cellular anomaly classification and detection, is
designed to advance AI driven diagnostic methods. By filling the gap in
publicly available oral cytology datasets, this resource aims to enhance
automated detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and improve early OSCC diagnosis
in resource-constrained settings, ultimately contributing to reduced mortality
and better patient outcomes worldwide.

### [336] [Sampling Theory for Super-Resolution with Implicit Neural Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09949)
*Mahrokh Najaf,Gregory Ongie*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper studies the sample complexity of estimating images using implicit neural representations (INRs) in linear inverse problems, focusing on recovery from low-pass Fourier samples. It identifies sufficient conditions for exact recovery and validates the theory empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs are powerful for inverse problems, but their sample complexity is not well understood. This work aims to bridge this gap by analyzing recovery conditions for INR-based image estimation.

Method: The study uses a single hidden-layer INR with ReLU activation and Fourier features, employing generalized weight decay regularization. It links non-convex optimization to convex penalties in infinite-dimensional spaces.

Result: The paper identifies sufficient Fourier samples for exact INR-based image recovery and validates the theory through empirical tests, including super-resolution recovery of phantom images.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical and empirical insights into the sample complexity of INRs for image recovery, demonstrating their potential in solving linear inverse problems.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful tool for
solving inverse problems in computer vision and computational imaging. INRs
represent images as continuous domain functions realized by a neural network
taking spatial coordinates as inputs. However, unlike traditional pixel
representations, little is known about the sample complexity of estimating
images using INRs in the context of linear inverse problems. Towards this end,
we study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image
from its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with
ReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight
decay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this
non-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex
penalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a
sufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is
exactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem. To validate our
theory, we empirically assess the probability of achieving exact recovery of
images realized by low-width single hidden-layer INRs, and illustrate the
performance of INRs on super-resolution recovery of continuous domain phantom
images.

*Yihe Tang,Wenlong Huang,Yingke Wang,Chengshu Li,Roy Yuan,Ruohan Zhang,Jiajun Wu,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation) distills affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without manual annotations, enabling generalization to diverse robotic and human scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for visual affordance predictions rely on manual annotations or predefined tasks, limiting adaptability.

Method: UAD leverages large vision and vision-language models to auto-annotate a dataset with instruction-affordance pairs, training a lightweight decoder on frozen features.

Result: UAD generalizes well to real-world robotic scenes and human activities, despite training on simulated data. An imitation learning policy using UAD's affordance shows strong generalization with minimal demonstrations.

Conclusion: UAD offers a scalable, annotation-free approach to affordance learning, enhancing robotic manipulation in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to
manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task
instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often
rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of
tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for
distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned
affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD
automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction,
visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned
decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to
in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being
trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as
the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates
promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and
even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10
demonstrations. Project website: https://unsup-affordance.github.io/

TL;DR: A hierarchical control pipeline simulates human balance using a musculoskeletal system, revealing insights into static balance, muscle injury effects, and fall patterns. Hip exoskeleton assistance improves balance and reduces muscle effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited quantitative understanding of static balance and falling, and to provide muscle-level insights for balance impairments and robotic systems.

Method: A hierarchical control pipeline applied to a whole-body musculoskeletal system, simulating balance, muscle injury effects, and fall patterns. Hip exoskeleton assistance was also tested.

Result: Identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing, effects of muscle injury, and fall patterns matching clinical data. Hip exoskeleton improved balance and reduced muscle effort.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable muscle-level insights into balance dynamics, aiding interventions for balance impairments and advancing humanoid robotics.

Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While
dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention,
quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This
work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via
a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal
dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle
injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned
with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance
demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under
perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance
dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a
foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance
impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.

### [339] [Adv-BMT: Bidirectional Motion Transformer for Safety-Critical Traffic Scenario Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09485)
*Yuxin Liu,Zhenghao Peng,Xuanhao Cui,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes Adv-BMT, a framework to generate diverse and realistic adversarial scenarios for autonomous driving testing by augmenting real-world data with inverse traffic motion predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios, limiting the validation of autonomous driving systems.

Method: Adv-BMT uses a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) for inverse traffic motion predictions and a two-staged pipeline: adversarial initializations followed by inverse motion predictions.

Result: The framework generates realistic collision scenarios without pretraining on collision data, reducing episode collision rates by 20% in experiments.

Conclusion: Adv-BMT effectively enhances scenario-based testing for autonomous driving by addressing data scarcity and improving safety-critical scenario generation.

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of
autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the
scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets
collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT
framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic
adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional
motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,
which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,
and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the
initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first
conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.
Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for
pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision
interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated
collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce
episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

*Taku Okawara,Kenji Koide,Aoki Takanose,Shuji Oishi,Masashi Yokozuka,Kentaro Uno,Kazuya Yoshida*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robust LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry method using an online learning-based neural leg kinematics model, adaptable to featureless environments and deformable terrains, outperforming state-of-the-art works.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in featureless environments and deformable terrains for odometry estimation in robots.

Method: Developed a neural leg kinematics model incorporating tactile feedback, trained online alongside odometry estimation on a unified factor graph.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in real-world experiments on challenging terrains like sandy beaches and mixed campus environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances odometry robustness in difficult conditions, validated by successful real-world testing.

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is
robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and
deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model
named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information
(foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between
robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its
adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or
transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural
adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg
kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of
this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to
retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real
experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy
beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,
and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of
asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed
that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics
model} outperforms state-of-the-art works. Our project page is available for

*Yangjie Cui,Boyang Gao,Yiwei Zhang,Xin Dong,Jinwu Xiang,Daochun Li,Zhan Tu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes WD-DETR, a wavelet denoising-enhanced detection transformer for event cameras, addressing noise in dense event representations to improve detection performance and real-time processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense event representations for event cameras suffer from accumulated noise, degrading detection quality and causing missed detections.

Method: The method involves dense event representation, wavelet transform for noise filtering, transformer-based object prediction, and Dynamic Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) for faster inference.

Result: WD-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx datasets and achieves ~35 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX.

Conclusion: WD-DETR effectively addresses noise in event representations, enhancing detection performance and real-time suitability for robotic systems.

Abstract: Previous studies on event camera sensing have demonstrated certain detection
performance using dense event representations. However, the accumulated noise
in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which
degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed
detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet
Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event
cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which
enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet
transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such
a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted
features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object
prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic
Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid
encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object
detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that
WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement
our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin
NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16,
which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic
systems.

### [342] [Perception Characteristics Distance: Measuring Stability and Robustness of Perception System in Dynamic Conditions under a Certain Decision Rule](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09217)
*Boyu Jiang,Liang Shi,Zhengzhi Lin,Loren Stowe,Feng Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD), a dynamic metric for evaluating perception systems in autonomous driving, and the SensorRainFall dataset for benchmarking under varying conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for perception systems are static and fail to account for variability in detection confidence due to factors like distance and weather.

Method: Developed PCD to quantify reliable detection distance, using the SensorRainFall dataset collected under controlled conditions (daylight-clear and daylight-rain).

Result: Statistical analysis identified change points in detection confidence variance with distance. mPCD (mean PCD) effectively captured reliability differences under varying weather.

Conclusion: PCD offers a principled, distribution-aware performance measure, enhancing ADS robustness, while SensorRainFall provides a benchmark for future evaluations.

Abstract: The performance of perception systems in autonomous driving systems (ADS) is
strongly influenced by object distance, scene dynamics, and environmental
conditions such as weather. AI-based perception outputs are inherently
stochastic, with variability driven by these external factors, while
traditional evaluation metrics remain static and event-independent, failing to
capture fluctuations in confidence over time. In this work, we introduce the
Perception Characteristics Distance (PCD) -- a novel evaluation metric that
quantifies the farthest distance at which an object can be reliably detected,
incorporating uncertainty in model outputs. To support this, we present the
SensorRainFall dataset, collected on the Virginia Smart Road using a
sensor-equipped vehicle (cameras, radar, LiDAR) under controlled daylight-clear
and daylight-rain scenarios, with precise ground-truth distances to the target
objects. Statistical analysis reveals the presence of change points in the
variance of detection confidence score with distance. By averaging the PCD
values across a range of detection quality thresholds and probabilistic
thresholds, we compute the mean PCD (mPCD), which captures the overall
perception characteristics of a system with respect to detection distance.
Applying state-of-the-art perception models shows that mPCD captures meaningful
reliability differences under varying weather conditions -- differences that
static metrics overlook. PCD provides a principled, distribution-aware measure
of perception performance, supporting safer and more robust ADS operation,
while the SensorRainFall dataset offers a valuable benchmark for evaluation.
The SensorRainFall dataset is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DCIRNet, a multimodal depth completion network, improves depth estimation for transparent and reflective objects by fusing RGB and depth data, enhancing grasp success rates by 44%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent and reflective objects challenge depth sensors due to specular reflections and light transmission, leading to inaccurate depth estimates that hinder vision tasks.

Method: DCIRNet integrates RGB images and depth maps with a multimodal feature fusion module and multi-stage supervision for refined depth completion.

Result: The model achieves a 44% improvement in grasp success rates and outperforms on public datasets, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: DCIRNet effectively addresses depth estimation issues for transparent and reflective objects, validated by experiments and practical applications.

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects in everyday environments pose significant
challenges for depth sensors due to their unique visual properties, such as
specular reflections and light transmission. These characteristics often lead
to incomplete or inaccurate depth estimation, which severely impacts downstream
geometry-based vision tasks, including object recognition, scene
reconstruction, and robotic manipulation. To address the issue of missing depth
information in transparent and reflective objects, we propose DCIRNet, a novel
multimodal depth completion network that effectively integrates RGB images and
depth maps to enhance depth estimation quality. Our approach incorporates an
innovative multimodal feature fusion module designed to extract complementary
information between RGB images and incomplete depth maps. Furthermore, we
introduce a multi-stage supervision and depth refinement strategy that
progressively improves depth completion and effectively mitigates the issue of
blurred object boundaries. We integrate our depth completion model into
dexterous grasping frameworks and achieve a $44\%$ improvement in the grasp
success rate for transparent and reflective objects. We conduct extensive
experiments on public datasets, where DCIRNet demonstrates superior
performance. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our
approach and confirm its strong generalization capability across various
transparent and reflective objects.

TL;DR: SkillBlender is a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for versatile humanoid loco-manipulation, blending pretrained primitive skills to reduce task-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for humanoid control require tedious task-specific tuning, limiting versatility and scalability.

Method: SkillBlender pretrains task-agnostic primitive skills and dynamically blends them for complex tasks with minimal reward engineering.

Result: Outperforms baselines, avoids reward hacking, and achieves accurate, feasible movements.

Conclusion: SkillBlender offers a scalable, versatile solution for humanoid loco-manipulation, with open-sourced code and benchmark.

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold significant potential in accomplishing daily tasks
across diverse environments thanks to their flexibility and human-like
morphology. Recent works have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body
control and loco-manipulation leveraging optimal control or reinforcement
learning. However, these methods require tedious task-specific tuning for each
task to achieve satisfactory behaviors, limiting their versatility and
scalability to diverse tasks in daily scenarios. To that end, we introduce
SkillBlender, a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for
versatile humanoid loco-manipulation. SkillBlender first pretrains
goal-conditioned task-agnostic primitive skills, and then dynamically blends
these skills to accomplish complex loco-manipulation tasks with minimal
task-specific reward engineering. We also introduce SkillBench, a parallel,
cross-embodiment, and diverse simulated benchmark containing three embodiments,
four primitive skills, and eight challenging loco-manipulation tasks,
accompanied by a set of scientific evaluation metrics balancing accuracy and
feasibility. Extensive simulated experiments show that our method significantly
outperforms all baselines, while naturally regularizing behaviors to avoid
reward hacking, resulting in more accurate and feasible movements for diverse
loco-manipulation tasks in our daily scenarios. Our code and benchmark will be
open-sourced to the community to facilitate future research. Project page:

*Irving Fang,Juexiao Zhang,Shengbang Tong,Chen Feng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces a simulation-based task suite to evaluate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, revealing gaps between perceptual understanding and precise motor execution, and releases the suite as a benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of VLAs are insufficient, lacking language integration and standardized benchmarks, hindering reproducibility and understanding of VLM contributions.

Method: A unified suite of 50 simulation tasks across 10 subcategories is introduced to systematically evaluate VLA architectures.

Result: VLAs show robust perceptual understanding but falter in precise motor execution, and finetuning can degrade VLM reasoning.

Conclusion: The task suite serves as a benchmark to address the perception-to-action gap in VLAs, promoting future research.

Abstract: One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional
imitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization
capabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,
"generalist" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain
insufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to
the lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that
incorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend
to investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization
capabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies
on real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,
which creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this
gap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across
10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We
systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this
suite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that
while VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high
level planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably
translate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution
observations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action
execution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's
generalist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code
to serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on
closing the perception-to-action gap. More information, including the source
code, can be found at https://ai4ce.github.io/INT-ACT/

TL;DR: A method for tracking steerable catheters in cerebral vasculature using custom radiopaque markers to enable shape and pose estimation under biplane fluoroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for catheter tracking are limited to planar segmentation or bulky sensors, which are unsuitable for microcatheters used in neurointervention.

Method: Equipping catheters with custom radiopaque markers arranged to minimize sensitivity to tracking uncertainty, enabling shape and pose estimation.

Result: Successful deployment in microcatheters (<2mm OD) with shape tracking errors <1mm and roll errors <40 degrees.

Conclusion: This approach enables autonomous navigation of steerable catheters under biplane imaging.

Abstract: Safe navigation of steerable and robotic catheters in the cerebral
vasculature requires awareness of the catheters shape and pose. Currently, a
significant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally
reconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images.
Efforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky
sensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in
neurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque
markers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane
fluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these
markers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach
was deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom
vasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors
below 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously
navigate under biplane imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend quadruped robots' capabilities beyond locomotion to dynamic object manipulation without additional actuators.

Method: Hierarchical policy structure with expert policies for scooping/tossing and approaching objects, plus a meta-policy for coordination.

Result: Demonstrates effective dynamic object collection using legs, expanding their utility.

Conclusion: Quadruped legs can be repurposed for dynamic manipulation, enhancing their versatility.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have made significant advances in locomotion, extending
their capabilities from controlled environments to real-world applications.
Beyond movement, recent work has explored loco-manipulation using the legs to
perform tasks such as pressing buttons or opening doors. While these efforts
demonstrate the feasibility of leg-based manipulation, most have focused on
relatively static tasks. In this work, we propose a framework that enables
quadruped robots to collect objects without additional actuators by leveraging
the agility of their legs. By attaching a simple scoop-like add-on to one leg,
the robot can scoop objects and toss them into a collection tray mounted on its
back. Our method employs a hierarchical policy structure comprising two expert
policies-one for scooping and tossing, and one for approaching object
positions-and a meta-policy that dynamically switches between them. The expert
policies are trained separately, followed by meta-policy training for
coordinated multi-object collection. This approach demonstrates how quadruped
legs can be effectively utilized for dynamic object manipulation, expanding
their role beyond locomotion.

Result: TUDP achieves state-of-the-art success rates (82.6% multi-view, 83.8% single-view) and performs well with fewer iterations.

Conclusion: TUDP efficiently and accurately generates robotic actions, outperforming existing methods in speed and success rates.

Abstract: In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models
to estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion
model has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs
well in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,
the diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to
iteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic
manipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action
denoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model
training and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions
efficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy
(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified
denoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in
action space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all
timesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of
policy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose
an action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination
branch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through
action-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern
successful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6%
on a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when
using fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement
in success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide
range of real-world tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Chain-of-Action (CoA) is a visuo-motor policy paradigm using backward reasoning for trajectory generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in RLBench and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trajectory generation by enforcing global-to-local action constraints through backward reasoning, unlike conventional forward-prediction methods.

Method: CoA uses backward reasoning with task-specific goals, unified in an autoregressive structure with keyframe actions and complementary designs like continuous action tokens and dynamic stopping.

Result: CoA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: CoA's backward reasoning and global-to-local structure enhance spatial generalization while maintaining policy flexibility, proving effective in diverse tasks.

Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built
upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that
predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by
explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single
autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe
action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens
are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and
previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a
global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained
by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA
incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token
representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;
reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk
modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial
generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of
a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.

*Qiao Gu,Yuanliang Ju,Shengxiang Sun,Igor Gilitschenski,Haruki Nishimura,Masha Itkina,Florian Shkurti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SAFE is a failure detector for generalist robot policies like VLAs, trained on VLA internal features to predict task failure likelihood, achieving state-of-the-art performance on unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs show limited success on novel tasks, requiring a failure detector that generalizes across unseen tasks and environments.

Method: Analyzes VLA feature space, trains SAFE on successful and failed rollouts to predict failure likelihood, and evaluates on unseen tasks.

Result: SAFE outperforms baselines in accuracy and detection time, compatible with various policy architectures.

Conclusion: SAFE provides a robust, generalizable solution for failure detection in VLAs, enhancing their safety and reliability.

Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic
behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited
success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these
policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector
that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for
help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or
a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect
failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we
introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure
detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature
space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task
success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this
insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a
single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on
both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is
compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$,
and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We
compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves
state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between
accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction. More qualitative
results can be found at https://vla-safe.github.io/.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: eFlesh is a low-cost, customizable magnetic tactile sensor for robots, enabling precise force sensing and manipulation in unstructured environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of versatile, accessible tactile sensors in robotics has led to fragmented or force-unaware solutions, hindering effective physical interaction in unstructured settings.

Method: eFlesh uses 3D-printed, magnet-based microstructures and a magnetometer circuit board, with an open-source design tool for customization.

Result: Achieves 0.5 mm contact localization RMSE, 0.27 N normal force RMSE, 95% slip detection accuracy, and 40% manipulation improvement over vision-only baselines.

Conclusion: eFlesh bridges the tactile sensing gap, offering a practical, open-source solution for precise robotic manipulation.

Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured
environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces
during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and
easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific
solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,
sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a
magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly
customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a
hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired
shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,
parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and
its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts
convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular
design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to
adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization
experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE
of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for
shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to
unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that
improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving
91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy
for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL
conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an ML-based framework to optimize pick success in warehouse automation, reducing failure rates by 20% compared to heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance operational efficiency and resilience in warehouse automation by improving pick success rates using data-driven approaches.

Method: ML framework predicting transform adjustments and suction cup selection for multi-suction end effectors.

Result: 20% reduction in pick failure rates in large-scale evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves pick success in warehouse automation, outperforming heuristic baselines.

Abstract: Warehouse automation plays a pivotal role in enhancing operational
efficiency, minimizing costs, and improving resilience to workforce
variability. While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine
learning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic
fleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts
primarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using
heuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging
data-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better
performance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that
predicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction
cups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success
probabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells
that resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet,
which is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the
proposed method achieves a 20\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a
heuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in
large-scale warehouse automation scenarios.

*Yizhak Yisrael Elboher,Omri Isac,Guy Katz,Tobias Ladner,Haoze Wu*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: A framework for proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification is introduced to bridge the gap between scalability and provable guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current proof-producing verifiers lack support for abstraction-based reasoning, limiting scalability and reliability in DNN verification.

Method: The approach modularly splits verification into proving abstract network correctness and abstraction soundness, leveraging existing tools for the former and introducing a new method for the latter.

Result: The framework enables scalable and trustworthy DNN verification by integrating abstraction techniques with formal proofs.

Conclusion: This work advances DNN verification by combining scalability through abstraction with formal proof guarantees.

Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely
on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof
production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of
DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not
support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and
provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for
proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly
separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the
correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the
abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by
existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for
generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable
scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction
techniques within a formal proof framework.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an online optimization framework for integrated TN-NTN networks using MAB and BCOMD to balance capacity and energy efficiency, showing improved performance over 3GPP standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored role of NTNs in reducing TN load and enhancing sustainability amid terrestrial network densification concerns.

Method: A novel online optimization framework based on MAB and BCOMD, optimizing bandwidth allocation, UE association, and MBS shutdown in real time.

Result: Simulations show reduced unsatisfied UEs during peak hours, 19% throughput gains, and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances network sustainability and performance, outperforming standard 3GPP settings.

Abstract: Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN) architectures
offer a promising solution for expanding coverage and improving capacity for
the network. While non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are primarily exploited for
these specific reasons, their role in alleviating terrestrial network (TN) load
and enabling energy-efficient operation has received comparatively less
attention. In light of growing concerns associated with the densification of
terrestrial deployments, this work aims to explore the potential of NTNs in
supporting a more sustainable network. In this paper, we propose a novel online
optimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a
multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback
Constrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively
optimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment
(UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network
capacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations
over a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the
proportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19%
throughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming
standard network settings following 3GPP recommendations.

*Lei Deng,Wenhan Xu,Jingwei Li,Danny H. K. Tsang*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A generative model approach for real-time network traffic forecasting with missing data, leveraging tensor completion and latent representation optimization for accurate and fast predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume complete data, but real-world scenarios often involve missing data due to human and natural factors.

Method: Model the task as tensor completion, use a pre-trained generative model to capture low-rank structure, and optimize latent representations for real-time forecasting.

Result: Achieves accurate forecasting within 100 ms with MAE below 0.002 on the Abilene dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles missing data and enables real-time, accurate network traffic forecasting.

Abstract: Real-time network traffic forecasting is crucial for network management and
early resource allocation. Existing network traffic forecasting approaches
operate under the assumption that the network traffic data is fully observed.
However, in practical scenarios, the collected data are often incomplete due to
various human and natural factors. In this paper, we propose a generative model
approach for real-time network traffic forecasting with missing data. Firstly,
we model the network traffic forecasting task as a tensor completion problem.
Secondly, we incorporate a pre-trained generative model to achieve the low-rank
structure commonly associated with tensor completion. The generative model
effectively captures the intrinsic low-rank structure of network traffic data
during pre-training and enables the mapping from a compact latent
representation to the tensor space. Thirdly, rather than directly optimizing
the high-dimensional tensor, we optimize its latent representation, which
simplifies the optimization process and enables real-time forecasting. We also
establish a theoretical recovery guarantee that quantifies the error bound of
the proposed approach. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach achieves accurate network traffic forecasting within 100 ms, with a
mean absolute error (MAE) below 0.002, as validated on the Abilene dataset.

Motivation: To create a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem where humans and AI collaborate equally, free from centralized control.

Method: Decentralized multi-agent architecture, symbiotic collaboration, resilient self-adaptation, and a six-phase workflow for task allocation.

Result: A scalable, censorship-resistant system with dynamic task allocation, fault tolerance, and reputation tracking via $ISEK tokens.

Conclusion: ISEK enables large-scale, decentralized cognitive systems, shifting from centralized platforms to organic, emergent intelligence.

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a
decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents
collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on
Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a
decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic
AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient
self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a
six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for
dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a
multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the
native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and
reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based
identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and
incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates
emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional
platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized
cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond
centralized constraints.

*Michael Amir,Matteo Bettini,Amanda Prorok*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores when diversity in multi-agent teams outperforms homogeneity, focusing on reward design and using MARL to validate theoretical insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when heterogeneous teams surpass homogeneous ones in multi-agent task allocation, particularly from a reward design perspective.

Method: Theoretical analysis of reward operators' curvature and introduction of Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED) for MARL to incentivize heterogeneity.

Result: Proves curvature determines heterogeneity's advantage and validates HED in matrix games and embodied environments.

Conclusion: Provides insights into when behavioral diversity benefits multi-agent systems, bridging theory and MARL applications.

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the
division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation
for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing
on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question
from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited
for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial
setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation
operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on
individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$
task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these
operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for
broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask
what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents
must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such
settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational
paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a
gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified
MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.
Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show
that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes
predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both
validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in
MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity
delivers a measurable benefit.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system to test policy-adherent LLM-based agents against adversarial users, outperforming traditional jailbreak methods. It also proposes tau-break, a benchmark for robustness evaluation, and evaluates defense strategies, finding them insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLM-based agents adhere to strict policies while maintaining natural interactions and resisting adversarial exploitation.

Method: Proposes CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system using policy-aware persuasive strategies, and introduces tau-break for robustness benchmarking. Evaluates defense strategies.

Result: CRAFT outperforms traditional jailbreak methods; tau-break assesses robustness; evaluated defenses are inadequate.

Conclusion: Stronger safeguards are needed to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict
policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies
in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies,
appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still
maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development
of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience
against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses
on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal
benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system
that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a
policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming
conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and
coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce
tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's
robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several
straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide
some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger,
research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial
attacks

TL;DR: Machine learning surrogate models predict PEALD saturation times and surface recombination dominance with high accuracy, reducing experimental needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimize PEALD in high aspect ratio features by addressing long exposure times due to surface recombination.

Method: Train artificial neural networks on synthetic PEALD simulation data to predict saturation times and surface recombination dominance.

Result: Two undersaturated experiments predict saturation times within 10% error; surrogate model achieves 99% accuracy for recombination dominance.

Conclusion: Machine learning accelerates PEALD optimization and can extend to atomic layer etching and complex structures.

Abstract: In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic
layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based
processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can
dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead to
unfeasibly long exposure times to achieve full conformality inside
nanostructures like high aspect ratio vias. Using a synthetic dataset based on
simulations of PEALD, we train artificial neural networks to predict saturation
times based on cross section thickness data obtained for partially coated
conditions. The results obtained show that just two experiments in
undersaturated conditions contain enough information to predict saturation
times within 10% of the ground truth. A surrogate model trained to determine
whether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a
PEALD process achieves 99% accuracy. This demonstrates that machine learning
can provide a new pathway to accelerate the optimization of PEALD processes in
areas such as microelectronics. Our approach can be easily extended to atomic
layer etching and more complex structures.

*Tonghe Wang,Yining Feng,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning (RL) can autonomously generate HDR prostate brachytherapy plans, improving plan quality and reducing needle usage compared to clinical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current needle placement in HDR prostate brachytherapy relies on physician experience, leading to variability. RL could standardize planning and improve efficiency.

Method: A RL agent adjusts needle positions and dwell times iteratively to maximize a reward function, using patient anatomy data. Plans were tested on 10 patients.

Result: RL plans matched clinical plans in prostate coverage and rectum dose but reduced prostate hotspots and urethra dose. They also used fewer needles.

Conclusion: RL is feasible for autonomous brachytherapy planning, offering improved quality, fewer needles, and potential to standardize procedures.

Abstract: Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the
pattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We
investigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide
needle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning
stage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan
quality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of
one selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined
reward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent
then moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple
rounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.
Plan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for
testing) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric
metrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the
clinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical
plans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no
statistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate
V150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans
use 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the
first study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to
autonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.
This RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to
conventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal
data requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial
potential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability,
and enhance patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of external sources on the asymptotic behavior of recursively trained generative models.

Method: Analyze the asymptotic behaviors of generative models with and without external sample contributions.

Result: Two distinct asymptotic behaviors emerge: collapse without an external source and stability with one.

Conclusion: External sources, even minor, significantly alter the asymptotic behavior of recursively trained generative models.

Abstract: It is known that recursive training from generative models can lead to the so
called `collapse' of the simulated probability distribution. This note shows
that one in fact gets two different asymptotic behaviours depending on whether
an external source, howsoever minor, is also contributing samples.

Motivation: To assess the privacy benefits of speaker anonymization systems by examining the role of intra-speaker linguistic content similarity in ASV attacks.

Method: Adapts BERT as an ASV system to evaluate the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge datasets, focusing on textual content.

Result: Achieves a mean EER of 35%, with some speakers as low as 2%, and identifies semantic keywords as decision drivers.

Conclusion: Recommends reworking datasets for fair evaluation and questions the reliance on global EER for privacy assessments.

Abstract: Speaker anonymization systems hide the identity of speakers while preserving
other information such as linguistic content and emotions. To evaluate their
privacy benefits, attacks in the form of automatic speaker verification (ASV)
systems are employed. In this study, we assess the impact of intra-speaker
linguistic content similarity in the attacker training and evaluation datasets,
by adapting BERT, a language model, as an ASV system. On the VoicePrivacy
Attacker Challenge datasets, our method achieves a mean equal error rate (EER)
of 35%, with certain speakers attaining EERs as low as 2%, based solely on the
textual content of their utterances. Our explainability study reveals that the
system decisions are linked to semantically similar keywords within utterances,
stemming from how LibriSpeech is curated. Our study suggests reworking the
VoicePrivacy datasets to ensure a fair and unbiased evaluation and challenge
the reliance on global EER for privacy evaluations.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A method for automatic temporal localization of key PE therapy fidelity elements from audio and transcripts, using a fine-tuned audio-language model with LoRA, achieving a 5.3s MAE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual review of PE therapy sessions for fidelity evaluation is labor-intensive; automation can improve scalability.

Method: Fine-tunes Qwen2-Audio with LoRA on 30s audio-transcript windows, using LLM-based prompting for fidelity labels and soft supervision for boundary prediction.

Result: Achieves 5.3s MAE on 313 PE sessions; analyzes effects of window size and LoRA rank.

Conclusion: Introduces a scalable framework for PE fidelity tracking, aiding clinician training and quality assurance.

Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains
labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We
present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity
elements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session
audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained
audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process
focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three
core protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and
post-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and
verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary
offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of
313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further
analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance
of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable
framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support
clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.

### [366] [Regularizing Learnable Feature Extraction for Automatic Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09804)
*Peter Vieting,Maximilian Kannen,Benedikt Hilmes,Ralf Schlüter,Hermann Ney*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores regularization methods to improve neural front-ends for ASR, addressing overfitting and outperforming traditional feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural front-ends for ASR often underperform due to overfitting, prompting the need for better regularization techniques.

Method: Investigates audio perturbation and modifies SpecAugment by masking in the STFT-domain to enhance regularization.

Result: The proposed methods effectively close the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Conclusion: Improved regularization techniques make neural front-ends competitive with classical ASR feature extraction methods.

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature
extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they
can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance
often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due
to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore
investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable
feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and
show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features.
Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment
for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform
(STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these
challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively
closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

Deep\nlearning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved\ngood performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human\nperception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.\nConsequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual\nquality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE\nmethod with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss\nmodule and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a\nperception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual\nperception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model\nis leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the\nquality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated\nas a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the\nperceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model\nis integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the\nconstraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,\nmitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.\nSpecifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize\nthe learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,\nensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and\nnegatives with varied quality levels.

Existing interpretability methods\nlike Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each\nmodel, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model\ninterpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for\nAligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,\nunified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,\nvision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is\nenforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,\nensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given\nconcept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages\nsemantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically\nimproves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than\ntripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared\nsparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar\nhigh-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of\nhow different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring\nmanual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned\nrepresentation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided\nspatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal\nretrieval.

Medical evacuation planning involves designing\na robust network of medical platforms and facilities capable of moving and\ntreating large numbers of casualties. Until now, there has not been a medium to\nsimulate these networks in a classroom setting and evaluate both offline\nplanning and online decision-making performance. This work describes the\nMedical Evacuation Wargaming Initiative (MEWI), a three-dimensional multiplayer\nsimulation developed in Unity that replicates battlefield constraints and\nuncertainties. MEWI accurately models patient interactions at casualty\ncollection points, ambulance exchange points, medical treatment facilities, and\nevacuation platforms. Two operational scenarios are introduced: an amphibious\nisland assault in the Pacific and a Eurasian conflict across a sprawling road\nand river network. These scenarios pit students against the clock to save as\nmany casualties as possible while adhering to doctrinal lessons learned during\ndidactic training. We visualize performance data collected from two iterations\nof the MEWI Pacific scenario executed in the United States Army's Medical\nEvacuation Doctrine Course. We consider post-wargame Likert survey data from\nstudent participants and external observer notes to identify key planning\ndecision points, document medical evacuation lessons learned, and quantify\ngeneral utility. Results indicate that MEWI participation substantially\nimproves uptake of medical evacuation lessons learned and co-operative\ndecision-making.

In real-world applications, data samples are noisy, so it is\nimportant to know when a predictor can still achieve low empirical risk.\nHowever, little is known about the conditions under which a PINN can do so\neffectively. We prove a lower bound on the size of neural networks required for\nthe supervised PINN empirical risk to fall below the variance of noisy\nsupervision labels. Specifically, if a predictor achieves an empirical risk\n$O(\\eta)$ below $\\sigma^2$ (variance of supervision data), then necessarily\n$d_N\\log d_N\\gtrsim N_s \\eta^2$, where $N_s$ is the number of samples and $d_N$\nis the number of trainable parameters of the PINN. A similar constraint applies\nto the fully unsupervised PINN setting when boundary labels are sampled\nnoisily. Consequently, increasing the number of noisy supervision labels alone\ndoes not provide a ``free lunch'' in reducing empirical risk. We also show\nempirically that PINNs can indeed achieve empirical risks below $\\sigma^2$\nunder such conditions. As a case study, we investigate PINNs applied to the\nHamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) PDE.

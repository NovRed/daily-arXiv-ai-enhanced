First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms\nvision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on\nout-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than\nagent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time\ngeneralization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused\nembeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine\nsimilarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of\nmaterial well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the\nPlatonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms\nagent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest\ngains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that\nagent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not\nfully captured by static LLM knowledge.

To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong\nbaselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,\nframe-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We\nobserve that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each\ntimestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or\nnon-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the\nimplementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time\ncomplexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over\nbaselines.

To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we\npropose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning\nframework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically\nvalid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates\nseamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the\nagent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,\nsimulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate\nconsistently high attack success rates (81\\%-95\\%) and significant privacy\nleakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack\nremains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured\ntool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic\nvulnerabilities in current agent architectures.

Recent advances in learned data\nstructures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these\ncomponents, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this\nwork, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the\nLSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom\nfilter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query\nlatency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned\nmodels and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without\ncompromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style\nLSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic\nworkloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up\nto 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,\nthough it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design\nachieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory\nusage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary\ntrade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the\npotential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper explores integrating machine learning into LSM-trees to reduce read amplification, proposing two methods: a classifier to bypass Bloom filters and learned Bloom filters for memory efficiency.", "motivation": "LSM-trees optimize writes but suffer from read amplification.

To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced\nReasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed\nreasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A\nfirst leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer\nlatent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify\nrelevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a\nreinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions\narising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results\nshow that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of\nrelevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "R3A improves relevance assessment in UGC platforms by decomposing reasoning and leveraging auxiliary documents, outperforming baselines.", "motivation": "Address challenges in UGC platforms: ambiguous user intent and noisy unstructured language in RAG scenarios.", "method": "Proposes R3A, a decomposed reasoning framework using auxiliary documents and verbatim fragment extraction, optimized via reinforcement learning.", "result": "R3A significantly outperforms baselines in relevance accuracy in offline and online experiments.", "conclusion": "R3A effectively mitigates distortions from ambiguous queries and noisy content, enhancing relevance assessment."}}

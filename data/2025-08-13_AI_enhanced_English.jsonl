Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the\noffset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional\narchitectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including\nADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent\nimprovements with negligible parameters.

In this\npaper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key\nchallenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation\nmodels, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core\nmodules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to\nunify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and\ncurriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more\ninformative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also\nfacilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.\nExtensive experiments on \\textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet\noutperforms SoTA approaches by \\textbf{6.3\\%}, highlighting its effectiveness\nin leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the\nincreasing realism of deepfakes.", "AI": {"tldr": "DPGNet introduces a dual-path approach to improve deepfake detection by leveraging unlabeled data and addressing domain gaps, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 6.3%.", "motivation": "The increasing realism of deepfakes makes labeling unreliable and time-consuming, necessitating methods to utilize unlabeled data effectively.", "method": "DPGNet uses text-guided cross-domain alignment and curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, with cross-domain knowledge distillation to prevent forgetting.", "result": "DPGNet achieves a 6.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods across 11 datasets.", "conclusion": "DPGNet effectively addresses annotation challenges by leveraging unlabeled data and bridging domain gaps, proving robust against realistic deepfakes."}}

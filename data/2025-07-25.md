### [1] [Lumina-mGPT 2.0: Stand-Alone AutoRegressive Image Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17801)
*Yi Xin,Juncheng Yan,Qi Qin,Zhen Li,Dongyang Liu,Shicheng Li,Victor Shea-Jay Huang,Yupeng Zhou,Renrui Zhang,Le Zhuo,Tiancheng Han,Xiaoqing Sun,Siqi Luo,Mengmeng Wang,Bin Fu,Yuewen Cao,Hongsheng Li,Guangtao Zhai,Xiaohong Liu,Yu Qiao,Peng Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a standalone autoregressive model for high-quality image generation, outperforming diffusion models like DALL-E 3 and SANA, with multi-task capabilities and efficient decoding strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revitalize autoregressive modeling for image generation without relying on pretrained components, enabling unrestricted design and licensing freedom.

Method: Trained from scratch with a unified tokenization scheme, handling tasks like image editing and controllable synthesis within a single framework. Efficient decoding strategies (inference-time scaling, speculative Jacobi sampling) improve quality and speed.

Result: Matches or surpasses diffusion models on benchmarks (GenEval, DPG) and excels in multi-task performance (Graph200K).

Conclusion: Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is a strong, flexible foundation model for unified multimodal generation, with released training details and code.

Abstract: We present Lumina-mGPT 2.0, a stand-alone, decoder-only autoregressive model
that revisits and revitalizes the autoregressive paradigm for high-quality
image generation and beyond. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pretrained
components or hybrid architectures, Lumina-mGPT 2.0 is trained entirely from
scratch, enabling unrestricted architectural design and licensing freedom. It
achieves generation quality on par with state-of-the-art diffusion models such
as DALL-E 3 and SANA, while preserving the inherent flexibility and
compositionality of autoregressive modeling. Our unified tokenization scheme
allows the model to seamlessly handle a wide spectrum of tasks-including
subject-driven generation, image editing, controllable synthesis, and dense
prediction-within a single generative framework. To further boost usability, we
incorporate efficient decoding strategies like inference-time scaling and
speculative Jacobi sampling to improve quality and speed, respectively.
Extensive evaluations on standard text-to-image benchmarks (e.g., GenEval, DPG)
demonstrate that Lumina-mGPT 2.0 not only matches but in some cases surpasses
diffusion-based models. Moreover, we confirm its multi-task capabilities on the
Graph200K benchmark, with the native Lumina-mGPT 2.0 performing exceptionally
well. These results position Lumina-mGPT 2.0 as a strong, flexible foundation
model for unified multimodal generation. We have released our training details,
code, and models at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT-2.0.

### [2] [SV3.3B: A Sports Video Understanding Model for Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17844)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Yashwanth Reddy Vutukoori,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SV3.3B is a lightweight 3.3B parameter model for automated sports video analysis, excelling in fine-grained biomechanical understanding and on-device deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports video analysis lacks fine-grained understanding and is computationally intensive, missing critical movement phases.

Method: Combines temporal motion difference sampling, self-supervised learning, DWT-VGG16-LDA keyframe extraction, V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder, and LLM decoder.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o variants in sports-specific metrics, achieving 29.2% improvement in ground truth validation.

Conclusion: SV3.3B offers efficient, detailed sports analysis with lower computational costs, advancing automated athletic evaluation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automated sports video analysis, which
has traditionally been limited by computationally intensive models requiring
server-side processing and lacking fine-grained understanding of athletic
movements. Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical
transitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical
phases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within
seconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B
parameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion
difference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device
deployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction
mechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from
sports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through
mask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action
description generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,
SV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation
metrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger
closed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly
lower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability
in generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,
achieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,
with substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and
measurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.

### [3] [Detail++: Training-Free Detail Enhancer for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17853)
*Lifeng Chen,Jiner Wang,Zihao Pan,Beier Zhu,Xiaofeng Yang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Detail++ is a training-free framework using Progressive Detail Injection (PDI) to improve text-to-image generation for complex prompts by decomposing them into simpler sub-prompts and refining stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple subjects and attributes, prompting the need for a method mimicking human drawing processes.

Method: Proposes Detail++ with PDI, decomposing prompts into stages, leveraging self-attention for layout control, and using cross-attention and Centroid Alignment Loss for attribute binding.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on T2I-CompBench and a new style benchmark, especially for multi-object and complex style scenarios.

Conclusion: Detail++ effectively addresses limitations in complex prompt handling, offering a robust solution for detailed and accurate text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to impressive
visual results. However, these models still face significant challenges when
handling complex prompt, particularly those involving multiple subjects with
distinct attributes. Inspired by the human drawing process, which first
outlines the composition and then incrementally adds details, we propose
Detail++, a training-free framework that introduces a novel Progressive Detail
Injection (PDI) strategy to address this limitation. Specifically, we decompose
a complex prompt into a sequence of simplified sub-prompts, guiding the
generation process in stages. This staged generation leverages the inherent
layout-controlling capacity of self-attention to first ensure global
composition, followed by precise refinement. To achieve accurate binding
between attributes and corresponding subjects, we exploit cross-attention
mechanisms and further introduce a Centroid Alignment Loss at test time to
reduce binding noise and enhance attribute consistency. Extensive experiments
on T2I-CompBench and a newly constructed style composition benchmark
demonstrate that Detail++ significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scenarios involving multiple objects and complex stylistic
conditions.

*Muayad Abujabal,Lyes Saad Saoud,Irfan Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FishDet-M is a large unified benchmark for fish detection, harmonizing 13 datasets with COCO-style annotations. It evaluates 28 models, introduces a CLIP-based selection framework, and provides tools for underwater computer vision research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols in underwater fish detection.

Method: Harmonize 13 datasets with COCO-style annotations, benchmark 28 object detection models, and introduce a CLIP-based model selection framework.

Result: Varying detection performance across models, trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, and high performance of the CLIP-based selection strategy.

Conclusion: FishDet-M offers a standardized, reproducible platform for underwater fish detection, supporting future research with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological
monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical
deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging
conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we
present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,
comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments
including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are
harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and
segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.
We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering
the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.
Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and
mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and
inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results
highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,
as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of
different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a
CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment
to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each
input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance
without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for
real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible
platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All
datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to
facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine
systems.

### [5] [Towards Facilitated Fairness Assessment of AI-based Skin Lesion Classifiers Through GenAI-based Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17860)
*Ko Watanabe. Stanislav Frolov. Adriano Lucieri. Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using Generative AI (LightningDiT) to assess fairness in melanoma classifiers, highlighting challenges and potential with synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases in deep learning for skin cancer screening by ensuring fairness across diverse groups.

Method: Leveraging the LightningDiT model to generate synthetic data for fairness evaluation of melanoma classifiers.

Result: Fairness assessment with synthetic data is promising but challenging if training data differs from synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data offers a new way to evaluate and improve fairness in medical-imaging AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and its application on the edge hold
great potential for the revolution of routine screenings for skin cancers like
Melanoma. Along with the anticipated benefits of this technology, potential
dangers arise from unforseen and inherent biases. Thus, assessing and improving
the fairness of such systems is of utmost importance. A key challenge in
fairness assessment is to ensure that the evaluation dataset is sufficiently
representative of different Personal Identifiable Information (PII) (sex, age,
and race) and other minority groups. Against the backdrop of this challenge,
this study leverages the state-of-the-art Generative AI (GenAI) LightningDiT
model to assess the fairness of publicly available melanoma classifiers. The
results suggest that fairness assessment using highly realistic synthetic data
is a promising direction. Yet, our findings indicate that verifying fairness
becomes difficult when the melanoma-detection model used for evaluation is
trained on data that differ from the dataset underpinning the synthetic images.
Nonetheless, we propose that our approach offers a valuable new avenue for
employing synthetic data to gauge and enhance fairness in medical-imaging GenAI
systems.

### [6] [DiNAT-IR: Exploring Dilated Neighborhood Attention for High-Quality Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17892)
*Hanzhou Liu,Binghan Li,Chengkai Liu,Mi Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Restormer uses channel-wise self-attention for image restoration but may miss local artifacts. DiNA balances global and local context but struggles with deblurring. DiNAT-IR, with a channel-aware module, improves results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational efficiency and quality in image restoration, especially for high-resolution images.

Method: Proposes DiNAT-IR, combining Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) with a channel-aware module to integrate global context and local precision.

Result: DiNAT-IR achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmarks for image restoration.

Conclusion: DiNAT-IR offers a scalable and high-quality solution for low-level vision tasks by balancing global and local context.

Abstract: Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms for modeling long-range
dependencies, have become a dominant paradigm in image restoration tasks.
However, the high computational cost of self-attention limits scalability to
high-resolution images, making efficiency-quality trade-offs a key research
focus. To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which
computes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions. While
effective, this approach may overlook localized artifacts that are crucial for
high-quality image restoration. To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated
Neighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its
success in high-level vision tasks. DiNA balances global context and local
precision by integrating sliding-window attention with mixed dilation factors,
effectively expanding the receptive field without excessive overhead. However,
our preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local
design to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,
primarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local
attention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that
complements local attention, effectively integrating global context without
sacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based
architecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive
results across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for
diverse low-level computer vision problems.

### [7] [AFRDA: Attentive Feature Refinement for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17957)
*Md. Al-Masrur Khan,Durgakant Pushp,Lantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Adaptive Feature Refinement (AFR) module to improve segmentation accuracy in Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) by balancing local and global information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA-SS methods struggle with balancing fine-grained local details and global contextual information, leading to segmentation errors.

Method: The AFR module refines high-resolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits, integrates high-frequency components for boundary details, and uses uncertainty-driven attention to balance local and global information.

Result: AFR improves UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V → Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on Synthia → Cityscapes.

Conclusion: The lightweight AFR module enhances segmentation performance and is easily integrated into existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: In Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS), a model is
trained on labeled source domain data (e.g., synthetic images) and adapted to
an unlabeled target domain (e.g., real-world images) without access to target
annotations. Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained
local details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation
errors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature
Refinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining
highresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR
also integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained
structures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object
delineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information
through uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its
lightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,
leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our approach improves
existing UDA-SS methods by 1.05% mIoU on GTA V --> Cityscapes and 1.04% mIoU on
Synthia-->Cityscapes. The implementation of our framework is available at:

### [8] [OPEN: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline for Older Adult Patient Engagement Recognition in Virtual Rehabilitation Learning Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17959)
*Ali Abedi,Sadaf Safa,Tracey J. F. Colella,Shehroz S. Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OPEN, a dataset for AI-driven engagement recognition in older adults during virtual group learning, achieving 81% accuracy with machine learning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate engagement measurement in virtual group settings, especially for older adults, is challenging. Existing methods lack contextual relevance and longitudinal focus.

Method: OPEN dataset was created from 11 older adults in weekly virtual cardiac rehab sessions over 6 weeks, featuring facial, hand, and body landmarks, plus affective/behavioral features.

Result: Machine learning models trained on OPEN achieved up to 81% accuracy in engagement recognition.

Conclusion: OPEN supports scalable, personalized engagement modeling for aging populations and advances engagement recognition research.

Abstract: Engagement in virtual learning is essential for participant satisfaction,
performance, and adherence, particularly in online education and virtual
rehabilitation, where interactive communication plays a key role. Yet,
accurately measuring engagement in virtual group settings remains a challenge.
There is increasing interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) for
large-scale, real-world, automated engagement recognition. While engagement has
been widely studied in younger academic populations, research and datasets
focused on older adults in virtual and telehealth learning settings remain
limited. Existing methods often neglect contextual relevance and the
longitudinal nature of engagement across sessions. This paper introduces OPEN
(Older adult Patient ENgagement), a novel dataset supporting AI-driven
engagement recognition. It was collected from eleven older adults participating
in weekly virtual group learning sessions over six weeks as part of cardiac
rehabilitation, producing over 35 hours of data, making it the largest dataset
of its kind. To protect privacy, raw video is withheld; instead, the released
data include facial, hand, and body joint landmarks, along with affective and
behavioral features extracted from video. Annotations include binary engagement
states, affective and behavioral labels, and context-type indicators, such as
whether the instructor addressed the group or an individual. The dataset offers
versions with 5-, 10-, 30-second, and variable-length samples. To demonstrate
utility, multiple machine learning and deep learning models were trained,
achieving engagement recognition accuracy of up to 81 percent. OPEN provides a
scalable foundation for personalized engagement modeling in aging populations
and contributes to broader engagement recognition research.

### [9] [Bearded Dragon Activity Recognition Pipeline: An AI-Based Approach to Behavioural Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17987)
*Arsen Yermukan,Pedro Machado,Feliciano Domingos,Isibor Kennedy Ihianle,Jordan J. Bird,Stefano S. K. Kaburu,Samantha J. Ward*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated system using YOLO models for real-time video analysis of bearded dragon behaviors (basking and hunting) was developed, with YOLOv8s performing best. Basking detection was reliable, but hunting detection was less accurate due to weak cricket detection. Future work aims to improve cricket detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon behavior is time-consuming and error-prone, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Five YOLO variants were trained on a custom dataset (1200 images). YOLOv8s was selected for its accuracy and speed. The system processes video footage with object detection, temporal interpolation, and rule-based behavior classification.

Result: YOLOv8s achieved high accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855). Basking detection was reliable, but hunting detection suffered due to poor cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).

Conclusion: The automated system improves reptile behavior monitoring efficiency and data quality, with future focus on enhancing cricket detection.

Abstract: Traditional monitoring of bearded dragon (Pogona Viticeps) behaviour is
time-consuming and prone to errors. This project introduces an automated system
for real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection
models to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five
YOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of
1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and
crickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior
balance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes
video footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal
interpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific
behaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was
less accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).
Future improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded
datasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a
scalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,
significantly improving research efficiency and data quality.

*Huy Nguyen,Kien Nguyen,Akila Pemasiri,Akmal Jahan,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG-VPReID.VIR is the first aerial-ground cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset, addressing limitations of ground-level IR systems. The proposed TCC-VPReID framework tackles cross-platform and cross-modality challenges, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets focus on ground-level perspectives, which suffer from occlusions and limited coverage. Aerial perspectives solve these issues, necessitating a new dataset and method for cross-modality Re-ID.

Method: Introduces AG-VPReID.VIR dataset with 1,837 identities across RGB and IR modalities. Proposes TCC-VPReID, a three-stream architecture using style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and intermediary-guided temporal modeling.

Result: AG-VPReID.VIR presents unique challenges like cross-viewpoint variations and modality discrepancies. TCC-VPReID achieves significant performance gains across evaluation protocols.

Conclusion: The dataset and framework address aerial-ground and RGB-IR modality gaps, advancing cross-modality person Re-ID for 24-hour surveillance.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) across visible and infrared modalities is
crucial for 24-hour surveillance systems, but existing datasets primarily focus
on ground-level perspectives. While ground-based IR systems offer nighttime
capabilities, they suffer from occlusions, limited coverage, and vulnerability
to obstructions--problems that aerial perspectives uniquely solve. To address
these limitations, we introduce AG-VPReID.VIR, the first aerial-ground
cross-modality video-based person Re-ID dataset. This dataset captures 1,837
identities across 4,861 tracklets (124,855 frames) using both UAV-mounted and
fixed CCTV cameras in RGB and infrared modalities. AG-VPReID.VIR presents
unique challenges including cross-viewpoint variations, modality discrepancies,
and temporal dynamics. Additionally, we propose TCC-VPReID, a novel
three-stream architecture designed to address the joint challenges of
cross-platform and cross-modality person Re-ID. Our approach bridges the domain
gaps between aerial-ground perspectives and RGB-IR modalities, through
style-robust feature learning, memory-based cross-view adaptation, and
intermediary-guided temporal modeling. Experiments show that AG-VPReID.VIR
presents distinctive challenges compared to existing datasets, with our
TCC-VPReID framework achieving significant performance gains across multiple
evaluation protocols. Dataset and code are available at

### [11] [Exploring the interplay of label bias with subgroup size and separability: A case study in mammographic density classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17996)
*Emma A. M. Stanley,Raghav Mehta,Mélanie Roschewitz,Nils D. Forkert,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how label bias in medical imaging datasets affects deep learning models, focusing on subgroup size and separability. It reveals shifts in learned features and performance disparities based on validation set labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the understudied issue of label bias in medical AI systems, particularly its impact on subgroup fairness in medical imaging datasets.

Method: Trained deep learning models for binary tissue density classification using the EMBED dataset, simulating label bias in separable and non-separable subgroups.

Result: Label bias caused shifts in feature representations, influenced by subgroup size and separability. Performance varied significantly based on validation set label cleanliness.

Conclusion: The study highlights the critical impact of label bias on subgroup fairness in medical AI, emphasizing the need for clean validation labels.

Abstract: Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in
medical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the
fairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and
separability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features
and performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning
models for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging
Dataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on
imaging manufacturer) or non-separable "pseudo-subgroups". We found that
simulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature
representations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature
space were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the
subgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in
subgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels
was used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,
with label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive
rate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean
labels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work
represents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label
bias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.

### [12] [Registration beyond Points: General Affine Subspace Alignment via Geodesic Distance on Grassmann Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17998)
*Jaeho Shin,Hyeonjae Gil,Junwoo Jang,Maani Ghaffari,Ayoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper derives an optimizable cost function for the Grassmannian manifold, enabling rigid body transformation-based registration by minimizing geodesic distance, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack an explicit, optimizable distance function for Grassmannian features, limiting their use in registration problems.

Method: The paper mathematically proves that high-dimensional subspace bases can represent the cost and proposes an optimizable function based on transformed bases.

Result: The derived cost function improves convergence and performance in computer vision tasks, offering globally optimal solutions.

Conclusion: The method advances Grassmannian-based registration by providing an explicit, optimizable cost function, with demonstrated superiority in applications.

Abstract: Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines
and planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among
features. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the
proximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body
transformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has
remained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.
This paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function
between two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation
($\mathbf{R}$ and $\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous
mathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear
subspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we
propose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be
applied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector
parameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal
solution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to
representation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the
inlier-set maximizing \ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the
convergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision
tasks. The code is available on

Motivation: Current multimodal models lag behind LLMs in architectural sophistication, prompting the need for improvements.

Method: Incorporated Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into CoCa's textual decoders and ViT encoder.

Result: GRR-CoCa showed significant improvements: 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss during pretraining. Fine-tuning improvements averaged 13.66%, 5.18%, and 5.55% respectively.

Conclusion: GRR-CoCa's architecture enhances performance and generalization in vision-language tasks.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) image and text generation models are multimodal
models that have many similarities to large language models (LLMs). Despite
achieving strong performances, leading foundational multimodal model
architectures frequently lag behind the architectural sophistication of
contemporary LLMs. We propose GRR-CoCa, an improved SOTA Contrastive Captioner
(CoCa) model that incorporates Gaussian error gated linear units, root mean
squared normalization, and rotary positional embedding into the textual
decoders and the vision transformer (ViT) encoder. Each architectural
modification has been shown to improve model performance in LLMs, but has yet
to be adopted in CoCa. We benchmarked GRR-CoCa against Baseline CoCa, a model
with the same modified textual decoders but with CoCa's original ViT encoder.
We used standard pretraining and fine-tuning workflows to benchmark the models
on contrastive and generative tasks. Our GRR-CoCa significantly outperformed
Baseline CoCa on the pretraining dataset and three diverse fine-tuning
datasets. Pretraining improvements were 27.25% in contrastive loss, 3.71% in
perplexity, and 7.15% in CoCa loss. The average fine-tuning improvements were
13.66% in contrastive loss, 5.18% in perplexity, and 5.55% in CoCa loss. We
show that GRR-CoCa's modified architecture improves performance and
generalization across vision-language domains.

*Yuezun Li,Delong Zhu,Xinjie Cui,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Celeb-DF++, a large-scale DeepFake dataset with diverse forgery types to address the challenge of generalizable forensics, and evaluates 24 detection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of DeepFake videos online necessitates datasets with rich forgery diversity for developing generalizable detection models, which existing datasets lack.

Method: The authors expand the Celeb-DF dataset to create Celeb-DF++, covering three forgery scenarios (Face-swap, Face-reenactment, Talking-face) using 22 DeepFake methods. They also introduce evaluation protocols for 24 detection methods.

Result: Celeb-DF++ provides a challenging benchmark, revealing limitations in existing detection methods when faced with diverse forgery types.

Conclusion: The dataset and evaluation protocols highlight the need for more robust and generalizable DeepFake detection methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly increased the
diversity of DeepFake videos circulating online, posing a pressing challenge
for \textit{generalizable forensics}, \ie, detecting a wide range of unseen
DeepFake types using a single model. Addressing this challenge requires
datasets that are not only large-scale but also rich in forgery diversity.
However, most existing datasets, despite their scale, include only a limited
variety of forgery types, making them insufficient for developing generalizable
detection methods. Therefore, we build upon our earlier Celeb-DF dataset and
introduce {Celeb-DF++}, a new large-scale and challenging video DeepFake
benchmark dedicated to the generalizable forensics challenge. Celeb-DF++ covers
three commonly encountered forgery scenarios: Face-swap (FS), Face-reenactment
(FR), and Talking-face (TF). Each scenario contains a substantial number of
high-quality forged videos, generated using a total of 22 various recent
DeepFake methods. These methods differ in terms of architectures, generation
pipelines, and targeted facial regions, covering the most prevalent DeepFake
cases witnessed in the wild. We also introduce evaluation protocols for
measuring the generalizability of 24 recent detection methods, highlighting the
limitations of existing detection methods and the difficulty of our new
dataset.

*Jun Zhou,Dinghao Li,Nannan Li,Mingjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Gaussian inpainting framework improves 3D scene reconstruction by refining masks and optimizing regions with uncertainty guidance, outperforming existing methods in quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inpainting 3D scenes is challenging due to irregular structures and multi-view consistency needs, which current methods struggle to address.

Method: The framework uses an automatic Mask Refinement Process and Uncertainty-guided Optimization, refining masks with Gaussian filtering and back-projection, and optimizing regions based on multi-view importance.

Result: Experiments show superior visual quality and view consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses 3D inpainting challenges, enhancing fidelity and consistency in reconstructed scenes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis,
particularly through Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have greatly enhanced the fidelity and efficiency of 3D content
creation. However, inpainting 3D scenes remains a challenging task due to the
inherent irregularity of 3D structures and the critical need for maintaining
multi-view consistency. In this work, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian inpainting
framework that reconstructs complete 3D scenes by leveraging sparse inpainted
views. Our framework incorporates an automatic Mask Refinement Process and
region-wise Uncertainty-guided Optimization. Specifically, we refine the
inpainting mask using a series of operations, including Gaussian scene
filtering and back-projection, enabling more accurate localization of occluded
regions and realistic boundary restoration. Furthermore, our Uncertainty-guided
Fine-grained Optimization strategy, which estimates the importance of each
region across multi-view images during training, alleviates multi-view
inconsistencies and enhances the fidelity of fine details in the inpainted
results. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
quality and view consistency.

TL;DR: A survey on skeleton-based emotion recognition, covering psychological models, datasets, methods (posture/gait-based), technical paradigms, applications in mental health, and future challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore privacy-preserving emotion recognition via body movements, leveraging advancements in 3D skeleton technology.

Method: Systematic review of techniques, categorized into posture/gait-based approaches and four technical paradigms (Traditional, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, End2EndNet).

Result: Benchmarked results across datasets, highlighting effectiveness of different methods.

Conclusion: Identifies potential in mental health applications but notes open challenges and future research needs.

Abstract: Emotion recognition through body movements has emerged as a compelling and
privacy-preserving alternative to traditional methods that rely on facial
expressions or physiological signals. Recent advancements in 3D skeleton
acquisition technologies and pose estimation algorithms have significantly
enhanced the feasibility of emotion recognition based on full-body motion. This
survey provides a comprehensive and systematic review of skeleton-based emotion
recognition techniques. First, we introduce psychological models of emotion and
examine the relationship between bodily movements and emotional expression.
Next, we summarize publicly available datasets, highlighting the differences in
data acquisition methods and emotion labeling strategies. We then categorize
existing methods into posture-based and gait-based approaches, analyzing them
from both data-driven and technical perspectives. In particular, we propose a
unified taxonomy that encompasses four primary technical paradigms: Traditional
approaches, Feat2Net, FeatFusionNet, and End2EndNet. Representative works
within each category are reviewed and compared, with benchmarking results
across commonly used datasets. Finally, we explore the extended applications of
emotion recognition in mental health assessment, such as detecting depression
and autism, and discuss the open challenges and future research directions in
this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: ViGText integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) text explanations in a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection, achieving superior generalization and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of deepfake technology threatens media authenticity, and traditional detection methods struggle with generalization and robustness against sophisticated attacks.

Method: ViGText divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates them using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for analysis, leveraging multi-level feature extraction.

Result: ViGText boosts F1 scores from 72.45% to 98.32% in generalization and improves recall by 11.1%, with minimal performance degradation under attacks.

Conclusion: ViGText sets a new standard for deepfake detection by combining visual and textual analysis, enhancing media authenticity and information integrity.

Abstract: The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but
fraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional
deepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized
deepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against
malicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that
integrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations
within a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of
ViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as
it provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack
specificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically
divides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates
them for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.
Through the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency
domains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to
detect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText
significantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost
when it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise
from 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's
superior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable
diffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in
recall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted
attacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits
classification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed
visual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,
helping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Transition-Aware Video (TAV) dataset to improve AI-generated video models' ability to handle multi-scene transitions, addressing limitations in current text-to-video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated video models perform well for single-scene clips but struggle with longer videos requiring coherent scene transitions due to lack of transition awareness.

Method: The authors propose the TAV dataset, consisting of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene transitions, and demonstrate its effectiveness through post-training experiments.

Result: Post-training on TAV improves scene transition understanding, reduces the gap between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Conclusion: The TAV dataset enhances multi-scene video generation by enabling models to detect and segment transitions effectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated video have shown strong performance on
\emph{text-to-video} tasks, particularly for short clips depicting a single
scene. However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent
scene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is
needed from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets
consisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn
and respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition
awareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to
identify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting
transitions.
  To address this, we propose the \textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)
dataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene
transitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \textbf{TAV}
dataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap
between required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BokehDiff is a new lens blur rendering method using generative diffusion prior for accurate and visually appealing results, overcoming depth estimation limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods suffer from artifacts due to inaccurate depth estimation, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: Uses a physics-inspired self-attention module with depth-dependent constraints and adapts diffusion models for one-step inference.

Result: Achieves high-quality, artifact-free blur rendering with improved fidelity.

Conclusion: BokehDiff effectively addresses depth-related artifacts and data scarcity by leveraging diffusion models for realistic results.

Abstract: We introduce BokehDiff, a novel lens blur rendering method that achieves
physically accurate and visually appealing outcomes, with the help of
generative diffusion prior. Previous methods are bounded by the accuracy of
depth estimation, generating artifacts in depth discontinuities. Our method
employs a physics-inspired self-attention module that aligns with the image
formation process, incorporating depth-dependent circle of confusion constraint
and self-occlusion effects. We adapt the diffusion model to the one-step
inference scheme without introducing additional noise, and achieve results of
high quality and fidelity. To address the lack of scalable paired data, we
propose to synthesize photorealistic foregrounds with transparency with
diffusion models, balancing authenticity and scene diversity.

*Xiaoran Sun,Liyan Wang,Cong Wang,Yeying Jin,Kin-man Lam,Zhixun Su,Yang Yang,Jinshan Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-IMI is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) that uses vision-language models (VLMs) and iterative manual instructions (IMIs) to incorporate semantic guidance from normal-light images, improving performance in complex lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLIE methods lack semantic guidance from normal-light images, limiting their effectiveness in complex lighting scenarios.

Method: VLM-IMI leverages VLMs with IMIs, using textual descriptions of normal-light content as enhancement cues. It includes an instruction prior fusion module to align and fuse image-text features dynamically.

Result: VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, especially in extremely low-light conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates semantic guidance and iterative refinement, achieving superior LLIE performance.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods rely on pre-trained
model priors, low-light inputs, or both, while neglecting the semantic guidance
available from normal-light images. This limitation hinders their effectiveness
in complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel
framework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and
manual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions
of the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically
informed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce
an instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image
and text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically
coherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual
instruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving
visual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic
alignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light
conditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that
VLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and
perceptual quality. The source code is available at

TL;DR: TextSAM-EUS is a lightweight, text-driven adaptation of SAM for pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, outperforming SOTA models with minimal parameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in EUS segmentation due to speckle noise, low contrast, and reliance on expert annotations motivate a need for automated, efficient solutions.

Method: TextSAM-EUS combines BiomedCLIP text encoder with LoRA-based SAM adaptation, enabling segmentation without manual prompts, tuning only 0.86% of parameters.

Result: Achieves 82.69% Dice and 85.28% NSD with automatic prompts, surpassing SOTA models and SAM variants.

Conclusion: TextSAM-EUS provides an efficient, robust solution for EUS segmentation, pioneering prompt learning in SAM-based medical imaging.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis and relies on endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) for targeted biopsy and radiotherapy. However, the speckle
noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of
pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both
error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To
address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight,
text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no
manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt
learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in
conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable
automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total
parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas,
TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized
surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice
and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised
DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first
attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,
TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS
segmentation. Our code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping is essential for urban and resource
planning, and is one of the key elements in developing smart and sustainable
cities.This study evaluates advanced LULC mapping techniques, focusing on
Look-Up Table (LUT)-based Atmospheric Correction applied to Cartosat
Multispectral (MX) sensor images, followed by supervised and semi-supervised

enhancing pseudo-label reliability during training. This comprehensive approach
analyses the accuracy and utility of LULC mapping techniques for various urban
planning applications. A case study of Hyderabad, India, illustrates
significant land use changes due to rapid urbanization. By analyzing Cartosat
MX images over time, we highlight shifts such as urban sprawl, shrinking green
spaces, and expanding industrial areas. This demonstrates the practical utility
of these techniques for urban planners and policymakers.

Result: The approach outperforms existing models on multiple VTG benchmarks, especially in challenging and open-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: High-quality cold start data and difficulty-controlled RL are crucial for VTG performance. The framework's datasets, models, and code are released for further research.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize relevant temporal segments in
videos given natural language queries. Despite recent progress with large
vision-language models (LVLMs) and instruction-tuning, existing approaches
often suffer from limited temporal awareness and poor generalization. In this
work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve both the accuracy and
robustness of VTG models. Our approach first leverages high-quality curated
cold start data for SFT initialization, followed by difficulty-controlled RL to
further enhance temporal localization and reasoning abilities. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple VTG benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing models, particularly in challenging and open-domain
scenarios. We conduct an in-depth analysis of training strategies and dataset
curation, highlighting the importance of both high-quality cold start data and
difficulty-controlled RL. To facilitate further research and industrial
adoption, we release all intermediate datasets, models, and code to the
community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Transformer model predicts fMRI responses to multimodal movies using visual, auditory, and language inputs, achieving strong performance by leveraging temporal and multimodal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop encoding models for predicting whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal movies, addressing the challenge of capturing long-range temporal structure and individual variability.

Method: A sequence-to-sequence Transformer autoregressively predicts fMRI activity, integrating stimulus features (VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, BridgeTower) and narrative summaries via dual cross-attention. Uses shared encoder with subject-specific decoders.

Result: Strong performance on in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling.

Conclusion: The model successfully predicts brain activity by combining multimodal inputs and temporal context, offering a robust approach for fMRI response prediction.

Abstract: The Algonauts 2025 Challenge called on the community to develop encoding
models that predict whole-brain fMRI responses to naturalistic multimodal
movies. In this submission, we propose a sequence-to-sequence Transformer that
autoregressively predicts fMRI activity from visual, auditory, and language
inputs. Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including
VideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower. The decoder integrates information
from prior brain states, current stimuli, and episode-level summaries via dual
cross-attention mechanisms that attend to both perceptual information extracted
from the stimulus as well as narrative information provided by high-level
summaries of narrative content. One core innovation of our approach is the use
of sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,
enabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and
neural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial
subject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects
while accounting for individual variability. Our model achieves strong
performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, demonstrating
the effectiveness of temporally-aware, multimodal sequence modeling for brain
activity prediction. The code is available at

*JinYoung Kim,DaeUng Jo,Kimin Yun,Jeonghyo Song,Youngjoon Yoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a framework for joint modeling of distributional uncertainty and OoD detection using free energy, outperforming conventional methods like MC Dropout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for OoD detection often focus on either model or data uncertainty, lacking semantic alignment with OoD objectives.

Method: Proposes a free-energy-based density estimator (Beta distribution) and integrates it into a posterior network for direct uncertainty estimation, combined with the RPL framework.

Result: Validated on benchmarks like Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can, showing improved uncertainty-aware segmentation.

Conclusion: The method provides a semantically meaningful and efficient solution for OoD detection and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty from deep neural networks is a widely used approach
for detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) samples, which typically exhibit high
predictive uncertainty. However, conventional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC)
Dropout often focus solely on either model or data uncertainty, failing to
align with the semantic objective of OoD detection. To address this, we propose
the Free-Energy Posterior Network, a novel framework that jointly models
distributional uncertainty and identifying OoD and misclassified regions using
free energy. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a
free-energy-based density estimator parameterized by a Beta distribution, which
enables fine-grained uncertainty estimation near ambiguous or unseen regions;
and (2) a loss integrated within a posterior network, allowing direct
uncertainty estimation from learned parameters without requiring stochastic
sampling. By integrating our approach with the residual prediction branch (RPL)
framework, the proposed method goes beyond post-hoc energy thresholding and
enables the network to learn OoD regions by leveraging the variance of the Beta
distribution, resulting in a semantically meaningful and computationally
efficient solution for uncertainty-aware segmentation. We validate the
effectiveness of our method on challenging real-world benchmarks, including
Fishyscapes, RoadAnomaly, and Segment-Me-If-You-Can.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Anyang Tong,Jinyang Huang,Jie Zhang,Dan Guo,Zhi Liu,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework (HDF) for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition improves accuracy and robustness by addressing sample heterogeneity with time-frequency modeling and adaptive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods degrade under sample heterogeneity from multi-source data and individual expression variability.

Method: Proposes HDF with two modules: Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) for temporal-frequency modeling and Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) for adaptive optimization.

Result: HDF achieves superior WAR and UAR on DFEW and FERV39k datasets, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: HDF effectively addresses heterogeneity challenges, enhancing recognition accuracy and robustness in DFER.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

TL;DR: T2VWorldBench is introduced as the first framework to evaluate text-to-video models' ability to generate semantically and factually accurate content using world knowledge, revealing significant gaps in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of study on how text-to-video models leverage world knowledge for semantic consistency and factual accuracy motivated the creation of T2VWorldBench.

Method: The benchmark evaluates models across 6 categories and 1,200 prompts using human and automated (VLM-based) evaluation.

Result: Most advanced models fail to generate correct videos due to poor understanding of world knowledge.

Conclusion: The findings highlight a critical gap in current models, suggesting opportunities for improving commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable performance in generating
visually reasonable scenes, while their capability to leverage world knowledge
for ensuring semantic consistency and factual accuracy remains largely
understudied. In response to this challenge, we propose T2VWorldBench, the
first systematic evaluation framework for evaluating the world knowledge
generation abilities of text-to-video models, covering 6 major categories, 60
subcategories, and 1,200 prompts across a wide range of domains, including
physics, nature, activity, culture, causality, and object. To address both
human preference and scalable evaluation, our benchmark incorporates both human
evaluation and automated evaluation using vision-language models (VLMs). We
evaluated the 10 most advanced text-to-video models currently available,
ranging from open source to commercial models, and found that most models are
unable to understand world knowledge and generate truly correct videos. These
findings point out a critical gap in the capability of current text-to-video
models to leverage world knowledge, providing valuable research opportunities
and entry points for constructing models with robust capabilities for
commonsense reasoning and factual generation.

TL;DR: A novel entropy-based framework for quantifying curve tortuosity in medical images, validated through meibomian gland atrophy analysis, shows high clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise tortuosity quantification is crucial for diagnosing diseases, but traditional methods lack robustness when biologically plausible reference curves are available.

Method: The framework integrates probability modeling, entropy theory, and domain transformation, comparing target curves to reference curves instead of idealized straight lines.

Result: The method showed significant differences in tortuosity between patient groups (AUC 0.8768, sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.93).

Conclusion: The framework is effective for medical tortuosity analysis and has potential for broader morphological evaluations in diagnostics.

Abstract: In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve
tortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological
assessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for
tortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the
evaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative
application scenario.
  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework
that integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates
domain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as
curvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a
target curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it
is more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where
biologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust
and objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line
comparisons.
  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess
the stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was
applied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to
analyze the difference in this uniformity between \textit{Demodex}-negative and
\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a
significant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,
with an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of
0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework
in curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for
quantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.

*Jinhong He,Minglong Xue,Zhipu Liu,Mingliang Zhou,Aoxiang Ning,Palaiahnakote Shivakumara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism for low-light image enhancement improves degradation modeling and generation quality by jointly modeling low-light and normal-light degradation processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based methods struggle with real-world degradation complexity, leading to structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments.

Method: Proposes bidirectional diffusion (low-to-normal and normal-to-low light) with adaptive feature interaction (AFI) and reflection-aware correction (RACM).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantitative and qualitative evaluations, generalizing well to diverse degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: The bidirectional approach enhances degradation learning and image quality, aligning better with human visual perception.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images
to better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods
have shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.
However, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to
capture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to
structural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these
challenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that
jointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light
images, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing
generation quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from
low-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce
an adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.
By leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes
an implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise
distribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the
models ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,
we design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color
restoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content
consistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual
perception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation
scenarios. Code at https://github.com/hejh8/BidDiff

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMamba is a cross-modality fusion method for RGB and IR imagery, using DWT and IDWT for feature integration and detection, achieving a 4.5% mAP improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object detection by leveraging the complementary features of RGB and IR imagery through frequency-based fusion.

Method: Uses DWT for decomposition, WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB) for cross-band fusion, and IDWT for reconstruction. Includes Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB) and high-frequency enhancement.

Result: Surpasses state-of-the-art methods with a 4.5% average mAP improvement on four benchmarks.

Conclusion: WaveMamba effectively integrates RGB and IR features, demonstrating superior performance in object detection.

Abstract: Leveraging the complementary characteristics of visible (RGB) and infrared
(IR) imagery offers significant potential for improving object detection. In
this paper, we propose WaveMamba, a cross-modality fusion method that
efficiently integrates the unique and complementary frequency features of RGB
and IR decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). An improved detection
head incorporating the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT) is also
proposed to reduce information loss and produce the final detection results.
The core of our approach is the introduction of WaveMamba Fusion Block (WMFB),
which facilitates comprehensive fusion across low-/high-frequency sub-bands.
Within WMFB, the Low-frequency Mamba Fusion Block (LMFB), built upon the Mamba
framework, first performs initial low-frequency feature fusion with channel
swapping, followed by deep fusion with an advanced gated attention mechanism
for enhanced integration. High-frequency features are enhanced using a strategy
that applies an ``absolute maximum" fusion approach. These advancements lead to
significant performance gains, with our method surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches and achieving average mAP improvements of 4.5% on four benchmarks.

*Abhishek Kaushik,Norbert Haala,Uwe Soergel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage UDA framework for 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation uses contrastive pre-training and ensemble pseudo-labeling to address domain shifts without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in 3D LiDAR segmentation due to domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, location) is a critical issue for autonomous systems, but manual annotation is impractical.

Method: 1. Unsupervised contrastive learning pre-trains a backbone for domain-invariant features. 2. Multi-model pseudo-labeling via ensemble voting refines labels for target domain.

Result: Experiments show significant accuracy improvements over direct transfer and single-model UDA methods when adapting from SemanticKITTI to SemanticPOSS/SemanticSlamantic.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges domain gaps using contrastive pre-training and refined pseudo-labeling, eliminating the need for target domain annotations.

Abstract: Addressing performance degradation in 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation due to
domain shifts (e.g., sensor type, geographical location) is crucial for
autonomous systems, yet manual annotation of target data is prohibitive. This
study addresses the challenge using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) and
introduces a novel two-stage framework to tackle it. Initially, unsupervised
contrastive learning at the segment level is used to pre-train a backbone
network, enabling it to learn robust, domain-invariant features without labels.
Subsequently, a multi-model pseudo-labeling strategy is introduced, utilizing
an ensemble of diverse state-of-the-art architectures (including projection,
voxel, hybrid, and cylinder-based methods). Predictions from these models are
aggregated via hard voting to generate high-quality, refined pseudo-labels for
the unlabeled target domain, mitigating single-model biases. The contrastively
pre-trained network is then fine-tuned using these robust pseudo-labels.
Experiments adapting from SemanticKITTI to unlabeled target datasets
(SemanticPOSS, SemanticSlamantic) demonstrate significant improvements in
segmentation accuracy compared to direct transfer and single-model UDA
approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining contrastive
pre-training with refined ensemble pseudo-labeling for bridging complex domain
gaps without requiring target domain annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff-UMamba, a UNet-mamba hybrid with a Noise Reduction Module, improves medical image segmentation by filtering noise and enhancing task-relevant features, achieving 1-5% gains in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models overfit in data-scarce scenarios, limiting generalization. Medical image segmentation needs robust solutions for noisy or limited data.

Method: Combines UNet with mamba for long-range dependencies and introduces a Noise Reduction Module (NRM) to suppress irrelevant activations.

Result: Achieves 1-3% gains on public datasets (MSD, AIIB23) and 4-5% on NSCLC CBCT segmentation, showing robustness in low-data settings.

Conclusion: Diff-UMamba enhances segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in data-scarce medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and
irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen
samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we
introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework
with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of
Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal
differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the
encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance
task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically
meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved
segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings.
Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and
pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over
baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess
performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted
on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training
samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam
CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Phan Nguyen Duc Hieu,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatSSL is a self-supervised learning architecture for micrograph analysis, outperforming supervised methods and other SSL approaches with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised methods for micrograph analysis require retraining for new datasets and perform poorly with limited labels. SSL alternatives often need large datasets. MatSSL aims to address these issues.

Method: MatSSL uses Gated Feature Fusion for multi-level representation integration. It pretrains on small unlabeled data and fine-tunes on benchmarks.

Result: Achieves 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM (vs. 66.73% ImageNet-pretrained) and up to 40% improvement on EBC dataset.

Conclusion: MatSSL adapts effectively to metallography with minimal unlabeled data, retaining transferable features from large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: MatSSL is a streamlined self-supervised learning (SSL) architecture that
employs Gated Feature Fusion at each stage of the backbone to integrate
multi-level representations effectively. Current micrograph analysis of
metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for
each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled
samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data,
most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective.
MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform
self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then
fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation
models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an
ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40%
improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark
dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that
MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a
small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable
features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.

*Minghao Fu,Guo-Hua Wang,Xiaohao Chen,Qing-Guo Chen,Zhao Xu,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeEFusion is a distillation method that simplifies text-to-image synthesis by fusing text embeddings, reducing inference costs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs due to CFG's reliance on two forward passes and complex sampling strategies.

Method: TeEFusion distills the teacher model's sampling strategy by fusing conditional and unconditional text embeddings linearly, avoiding extra parameters.

Result: Student model achieves 6x faster inference speeds while matching teacher model's image quality.

Conclusion: TeEFusion offers an efficient alternative to complex sampling strategies without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated
sampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality
generation. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when
combined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high
inference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\textbf{Te}xt
\textbf{E}mbeddings \textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method
that directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and
distills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing
conditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,
TeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,
simultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output
produced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on
state-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the
student to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more
efficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference
speeds up to 6$\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image
quality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex
sampling approach. The code is publicly available at

*Qilin Huang,Tianyu Lin,Zhiguang Chen,Fudan Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LEAF improves medical image segmentation by adapting diffusion models to directly predict segmentation maps and using feature distillation, enhancing performance without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for medical image segmentation lack task-specific adjustments and have feature extraction deficiencies.

Method: LEAF replaces noise prediction with direct segmentation map prediction and uses feature distillation to align convolutional and transformer-based features.

Result: LEAF outperforms original diffusion models on multiple segmentation datasets without increasing parameters or computation.

Conclusion: LEAF efficiently enhances segmentation performance by fine-tuning diffusion models and aligning features, maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful capabilities of diffusion models has yielded quite
effective results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, existing
methods typically transfer the original training process directly without
specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used
pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction.
Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation
model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we
replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the
segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We
also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the
convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of
the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for
different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model
architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation
during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.

TL;DR: GSDTTA introduces a graph spectral domain approach for efficient 3D point cloud test-time adaptation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and computational cost of current 3D TTA methods due to irregular point cloud structures.

Method: Uses Graph Fourier Transform to shift adaptation to the spectral domain, optimizing low-frequency components and employing eigenmap-guided self-training.

Result: Outperforms existing TTA methods in 3D point cloud classification, as shown by experiments and ablation studies.

Conclusion: GSDTTA offers a more efficient and effective solution for 3D point cloud adaptation in the spectral domain.

Abstract: While test-time adaptation (TTA) methods effectively address domain shifts by
dynamically adapting pre-trained models to target domain data during online
inference, their application to 3D point clouds is hindered by their irregular
and unordered structure. Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally
expensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training
data. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation
(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts
adaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by
capturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in
target domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into
graph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,
adaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency
components, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse
GFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the
graph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an
eigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the
spectral adjustments and the model parameters. Experimental results and
ablation studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GSDTTA,
outperforming existing TTA methods for 3D point cloud classification.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network to address domain gaps and temporal misalignment in collaborative perception, improving feature fusion quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature-level fusion in collaborative perception is hindered by domain gaps from hardware diversity and temporal misalignment from delays, degrading feature quality.

Method: Proposes DATA network with Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM), Progressive Temporal Alignment Module (PTAM), and Instance-focused Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets, robust to communication delays and pose errors.

Conclusion: DATA effectively aligns features and enhances semantic representations for improved collaborative perception.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through
balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its
effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of
high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment
conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These
challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the
collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment
(DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing
their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a
Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps
through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained
discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module
(PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and
two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused
Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic
representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness
with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at

TL;DR: DepthDark is a robust foundation model for monocular depth estimation in low-light conditions, addressing dataset and fine-tuning challenges with innovative simulation modules and PEFT strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monocular depth estimation models perform poorly in low-light environments due to lack of specialized datasets and fine-tuning methods.

Method: Proposes DepthDark with flare- and noise-simulation modules for dataset creation and a PEFT strategy using illumination guidance and multiscale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets with limited data and resources.

Conclusion: DepthDark effectively addresses low-light depth estimation challenges, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have
received increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight
conditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light
environments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth
estimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems
from the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for
low-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
strategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust
foundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a
flare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate
the imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired
depth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective
low-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale
feature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the
challenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its
effectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.

TL;DR: LONG3R is a novel model for real-time streaming multi-view 3D scene reconstruction over long sequences, outperforming existing methods with its memory gating and dual-source decoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view scene reconstruction struggle with real-time processing of long sequences, either being too slow or limited to shorter sequences.

Method: LONG3R uses a memory gating mechanism, a dual-source refined decoder, and a 3D spatio-temporal memory for dynamic pruning and resolution adjustment. It employs a two-stage curriculum training strategy.

Result: LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, especially for long sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed.

Conclusion: LONG3R addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering efficient and real-time 3D reconstruction for long sequences.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-view scene reconstruction have been significant,
yet existing methods face limitations when processing streams of input images.
These methods either rely on time-consuming offline optimization or are
restricted to shorter sequences, hindering their applicability in real-time
scenarios. In this work, we propose LONG3R (LOng sequence streaming 3D
Reconstruction), a novel model designed for streaming multi-view 3D scene
reconstruction over longer sequences. Our model achieves real-time processing
by operating recurrently, maintaining and updating memory with each new
observation. We first employ a memory gating mechanism to filter relevant
memory, which, together with a new observation, is fed into a dual-source
refined decoder for coarse-to-fine interaction. To effectively capture
long-sequence memory, we propose a 3D spatio-temporal memory that dynamically
prunes redundant spatial information while adaptively adjusting resolution
along the scene. To enhance our model's performance on long sequences while
maintaining training efficiency, we employ a two-stage curriculum training
strategy, each stage targeting specific capabilities. Experiments demonstrate
that LONG3R outperforms state-of-the-art streaming methods, particularly for
longer sequences, while maintaining real-time inference speed. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ISTD methods rely on expensive manual-labeling data, making them fragile in real-world scenarios with scarce high-quality infrared data.

Method: Proposes Gaussian Group Squeezer for non-uniform quantization and two-stage diffusion models for real-world reconstruction to align quantized signals with real-world distributions.

Result: The approach enhances ISTD model resilience and synthetic sample quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in scarcity scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses data scarcity challenges in ISTD, improving detection performance and robustness.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) plays a vital role in numerous
practical applications. In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,
researchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation
learning. Nevertheless, this approach renders the state-of-the-art ISTD methods
highly fragile in real-world challenges. In this paper, we first study the
variation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under
various scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that
challenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this
concern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.
Specifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian
sampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse
array of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against
various challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for
real-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with
real-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of
the synthetic samples. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art
detection methods in various scarcity scenarios demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed approach.

TL;DR: The study uses Mendelian randomization to explore causal links between dental traits (caries, periodontitis) and lung cancer, finding caries increases lung cancer risk, mediated by lung function decline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify uncertain causal relationships between oral diseases (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes.

Method: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) with genetic instruments from large GWAS datasets, using inverse variance weighting and delta method for mediation analysis.

Result: Dental caries significantly increases lung cancer risk (especially squamous cell carcinoma), mediated by declines in FVC and FEV1. No effect from periodontitis.

Conclusion: Dental caries causally affects lung cancer risk, suggesting dental care and lung function monitoring should be part of cancer prevention.

Abstract: Periodontitis and dental caries are common oral diseases affecting billions
globally. While observational studies suggest links between these conditions
and lung cancer, causality remains uncertain. This study used two sample
Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental
traits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess
mediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the
largest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823
dental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from
the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance
weighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed
using the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect
of dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one
standard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a
188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =

*Jincheng Li,Chunyu Xie,Ji Ao,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMM-Det is a novel approach using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for object detection without specialized modules, improving recall via data distribution adjustment and inference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap between LMMs and specialist detectors in object detection tasks.

Method: Proposes LMM-Det, leveraging LMMs for detection by adjusting data distribution and optimizing inference, without specialized modules.

Result: Experiments show LMM-Det effectively enhances object detection capabilities in LMMs.

Conclusion: LMMs can perform object detection without extra modules, validated by LMM-Det's success.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have garnered wide-spread attention and
interest within the artificial intelligence research and industrial
communities, owing to their remarkable capability in multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and in-context learning, among others. While LMMs have demonstrated
promising results in tackling multimodal tasks like image captioning, visual
question answering, and visual grounding, the object detection capabilities of
LMMs exhibit a significant gap compared to specialist detectors. To bridge the
gap, we depart from the conventional methods of integrating heavy detectors
with LMMs and propose LMM-Det, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a
Large Multimodal Model for vanilla object Detection without relying on
specialized detection modules. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive
exploratory analysis when a large multimodal model meets with object detection,
revealing that the recall rate degrades significantly compared with specialist
detection models. To mitigate this, we propose to increase the recall rate by
introducing data distribution adjustment and inference optimization tailored
for object detection. We re-organize the instruction conversations to enhance
the object detection capabilities of large multimodal models. We claim that a
large multimodal model possesses detection capability without any extra
detection modules. Extensive experiments support our claim and show the
effectiveness of the versatile LMM-Det. The datasets, models, and codes are

*Xiaomei Zhang,Hanyu Zheng,Xiangyu Zhu,Jinghuan Wei,Junhong Zou,Zhen Lei,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FieldLVLM improves LVLMs' understanding of scientific field data using field-aware language generation and data-compressed multimodal tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs lack effectiveness in interpreting complex scientific field data, limiting their application in natural sciences.

Method: FieldLVLM combines field-aware language generation (extracting key features into structured text) and data-compressed multimodal tuning (reducing input complexity).

Result: FieldLVLM outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets for scientific field data tasks.

Conclusion: FieldLVLM bridges the gap between LVLMs and domain-specific scientific research, enabling new applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
across a range of tasks that integrate visual and textual understanding, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. These models are trained on
large-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge
visual perception and natural language processing. However, their application
to scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly
used in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
FieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'
understanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a
field-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model
tuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a
special-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from
field data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.
This information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that
serve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on
LVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to
reduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative
values. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides
its learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods
in tasks involving scientific field data. Our findings suggest that this
approach opens up new possibilities for applying large vision-language models
to scientific research, helping bridge the gap between large models and
domain-specific discovery.

*Minje Park,Jeonghwa Lim,Taehyung Yu,Sunghoon Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks semi-supervised learning for ECG delineation, comparing transformer and convolutional networks, with the transformer outperforming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG delineation lacks annotated datasets; semi-supervised learning leverages unlabeled data to address this.

Method: Curated public datasets, implemented five SemiSeg algorithms on convolutional and transformer architectures, and proposed ECG-specific configurations.

Result: Transformer outperformed convolutional networks in semi-supervised ECG delineation.

Conclusion: The benchmark aids future research in semi-supervised ECG delineation.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform
features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using
deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available
annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by
leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present the first
systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG
delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including
previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We
adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision,
implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and
the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and
cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and
augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our
results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in
semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that our benchmark will serve as
a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will
facilitate further research in this domain.

*Jiangjun Peng,Yisi Luo,Xiangyong Cao,Shuang Xu,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new Modified Nuclear Norm (MNN) framework is introduced for matrix recovery, capturing both local and global low-rank structures without parameter tuning, with proven recovery guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to jointly capture local and global low-rank structures without trade-offs. The MNN framework addresses this gap.

Method: MNN applies transformations to the matrix before using the nuclear norm, enabling joint local-global low-rank recovery. Theoretical guarantees are provided.

Result: MNN outperforms existing methods in Robust PCA and matrix completion, with exact recovery guarantees under mild assumptions.

Conclusion: MNN offers a unified, flexible, and effective approach for structured low-rank recovery, validated by experiments.

Abstract: The nuclear norm (NN) has been widely explored in matrix recovery problems,
such as Robust PCA and matrix completion, leveraging the inherent global
low-rank structure of the data. In this study, we introduce a new modified
nuclear norm (MNN) framework, where the MNN family norms are defined by
adopting suitable transformations and performing the NN on the transformed
matrix. The MNN framework offers two main advantages: (1) it jointly captures
both local information and global low-rankness without requiring trade-off
parameter tuning; (2) Under mild assumptions on the transformation, we provided
exact theoretical recovery guarantees for both Robust PCA and MC tasks-an
achievement not shared by existing methods that combine local and global
information. Thanks to its general and flexible design, MNN can accommodate
various proven transformations, enabling a unified and effective approach to
structured low-rank recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Code and supplementary material are available at

*Gabriel Jarry,Ramon Dalmau,Philippe Very,Franck Ballerini,Stephania-Denisa Bocu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GVCCS, a ground-based dataset for tracking contrails, and a deep learning framework for contrail analysis to improve climate impact models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrails significantly impact aviation's climate effects, but current models lack accurate data and tracking. Observational data is needed to validate and enhance these models.

Method: The authors present GVCCS, a dataset of contrails recorded with a ground camera, and propose a deep learning framework for contrail segmentation and tracking.

Result: The dataset includes 122 video sequences with labeled and tracked contrails, and the deep learning model performs semantic and instance segmentation with temporal tracking.

Conclusion: GVCCS and the proposed framework improve contrail monitoring and model calibration, aiding better climate impact assessments.

Abstract: Aviation's climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also
significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can
alter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of
aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail
formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality
of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex
processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.
Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,
could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing
datasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they
typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their
source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible
Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded
with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is
individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its
lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and
includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As
reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail
analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic
segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual
contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By
providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for
model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will
facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for
more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.

TL;DR: SGCDet is a multi-view indoor 3D object detection framework using adaptive 3D volume construction and geometry-aware aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance without ground-truth scene geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D object detection by dynamically integrating geometric and contextual information from multiple views and reducing redundant computations in free space.

Method: Introduces a geometry and context-aware aggregation module and a sparse volume construction strategy for adaptive feature refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ARKitScenes datasets.

Conclusion: SGCDet offers an efficient and adaptive solution for indoor 3D object detection, eliminating reliance on ground-truth scene geometry.

Abstract: This work presents SGCDet, a novel multi-view indoor 3D object detection
framework based on adaptive 3D volume construction. Unlike previous approaches
that restrict the receptive field of voxels to fixed locations on images, we
introduce a geometry and context aware aggregation module to integrate
geometric and contextual information within adaptive regions in each image and
dynamically adjust the contributions from different views, enhancing the
representation capability of voxel features. Furthermore, we propose a sparse
volume construction strategy that adaptively identifies and selects voxels with
high occupancy probabilities for feature refinement, minimizing redundant
computation in free space. Benefiting from the above designs, our framework
achieves effective and efficient volume construction in an adaptive way. Better
still, our network can be supervised using only 3D bounding boxes, eliminating
the dependence on ground-truth scene geometry. Experimental results demonstrate
that SGCDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet, ScanNet200
and ARKitScenes datasets. The source code is available at

*Ezhini Rasendiran R,Chandresh Kumar Maurya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to classify bird species using their songs by visualizing pitch patterns, speed, and repetition (motifs) and enhancing spectrograms with color additives to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with bird song classification due to noise, overlapping vocalizations, and missing labels, especially in low-SNR or multi-species recordings.

Method: The approach visualizes bird song motifs (pitch, speed, repetition) and embeds frequency information into spectrograms using primary color additives to enhance species distinction.

Result: The method outperforms existing models, including the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, with improvements of 7.3% in F1, 6.2% in ROC-AUC, and 6.6% in CMAP.

Conclusion: Incorporating frequency information via colorization effectively improves bird species classification accuracy.

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying bird species using their song
recordings, a challenging task due to environmental noise, overlapping
vocalizations, and missing labels. Existing models struggle with low-SNR or
multi-species recordings. We hypothesize that birds can be classified by
visualizing their pitch pattern, speed, and repetition, collectively called
motifs. Deep learning models applied to spectrogram images help, but similar
motifs across species cause confusion. To mitigate this, we embed frequency
information into spectrograms using primary color additives. This enhances
species distinction and improves classification accuracy. Our experiments show
that the proposed approach achieves statistically significant gains over models
without colorization and surpasses the BirdCLEF 2024 winner, improving F1 by
7.3%, ROC-AUC by 6.2%, and CMAP by 6.6%. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of incorporating frequency information via colorization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoExoBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on cross-view reasoning between egocentric and exocentric viewpoints, revealing their limitations in semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human intelligence excels at transferring knowledge between first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric) viewpoints, but MLLMs' ability in this area remains unexplored.

Method: The authors introduce EgoExoBench, a benchmark with over 7,300 question-answer pairs across 11 sub-tasks, organized into three challenges: semantic alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. They evaluate 13 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs perform well on single-view tasks but struggle with cross-view reasoning, particularly in aligning semantics, associating viewpoints, and inferring temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: EgoExoBench is a valuable resource for advancing research on embodied agents and intelligent assistants with human-like cross-view intelligence.

Abstract: Transferring and integrating knowledge across first-person (egocentric) and
third-person (exocentric) viewpoints is intrinsic to human intelligence,
enabling humans to learn from others and convey insights from their own
experiences. Despite rapid progress in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), their ability to perform such cross-view reasoning remains unexplored.
To address this, we introduce EgoExoBench, the first benchmark for
egocentric-exocentric video understanding and reasoning. Built from publicly
available datasets, EgoExoBench comprises over 7,300 question-answer pairs
spanning eleven sub-tasks organized into three core challenges: semantic
alignment, viewpoint association, and temporal reasoning. We evaluate 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs and find that while these models excel on single-view
tasks, they struggle to align semantics across perspectives, accurately
associate views, and infer temporal dynamics in the ego-exo context. We hope
EgoExoBench can serve as a valuable resource for research on embodied agents
and intelligent assistants seeking human-like cross-view intelligence.

Result: Provides a unified environment for evaluating and comparing bias mitigation techniques, promoting reproducibility.

Conclusion: VB-Mitigator accelerates fairness-aware research by offering a foundational codebase and best practices for evaluation.

Abstract: Bias in computer vision models remains a significant challenge, often
resulting in unfair, unreliable, and non-generalizable AI systems. Although
research into bias mitigation has intensified, progress continues to be
hindered by fragmented implementations and inconsistent evaluation practices.
Disparate datasets and metrics used across studies complicate reproducibility,
making it difficult to fairly assess and compare the effectiveness of various
approaches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Visual Bias
Mitigator (VB-Mitigator), an open-source framework designed to streamline the
development, evaluation, and comparative analysis of visual bias mitigation
techniques. VB-Mitigator offers a unified research environment encompassing 12
established mitigation methods, 7 diverse benchmark datasets. A key strength of
VB-Mitigator is its extensibility, allowing for seamless integration of
additional methods, datasets, metrics, and models. VB-Mitigator aims to
accelerate research toward fairness-aware computer vision models by serving as
a foundational codebase for the research community to develop and assess their
approaches. To this end, we also recommend best evaluation practices and
provide a comprehensive performance comparison among state-of-the-art
methodologies.

*Lexuan Zhu,Yuxuan Li,Yuning Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel deformable convolutional module uses attention and feedforward networks to learn offsets, enabling global feature deformation and improved fundus blood vessel segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deformable convolutions lack the ability to capture long-distance global features, which is crucial for tasks like fundus blood vessel segmentation with complex edges.

Method: The proposed module learns sub-pixel displacement fields and warps feature maps across channels, decoupling kernel size from the learning network. It is applied in GDCUnet for segmentation.

Result: GDCUnet achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets, with ablation studies confirming the module's effectiveness in learning complex features.

Conclusion: The deformable convolutional module enhances model representation and generalization, making it suitable for machine vision tasks with complex global features.

Abstract: Deformable convolution can adaptively change the shape of convolution kernel
by learning offsets to deal with complex shape features. We propose a novel
plug and play deformable convolutional module that uses attention and
feedforward networks to learn offsets, so that the deformable patterns can
capture long-distance global features. Compared with previously existing
deformable convolutions, the proposed module learns the sub pixel displacement
field and adaptively warps the feature maps across all channels rather than
directly deforms the convolution kernel , which is equivalent to a relative
deformation of the kernel sampling grids, achieving global feature deformation
and the decoupling of kernel size and learning network. Considering that the
fundus blood vessels have globally self similar complex edges, we design a deep
learning model for fundus blood vessel segmentation, GDCUnet, based on the
proposed convolutional module. Empirical evaluations under the same
configuration and unified framework show that GDCUnet has achieved state of the
art performance on public datasets. Further ablation experiments demonstrated
that the proposed deformable convolutional module could more significantly
learn the complex features of fundus blood vessels, enhancing the model
representation and generalization capabilities.The proposed module is similar
to the interface of conventional convolution, we suggest applying it to more
machine vision tasks with complex global self similar features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic 4D content from minimal inputs remains a challenge in generative modeling.

Method: MVG4D combines multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting, using an image matrix module for coherent multi-view images and a deformation network for temporal extension.

Result: MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in metrics like CLIP-I, PSNR, and FVD, reducing flickering and enhancing details.

Conclusion: MVG4D advances efficient and controllable 4D generation, improving AR/VR experiences.

Abstract: Advances in generative modeling have significantly enhanced digital content
creation, extending from 2D images to complex 3D and 4D scenes. Despite
substantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic
4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel
framework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by
combining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,
MVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and
spatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for
downstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to
optimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal
domain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances
temporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key
challenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior
4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate
that MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and
time efficiency. Notably, it reduces flickering artifacts and sharpens
structural details across views and time, enabling more immersive AR/VR
experiences. MVG4D sets a new direction for efficient and controllable 4D
generation from minimal inputs.

*Yayuan Li,Filippos Bellos,Jason Corso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A one-stage architecture for direct pose generation from minimal context (RGB image and text) outperforms existing methods by avoiding intermediate representations and maintaining temporal coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on intermediate representations or autoregressive models, leading to degraded performance in long-term pose generation.

Method: Proposes a one-stage architecture using relative movement prediction and unified placeholder tokens to generate poses directly in continuous coordinate space.

Result: Outperforms quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term generation, on Penn Action and F-PHAB datasets.

Conclusion: The approach eliminates intermediate representations, ensuring consistent performance and better long-term pose generation.

Abstract: Current approaches to pose generation rely heavily on intermediate
representations, either through two-stage pipelines with quantization or
autoregressive models that accumulate errors during inference. This fundamental
limitation leads to degraded performance, particularly in long-term pose
generation where maintaining temporal coherence is crucial. We propose a novel
one-stage architecture that directly generates poses in continuous coordinate
space from minimal context - a single RGB image and text description - while
maintaining consistent distributions between training and inference. Our key
innovation is eliminating the need for intermediate representations or
token-based generation by operating directly on pose coordinates through a
relative movement prediction mechanism that preserves spatial relationships,
and a unified placeholder token approach that enables single-forward generation
with identical behavior during training and inference. Through extensive
experiments on Penn Action and First-Person Hand Action Benchmark (F-PHAB)
datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
quantization-based and autoregressive methods, especially in long-term
generation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces OpenHumanBRDF, a high-quality dataset for full-body human inverse rendering, and HumanMaterial, a model with progressive training to improve material estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task of inverse rendering is ill-posed due to lack of constraints on material maps. Existing methods use simplified data, limiting realism, especially for skin.

Method: Constructed OpenHumanBRDF dataset with detailed materials (e.g., displacement, subsurface scattering). Designed HumanMaterial with progressive training and Controlled PBR Rendering (CPR) loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on OpenHumanBRDF and real data.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model enhance realism in human rendering, particularly for skin, by addressing material estimation challenges.

Abstract: Full-body Human inverse rendering based on physically-based rendering aims to
acquire high-quality materials, which helps achieve photo-realistic rendering
under arbitrary illuminations. This task requires estimating multiple material
maps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of
constraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.
Previous works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for
training, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to
rendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further
alleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)
based on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the
normal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and
subsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially
for the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using
an end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance
among various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we
design a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full
use of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the
performance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial
material results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a
finetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map
has different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled
PBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be
optimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on
OpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: To overcome Swin Transformer's limitation of needing two blocks for global attention and enable direct fine-tuning across resolutions.

Method: Combines interleaved window attention and depthwise separable convolution for global-local token interaction in a single module.

Result: Achieves 87.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, excels in segmentation and video tasks, and works as a standalone module for image generation.

Conclusion: Iwin Transformer is a competitive alternative to Swin, with potential for future research in video generation and beyond.

Abstract: We introduce Iwin Transformer, a novel position-embedding-free hierarchical
vision transformer, which can be fine-tuned directly from low to high
resolution, through the collaboration of innovative interleaved window
attention and depthwise separable convolution. This approach uses attention to
connect distant tokens and applies convolution to link neighboring tokens,
enabling global information exchange within a single module, overcoming Swin
Transformer's limitation of requiring two consecutive blocks to approximate
global attention. Extensive experiments on visual benchmarks demonstrate that
Iwin Transformer exhibits strong competitiveness in tasks such as image
classification (87.4 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K), semantic segmentation and
video action recognition. We also validate the effectiveness of the core
component in Iwin as a standalone module that can seamlessly replace the
self-attention module in class-conditional image generation. The concepts and

Motivation: Existing deep networks integrating connectivity lack standardized mechanisms to quantify feature strengths, leading to coupled feature spaces.

Method: Proposes DCFFSNet with a feature space decoupling strategy and dynamic multi-scale feature balancing.

Result: Outperforms top models on ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets, improving Dice and IoU scores.

Conclusion: DCFFSNet resolves segmentation fragmentation and enhances clinical usability with smooth edge transitions.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to
enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep
networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional
feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized
mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we
propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It
introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy
quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other
features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation
architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature
expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg
datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by
1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice)
and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU).
The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods
across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and
achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical
usability.

*Edward Ellis,Robert Mendel,Andrew Bulpitt,Nasim Parsa,Michael F Byrne,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using V-JEPA, a self-supervised learning framework, for ultrasound video segmentation, enhancing it with a 3D localization task to improve ViT performance on small medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in acquiring and annotating large ultrasound datasets due to noise and artefacts motivate the use of SSL to leverage unlabelled data for better segmentation with limited annotations.

Method: Adopts V-JEPA for ultrasound video data, introduces a 3D localization auxiliary task to enhance ViT locality during pre-training.

Result: V-JEPA with the auxiliary task improves segmentation performance, with gains up to 3.4% (100% data) and 8.35% (10% data).

Conclusion: The study successfully applies V-JEPA to ultrasound data, demonstrating significant performance improvements, especially with limited training data.

Abstract: Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging
due to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process
requires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning
(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful
representations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data
is limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include
V-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level
reconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited
to ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail
while effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.
Similar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is
well-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small
medical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and
absence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we
propose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT
representations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our
auxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various
frozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\% using 100\% and up to
8.35\% using only 10\% of the training data.

*Mahdi Ghafourian,Federico M. Sukno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes NLML-HPE, a deep learning method for head pose estimation using tensor decomposition and neural networks, addressing data annotation issues and achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head pose estimation is vital for applications like human-computer interaction, but existing datasets often have inaccurate annotations, and traditional methods lack efficiency with limited data.

Method: Combines tensor decomposition (Tucker) and neural networks to model pose angles as regression, using cosine curves for manifold learning. Generates precise 2D data from 3D models.

Result: Achieves real-time performance and accurate pose estimation with limited training data by learning rotation manifolds from facial landmarks.

Conclusion: NLML-HPE effectively addresses annotation inaccuracies and data limitations, offering a fast and accurate solution for head pose estimation.

Abstract: Head pose estimation (HPE) plays a critical role in various computer vision
applications such as human-computer interaction and facial recognition. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with
limited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This
method is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker
decomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional
classification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as
a regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation
of pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each
Euler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension
of the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.
Almost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.
Hence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our
training set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering
the corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited
training data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an
object from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around
each axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our
training and testing code is available online along with our trained models:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework combining Dual-Scale-Former (DSFormer) and block clustering improves Visual Place Recognition (VPR) by enhancing feature representation and optimizing dataset organization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VPR struggles with reliability under varying conditions and viewpoints. The goal is to improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: Integrates DSFormer (Transformer-based cross-learning) with block clustering on the SF-XL dataset to enhance feature representation and data organization.

Result: Achieves top performance on benchmarks, reduces training data by 30%, and improves computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, efficient solution for VPR, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is crucial for robust mobile robot
localization, yet it faces significant challenges in maintaining reliable
performance under varying environmental conditions and viewpoints. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that integrates Dual-Scale-Former
(DSFormer), a Transformer-based cross-learning module, with an innovative block
clustering strategy. DSFormer enhances feature representation by enabling
bidirectional information transfer between dual-scale features extracted from
the final two CNN layers, capturing both semantic richness and spatial details
through self-attention for long-range dependencies within each scale and shared
cross-attention for cross-scale learning. Complementing this, our block
clustering strategy repartitions the widely used San Francisco eXtra Large
(SF-XL) training dataset from multiple distinct perspectives, optimizing data
organization to further bolster robustness against viewpoint variations.
Together, these innovations not only yield a robust global embedding adaptable
to environmental changes but also reduce the required training data volume by
approximately 30\% compared to previous partitioning methods. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across most benchmark datasets, surpassing advanced reranking methods like
DELG, Patch-NetVLAD, TransVPR, and R2Former as a global retrieval solution
using 512-dim global descriptors, while significantly improving computational
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PDB-Eval, a benchmark for understanding driver behavior using Large Multimodal Models (MLLMs), improving zero-shot performance by up to 73.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance driver safety systems by understanding behavior through visual evidence and aligning MLLMs with driving tasks.

Method: Introduces PDB-Eval with components PDB-X (temporal scene evaluation) and PDB-QA (visual explanation QA for fine-tuning).

Result: Fine-tuning MLLMs improves zero-shot QA performance by 73.2% and enhances intention prediction tasks by up to 12.5%.

Conclusion: PDB-Eval effectively bridges the gap between MLLMs and driving tasks, improving performance in behavior understanding and prediction.

Abstract: Understanding a driver's behavior and intentions is important for potential
risk assessment and early accident prevention. Safety and driver assistance
systems can be tailored to individual drivers' behavior, significantly
enhancing their effectiveness. However, existing datasets are limited in
describing and explaining general vehicle movements based on external visual
evidence. This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed
understanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal
Models (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists
of two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'
understanding of temporal driving scenes. Our dataset is designed to find valid
visual evidence from the external view to explain the driver's behavior from
the internal view. To align MLLMs' reasoning abilities with driving tasks, we
propose PDB-QA as a visual explanation question-answering task for MLLM
instruction fine-tuning. As a generic learning task for generative models like
MLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'
generalizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on
fine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap
between MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on
question-answering tasks by up to 73.2%. We further evaluate the MLLMs
fine-tuned on PDB-X in Brain4Cars' intention prediction and AIDE's recognition
tasks. We observe up to 12.5% performance improvements on the turn intention
prediction task in Brain4Cars, and consistent performance improvements up to
11.0% on all tasks in AIDE.

Motivation: Addressing the lack of physical realizability and reproducibility in adversarial attacks on LiDAR systems.

Method: Proposes a device-agnostic framework with open-source code and benchmarking protocols for simulation and real-world settings.

Result: Validated by successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system.

Conclusion: The framework accelerates research and improves understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a critical
research area due to its widespread application in real-world scenarios. While
many digital attacks manipulate point clouds or meshes, they often lack
physical realizability, limiting their practical impact. Physical adversarial
object attacks remain underexplored and suffer from poor reproducibility due to
inconsistent setups and hardware differences. To address this, we propose a
device-agnostic, standardized framework that abstracts key elements of physical
adversarial object attacks, supports diverse methods, and provides open-source
code with benchmarking protocols in simulation and real-world settings. Our
framework enables fair comparison, accelerates research, and is validated by
successfully transferring simulated attacks to a physical LiDAR system. Beyond
the framework, we offer insights into factors influencing attack success and
advance understanding of adversarial robustness in real-world LiDAR perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The potential of simulation for data generation in V2X scenarios is underexplored, despite its importance for autonomous driving.

Method: CRUISE uses decomposed Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct and edit real-world scenes, enabling flexible augmentation and multi-view rendering.

Result: CRUISE achieves high-fidelity scene reconstruction, enhances 3D detection and tracking, and generates challenging corner cases.

Conclusion: CRUISE effectively addresses the gap in V2X data generation and augmentation, improving autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While
simulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,
its potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains
underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive
reconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.
CRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct
real-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic
traffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for
seamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the
framework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,
enabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X
driving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across
ego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D
tracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates
challenging corner cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of anomaly detection in medical images due to diverse anomalies and lack of annotated data.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained vision models (DINO, DINOv2, Masked Autoencoder) as feature extractors, Q-Former for bottleneck, and perceptual loss for reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of pretrained vision models for medical image analysis without fine-tuning; code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is an important yet challenging task due
to the diversity of possible anomalies and the practical impossibility of
collecting comprehensively annotated data sets. In this work, we tackle
unsupervised medical anomaly detection proposing a modernized autoencoder-based
framework, the Q-Former Autoencoder, that leverages state-of-the-art pretrained
vision foundation models, such as DINO, DINOv2 and Masked Autoencoder. Instead
of training encoders from scratch, we directly utilize frozen vision foundation
models as feature extractors, enabling rich, multi-stage, high-level
representations without domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose the usage of
the Q-Former architecture as the bottleneck, which enables the control of the
length of the reconstruction sequence, while efficiently aggregating multiscale
features. Additionally, we incorporate a perceptual loss computed using
features from a pretrained Masked Autoencoder, guiding the reconstruction
towards semantically meaningful structures. Our framework is evaluated on four
diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on BraTS2021, RESC, and RSNA. Our results highlight the potential of
vision foundation model encoders, pretrained on natural images, to generalize
effectively to medical image analysis tasks without further fine-tuning. We

Abstract: Accurate detection of Plasmodium falciparum in Giemsa-stained blood smears is
an essential component of reliable malaria diagnosis, especially in developing
countries. Deep learning-based object detection methods have demonstrated
strong potential for automated Malaria diagnosis, but their adoption is limited
by the scarcity of datasets with detailed instance-level annotations. In this
work, we present an enhanced version of the publicly available NIH malaria
dataset, with detailed bounding box annotations in COCO format to support
object detection training. We validated the revised annotations by training a
Faster R-CNN model to detect infected and non-infected red blood cells, as well
as white blood cells. Cross-validation on the original dataset yielded F1
scores of up to 0.88 for infected cell detection. These results underscore the
importance of annotation volume and consistency, and demonstrate that automated
annotation refinement combined with targeted manual correction can produce
training data of sufficient quality for robust detection performance. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein-EAD is a proactive defense framework for 3D adversarial attacks, using adaptive exploration and interaction to enhance robustness in dynamic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of passive defense strategies in 3D adversarial contexts, which rely on pre-defined assumptions and lack adaptability.

Method: Leverages adaptive exploration, multi-step objective balancing accuracy and entropy minimization, and uncertainty-oriented reward shaping.

Result: Significantly reduces attack success rates while maintaining standard accuracy, with robust generalization to unseen attacks.

Conclusion: Rein-EAD is effective for real-world applications like 3D object classification, face recognition, and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in 3D environments have emerged as a critical threat to
the reliability of visual perception systems, particularly in safety-sensitive
applications such as identity verification and autonomous driving. These
attacks employ adversarial patches and 3D objects to manipulate deep neural
network (DNN) predictions by exploiting vulnerabilities within complex scenes.
Existing defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training and purification,
primarily employ passive strategies to enhance robustness. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,
limiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these
challenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a
proactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction
with the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial
contexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate
prediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes
defense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves
an uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient
policy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting
real-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating
a substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard
accuracy across diverse tasks. Notably, Rein-EAD exhibits robust generalization
to unseen and adaptive attacks, making it suitable for real-world complex
tasks, including 3D object classification, face recognition and autonomous
driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SynC is a framework for refining synthetic image-caption datasets in Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) by reassigning captions to semantically aligned images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset pruning techniques are unsuitable for synthetic data where captions are well-formed but images may misalign. SynC addresses this gap.

Method: SynC uses a one-to-many mapping strategy and cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer to reassign captions to the best-matched images in the synthetic pool.

Result: SynC improves performance across ZIC models on benchmarks like MS-COCO, Flickr30k, and NoCaps, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: SynC effectively curates synthetic data for ZIC, enhancing model training and performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets
generated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual
annotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit
semantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing
objects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption
pairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are
largely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these
methods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where
captions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate
representations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework
specifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.
Instead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning
captions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the
synthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by
initially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We
then apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best
image by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via
image-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC
consistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models
on standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art
results in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating
refined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.

Motivation: Current mapless autonomous driving approaches lack reliability in online-generated maps, and existing methods for incorporating map uncertainty into trajectory prediction lack scenario-specific insights.

Method: The authors analyze scenarios where map uncertainty benefits trajectory prediction, identify the agent's kinematic state as a key factor, and propose Proprioceptive Scenario Gating and Covariance-based Map Uncertainty for adaptive integration.

Result: The approach achieves a 23.6% improvement in trajectory prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances the synergy between online mapping and trajectory prediction, providing interpretability and outperforming previous integration strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving are moving towards mapless approaches,
where High-Definition (HD) maps are generated online directly from sensor data,
reducing the need for expensive labeling and maintenance. However, the
reliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While
incorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has
shown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide
limited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is
beneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which
mapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction
and identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic
state. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario
Gating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction
based on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,
self-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and
trajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is
advantageous and outperforming previous integration methods. Additionally, we
introduce a Covariance-based Map Uncertainty approach that better aligns with
map geometry, further improving trajectory prediction. Extensive ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 23.6%
improvement in mapless trajectory prediction performance over the
state-of-the-art method using the real-world nuScenes driving dataset. Our

Conclusion: SemBA-FAST demonstrates the potential of semantic-foveal probabilistic frameworks for real-time cognitive computing and robotics.

Abstract: In goal-directed visual tasks, human perception is guided by both top-down

directing attention efficiently. Modern research on bio-inspired computational
attention models has taken advantage of advancements in deep learning by
utilizing human scanpath data to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. In
this work, we assess the performance of SemBA-FAST, i.e. Semantic-based
Bayesian Attention for Foveal Active visual Search Tasks, a top-down framework
designed for predicting human visual attention in target-present visual search.
SemBA-FAST integrates deep object detection with a probabilistic semantic
fusion mechanism to generate attention maps dynamically, leveraging pre-trained
detectors and artificial foveation to update top-down knowledge and improve
fixation prediction sequentially. We evaluate SemBA-FAST on the COCO-Search18
benchmark dataset, comparing its performance against other scanpath prediction
models. Our methodology achieves fixation sequences that closely match human
ground-truth scanpaths. Notably, it surpasses baseline and other top-down
approaches and competes, in some cases, with scanpath-informed models. These
findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of semantic-foveal

Motivation: To enable quantitative comparison of SAE-derived features across models of different modalities and understand shared representations.

Method: Proposes a novel indicator for cross-modality comparison and a metric for feature sharedness. Studies 21 encoders of varying sizes and datasets.

Result: Reveals shared features between visual and text encoders, influenced by text pretraining, and revisits previous studies in a multimodal context.

Conclusion: The tools and findings provide deeper insights into shared representations across modalities, highlighting the role of text pretraining in feature sharing.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a powerful technique for
extracting human-interpretable features from neural networks activations.
Previous works compared different models based on SAE-derived features but
those comparisons have been restricted to models within the same modality. We
propose a novel indicator allowing quantitative comparison of models across SAE
features, and use it to conduct a comparative study of visual, textual and
multimodal encoders. We also propose to quantify the Comparative Sharedness of
individual features between different classes of models. With these two new
tools, we conduct several studies on 21 encoders of the three types, with two
significantly different sizes, and considering generalist and domain specific
datasets. The results allow to revisit previous studies at the light of
encoders trained in a multimodal context and to quantify to which extent all
these models share some representations or features. They also suggest that
visual features that are specific to VLMs among vision encoders are shared with
text encoders, highlighting the impact of text pretraining. The code is

sensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of
remote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large
geographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many
applications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human
activities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by
investigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.
We first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small
training and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance
towards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a
part-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost
initial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to
build an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates
of the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these
infrastructures in a given area at a given time.

TL;DR: The paper explores using foundation models for semantic object segmentation in cluttered scenes, focusing on vision-guided neuroprostheses. It introduces gaze-based prompts for SAM and fine-tunes it on egocentric data, achieving a 0.51 IoU improvement on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to leverage foundation models for object segmentation in cluttered, real-world scenes, specifically for vision-guided upper limb neuroprostheses.

Method: Proposes gaze fixation-based prompts to guide SAM and fine-tunes it on egocentric visual data.

Result: Achieves a 0.51-point improvement in IoU segmentation quality on the Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus.

Conclusion: The approach effectively enhances segmentation in cluttered scenes, demonstrating potential for practical applications like neuroprostheses.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of semantic object segmentation using
foundation models. We investigate whether foundation models, trained on a large
number and variety of objects, can perform object segmentation without
fine-tuning on specific images containing everyday objects, but in highly
cluttered visual scenes. The ''in the wild'' context is driven by the target
application of vision guided upper limb neuroprostheses. We propose a method
for generating prompts based on gaze fixations to guide the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) in our segmentation scenario, and fine-tune it on egocentric visual
data. Evaluation results of our approach show an improvement of the IoU
segmentation quality metric by up to 0.51 points on real-world challenging data
of Grasping-in-the-Wild corpus which is made available on the RoboFlow Platform

TL;DR: GaussianFusionOcc improves 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving by using semantic 3D Gaussians and a novel sensor fusion mechanism, enhancing precision, scalability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and safe navigation in complex environments requires reliable 3D semantic occupancy prediction, which benefits from effective multi-modal sensor fusion.

Method: The approach integrates camera, LiDAR, and radar data using modality-agnostic deformable attention to refine Gaussian properties, improving environment representation.

Result: GaussianFusionOcc outperforms state-of-the-art models in precision, scalability, and efficiency, as demonstrated by extensive testing.

Conclusion: The combination of multi-modal fusion and Gaussian representation in GaussianFusionOcc offers superior performance for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction is one of the crucial tasks of autonomous
driving. It enables precise and safe interpretation and navigation in complex
environments. Reliable predictions rely on effective sensor fusion, as
different modalities can contain complementary information. Unlike conventional
methods that depend on dense grid representations, our approach,
GaussianFusionOcc, uses semantic 3D Gaussians alongside an innovative sensor
fusion mechanism. Seamless integration of data from camera, LiDAR, and radar
sensors enables more precise and scalable occupancy prediction, while 3D
Gaussian representation significantly improves memory efficiency and inference
speed. GaussianFusionOcc employs modality-agnostic deformable attention to
extract essential features from each sensor type, which are then used to refine
Gaussian properties, resulting in a more accurate representation of the
environment. Extensive testing with various sensor combinations demonstrates
the versatility of our approach. By leveraging the robustness of multi-modal
fusion and the efficiency of Gaussian representation, GaussianFusionOcc
outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: IntentVCNet bridges the spatio-temporal gap in LVLMs for fine-grained intent-oriented video captioning by combining prompt strategies and a box adapter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs lack fine-grained spatial control in time sequences for intent-oriented video captioning.

Method: Proposes a prompt combination strategy and a parameter-efficient box adapter to enhance spatial detail modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results and runner-up in the IntentVC challenge.

Conclusion: The method effectively bridges the spatio-temporal gap, improving intent-oriented captioning in LVLMs.

Abstract: Intent-oriented controlled video captioning aims to generate targeted
descriptions for specific targets in a video based on customized user intent.
Current Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have gained strong instruction
following and visual comprehension capabilities. Although the LVLMs
demonstrated proficiency in spatial and temporal understanding respectively, it
was not able to perform fine-grained spatial control in time sequences in
direct response to instructions. This substantial spatio-temporal gap
complicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in
video. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the
temporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the
spatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives. Specifically,
we first propose a prompt combination strategy designed to enable LLM to model
the implicit relationship between prompts that characterize user intent and
video sequences. We then propose a parameter efficient box adapter that
augments the object semantic information in the global visual context so that
the visual token has a priori information about the user intent. The final
experiment proves that the combination of the two strategies can further
enhance the LVLM's ability to model spatial details in video sequences, and
facilitate the LVLMs to accurately generate controlled intent-oriented
captions. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results in several open
source LVLMs and was the runner-up in the IntentVC challenge. Our code is

TL;DR: EDA expands the design space of diffusion models by allowing arbitrary noise patterns, improving image restoration without extra computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed Gaussian noise in EDM limits image restoration by corrupting degraded images and increasing complexity.

Method: EDA introduces arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models, preserving flexibility while expanding noise pattern freedom.

Result: EDA outperforms task-specific methods in MRI bias field correction, CT metal artifact reduction, and shadow removal with just 5 sampling steps.

Conclusion: EDA advances diffusion models by enabling diverse noise patterns, achieving state-of-the-art performance in restoration tasks.

Abstract: EDM elucidates the unified design space of diffusion models, yet its fixed
noise patterns restricted to pure Gaussian noise, limit advancements in image
restoration. Our study indicates that forcibly injecting Gaussian noise
corrupts the degraded images, overextends the image transformation distance,
and increases restoration complexity. To address this problem, our proposed EDA
Elucidates the Design space of Arbitrary-noise-based diffusion models.
Theoretically, EDA expands the freedom of noise pattern while preserving the
original module flexibility of EDM, with rigorous proof that increased noise
complexity incurs no additional computational overhead during restoration. EDA
is validated on three typical tasks: MRI bias field correction (global smooth
noise), CT metal artifact reduction (global sharp noise), and natural image
shadow removal (local boundary-aware noise). With only 5 sampling steps, EDA
outperforms most task-specific methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in bias field correction and shadow removal.

TL;DR: TTS-VAR is a test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive models, improving efficiency and performance through adaptive batch sizes, clustering-based diversity search, and resampling-based potential selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of scaling visual generation models while maintaining performance, TTS-VAR offers a resource-efficient test-time scaling solution.

Method: The framework models generation as path searching, using adaptive batch sizes, clustering for structural diversity at coarse scales, and resampling with potential scores at fine scales.

Result: Experiments show an 8.7% improvement in GenEval score (0.69 to 0.75) on the Infinity model, validating the approach.

Conclusion: TTS-VAR effectively balances efficiency and quality, leveraging structural features and resampling to enhance visual generation.

Abstract: Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content
creation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.
Alternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource
efficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the
first general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)
models, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To
dynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we
first introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the
causal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical
coarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key
components: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for
evaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or
rejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain
sufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity
search. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,
enabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,
resampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using
potential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating
multi-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity
show a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights
reveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final
quality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales. Code is

TL;DR: A novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework integrates MVS priors with probabilistic Procrustes mapping, enabling accurate reconstruction and pose estimation from hundreds of outdoor images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVS models struggle with memory limits and accuracy in unposed reconstruction tasks for large image sets.

Method: Partitions images into subsets, maps submaps globally using probabilistic Procrustes, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS.

Result: Achieves accurate reconstruction and pose estimation on Waymo and KITTI datasets, setting a new state of the art.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing MVS models, enabling scalable and accurate unposed 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D
representation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and
accurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from
hundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits
and lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that
integrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping
strategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a
global space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,
we formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic
Procrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing
probabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain
correspondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within
minutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization
framework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from
confidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering
with an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling
accurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI
datasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed
image sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS
reconstruction.

TL;DR: A novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS registration is proposed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with 69.8% average precision and 2.39 mm mean registration error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative MRI registration is challenging due to modality differences. A robust, interpretable solution is needed.

Method: Patient-specific synthetic iUS volumes are generated from MRI for supervised contrastive training. A probabilistic keypoint detection and curriculum-based triplet loss are used.

Result: Achieves 69.8% average precision in keypoint matching and 2.39 mm mean registration error, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is interpretable, robust, and requires no manual initialization, advancing MRI-iUS registration.

Abstract: Intraoperative registration of real-time ultrasound (iUS) to preoperative
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains an unsolved problem due to severe
modality-specific differences in appearance, resolution, and field-of-view. To
address this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS
matching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific
matching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from
preoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a
shared descriptor space.
  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify
anatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a
curriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to
learn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and
limited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects
keypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are
then used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D
MRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with
an average precision of $69.8\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a
competitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg
benchmark.
  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is
interpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS
field-of-view variation. Code is available at

Motivation: To advance deep video content cognition and multi-modal feature representation by providing a dataset with detailed hierarchical descriptions and intent expressions, which are lacking in existing datasets.

Method: The dataset includes 103K video samples with audio and hierarchical textual descriptions (factual, abstract, intent) generated using Chain-of-Thought reasoning. It also provides annotations for subject, place, time, event, action, and intent. A gold-standard benchmark of 3K manually validated samples is established for evaluation.

Conclusion: VideoMind is a powerful benchmark for advancing deep video understanding and multi-modal alignment, with publicly available data on GitHub, HuggingFace, and OpenDataLab.

Abstract: This paper introduces VideoMind, a video-centric omni-modal dataset designed
for deep video content cognition and enhanced multi-modal feature
representation. The dataset comprises 103K video samples (3K reserved for
testing), each paired with audio and systematically detailed textual
descriptions. Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three
hierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface
to depth. It contains over 22 million words, averaging ~225 words per sample.
VideoMind's key distinction from existing datasets is its provision of intent
expressions, which require contextual integration across the entire video and
are not directly observable. These deep-cognitive expressions are generated
using a Chain-of-Thought (COT) approach, prompting the mLLM through
step-by-step reasoning. Each description includes annotations for subject,
place, time, event, action, and intent, supporting downstream recognition
tasks. Crucially, we establish a gold-standard benchmark with 3,000 manually
validated samples for evaluating deep-cognitive video understanding. We design
hybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval
metrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results
for models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released. VideoMind serves as a
powerful benchmark for fine-grained cross-modal alignment and advances fields
requiring in-depth video understanding, such as emotion and intent recognition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic, labeled images of chicken carcasses and a benchmark dataset to improve instance segmentation in poultry processing. Synthetic data significantly enhances segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated detection of chicken carcasses is crucial for quality control and efficiency, but real-world data collection and annotation are laborious. Synthetic data can address these challenges.

Method: Developed a pipeline for synthetic image generation and introduced a benchmark dataset. Evaluated synthetic data's impact on instance segmentation models.

Result: Synthetic data significantly improved segmentation performance across all tested models.

Conclusion: Synthetic data augmentation is an effective strategy to overcome data scarcity and reduce manual annotation in poultry processing automation.

Abstract: The poultry industry has been driven by broiler chicken production and has
grown into the world's largest animal protein sector. Automated detection of
chicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food
safety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing
plants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance
segmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by
the need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world
image datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,
automatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce
a new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated
specifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this
study investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation
to enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when
real annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset
with varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent
instance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly
boosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This
research underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and
effective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,
and advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for
chicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.

Motivation: To enhance the accuracy of age and gender classification for targeted advertising by leveraging shared representations in facial features.

Method: A custom CNN architecture optimized for both tasks, trained on a diverse dataset with robust pre-processing.

Result: Achieved 95% gender classification accuracy and 5.77 years mean absolute error for age estimation.

Conclusion: Identified challenges in age estimation for younger individuals, suggesting targeted data augmentation and model refinement for future work.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age
and gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the
effectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,
which leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information
present in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these
tasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to
improved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of
facial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations
in lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a
significant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a
competitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,
we analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific
challenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This
analysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement
to address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN
architectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing
valuable insights for future research.

*Nitish Shukla,Arun Ross*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for demorphing face images that overcomes limitations of existing techniques by decomposing morphs in latent space, enabling detection of unseen morph techniques and styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing demorphing methods either replicate the morph or require the same morph technique for training and testing, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed method decomposes morphs in latent space, trained on synthetic faces and tested on real faces with arbitrary morph techniques.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, producing high-fidelity demorphed images.

Conclusion: The method effectively demorphs images from unseen techniques and styles, providing robust evidence for morph attacks.

Abstract: A morph is created by combining two (or more) face images from two (or more)
identities to create a composite image that is highly similar to both
constituent identities, allowing the forged morph to be biometrically
associated with more than one individual. Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be
used to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing
- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide
additional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the
morph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the
morph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same
morph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method
decomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from
unseen morph techniques and face styles. We train our method on morphs created
from synthetic faces and test on morphs created from real faces using arbitrary
morph techniques. Our method outperforms existing methods by a considerable
margin and produces high fidelity demorphed face images.

TL;DR: DMDX improves score distillation by combining adversarial pre-training and ADM fine-tuning, outperforming DMD2 in one-step performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse in DMD caused by reverse KL divergence, ADM aligns latent predictions adversarially for better score distillation.

Method: Proposes ADM with diffusion-based discriminators and hybrid adversarial distillation in latent/pixel spaces for one-step distillation.

Result: Achieves superior one-step performance on SDXL and sets benchmarks for efficient image/video synthesis with SD3 and CogVideoX.

Conclusion: DMDX enhances distillation efficiency and performance, advancing one-step and multi-step generative models.

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation
technique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient
one-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the
reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode
collapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent
drawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework
that leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions
between real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial
manner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we
further improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with
hybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean
squared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the
distributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus
providing a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the
next stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM
fine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves
superior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU
time. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on
SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient
image and video synthesis.

TL;DR: HybridTM combines Transformer and Mamba for 3D semantic segmentation, addressing limitations of each and achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in 3D segmentation but suffer from quadratic complexity, while Mamba offers efficiency but lacks feature representation. Combining their strengths is challenging.

Method: Proposes HybridTM, a hybrid architecture integrating Transformer and Mamba, and the Inner Layer Hybrid Strategy for finer granularity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybridTM effectively combines Transformer and Mamba, demonstrating superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D
semantic segmentation through their powerful attention mechanisms, but the
quadratic complexity limits their modeling of long-range dependencies in
large-scale point clouds. While recent Mamba-based approaches offer efficient
processing with linear complexity, they struggle with feature representation
when extracting 3D features. However, effectively combining these complementary
strengths remains an open challenge in this field. In this paper, we propose
HybridTM, the first hybrid architecture that integrates Transformer and Mamba
for 3D semantic segmentation. In addition, we propose the Inner Layer Hybrid
Strategy, which combines attention and Mamba at a finer granularity, enabling
simultaneous capture of long-range dependencies and fine-grained local
features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of our HybridTM on diverse indoor and outdoor datasets.
Furthermore, our HybridTM achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet,

Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and
edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV
Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity
and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the
Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align
luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating
artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV
achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low
computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in
low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization
capabilities.

### [88] [3D Software Synthesis Guided by Constraint-Expressive Intermediate Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18625)
*Shuqing Li,Anson Y. Lam,Yun Peng,Wenxuan Wang,Michael R. Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scenethesis is a novel approach for 3D software synthesis, addressing limitations of current methods by using a domain-specific language (ScenethesisLang) to ensure traceability between user requirements and generated software.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D software generation lack granular control and struggle with spatial/semantic constraints. Scenethesis aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Scenethesis uses ScenethesisLang, a constraint-aware intermediate representation, to decompose synthesis into stages for verification, modification, and constraint satisfaction.

Result: Scenethesis captures 80% of user requirements, satisfies 90% of hard constraints, and improves visual evaluation scores by 42.8% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Scenethesis effectively addresses challenges in 3D software generation, offering fine-grained control and robust constraint handling.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental
transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile
interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work
has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as
HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software
still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation
usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control
specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to
handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.
To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel
requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal
traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis
is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a
granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural
language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a
comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of
3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification
language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D
software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis
enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic
constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis
accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%
of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.
Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual
evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.

### [89] [SIDA: Synthetic Image Driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18632)
*Ye-Chan Kim,SeungJu Cha,Si-Woo Kim,Taewhan Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDA introduces a zero-shot domain adaptation method using synthetic images to overcome limitations of text-driven approaches, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-driven zero-shot domain adaptation methods struggle with complex real-world variations and slow adaptation times.

Method: SIDA generates synthetic images via image translation, uses their style features as proxies, and employs Domain Mix and Patch Style Transfer modules for effective adaptation.

Result: SIDA achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios and significantly reduces adaptation time.

Conclusion: SIDA offers an efficient and effective solution for zero-shot domain adaptation by leveraging synthetic images and novel modules.

Abstract: Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.

*Grace Su,Sheng-Yu Wang,Aaron Hertzmann,Eli Shechtman,Jun-Yan Zhu,Richard Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for recognizing artists from images generated by text-to-image models, evaluating various methods and revealing challenges in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the controversial use of text-to-image models invoking artist names and provide a tool for responsible moderation.

Method: Created a dataset of 1.95M images from 110 artists, tested feature similarity, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.

Result: Supervised and few-shot models perform well on seen artists and complex prompts, while style descriptors excel with pronounced styles; multi-artist prompts are hardest.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights room for improvement and aids in moderating text-to-image models responsibly.

Abstract: A common and controversial use of text-to-image models is to generate
pictures by explicitly naming artists, such as "in the style of Greg
Rutkowski". We introduce a benchmark for prompted-artist recognition:
predicting which artist names were invoked in the prompt from the image alone.
The dataset contains 1.95M images covering 110 artists and spans four
generalization settings: held-out artists, increasing prompt complexity,
multiple-artist prompts, and different text-to-image models. We evaluate
feature similarity baselines, contrastive style descriptors, data attribution
methods, supervised classifiers, and few-shot prototypical networks.
Generalization patterns vary: supervised and few-shot models excel on seen
artists and complex prompts, whereas style descriptors transfer better when the
artist's style is pronounced; multi-artist prompts remain the most challenging.
Our benchmark reveals substantial headroom and provides a public testbed to
advance the responsible moderation of text-to-image models. We release the
dataset and benchmark to foster further research:

*Junfei Xiao,Ceyuan Yang,Lvmin Zhang,Shengqu Cai,Yang Zhao,Yuwei Guo,Gordon Wetzstein,Maneesh Agrawala,Alan Yuille,Lu Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Captain Cinema is a framework for generating short movies from textual descriptions, using top-down keyframe planning and bottom-up video synthesis with MM-DiT for long-context video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the creation of visually coherent and narrative-consistent short movies efficiently.

Method: Combines top-down keyframe planning for storyline coherence and bottom-up video synthesis with MM-DiT for spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: Produces high-quality, visually coherent, and narrative-consistent short movies efficiently.

Conclusion: Captain Cinema effectively automates short movie generation with strong coherence and efficiency.

Abstract: We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.
Given a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly
generates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which
ensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,
scenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.
These keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,
which supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics
between them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support
stable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,
we introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our
model is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of
interleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema
performs favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative
consistent short movies in high quality and efficiency. Project page:

*Theofanis Aravanis,Grigorios Chrimatopoulos,Mohammad Ferdows,Michalis Xenos,Efstratios Em Tzirtzilakis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Symbolic Regression (SR) is used to model 3D incompressible flow in a rectangular channel, yielding interpretable equations that match analytical solutions. A hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures physical plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between accurate prediction and understanding of flow physics in fluid mechanics.

Method: Employed PySR for SR to derive symbolic equations from simulation data, then integrated with Answer Set Programming (ASP) for physical plausibility.

Result: SR-generated equations matched analytical solutions for velocity and pressure fields. The hybrid SR/ASP framework improved reliability.

Conclusion: SR simplifies complex flows into interpretable equations, and combining SR with knowledge-representation enhances alignment with domain principles.

Abstract: Unlike conventional Machine-Learning (ML) approaches, often criticized as
"black boxes", Symbolic Regression (SR) stands out as a powerful tool for
revealing interpretable mathematical relationships in complex physical systems,
requiring no a priori assumptions about models' structures. Motivated by the
recognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow
physics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a
fundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular
channel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar
conditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were
derived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics
of the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic
velocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also
perfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,
we propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the
knowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining
the generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP. The
proposed hybrid SR/ASP framework ensures that the SR-generated symbolic
expressions are not only statistically accurate, but also physically plausible,
adhering to domain-specific principles. Overall, the study highlights two key
contributions: SR's ability to simplify complex flow behaviours into concise,
interpretable equations, and the potential of knowledge-representation
approaches to improve the reliability and alignment of data-driven SR models
with domain principles. Insights from the examined 3D channel flow pave the way
for integrating such hybrid approaches into efficient frameworks, [...] where
explainable predictions and real-time data analysis are crucial.

*SaiBarath Sundar,Pranav Satheesan,Udayaadithya Avadhanam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: I2I-STRADA introduces a structured reasoning agent for data analysis, outperforming prior systems by formalizing cognitive workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agentic systems lack structured reasoning for analytical tasks, which is crucial for real-world data analysis.

Method: I2I-STRADA models reasoning via modular sub-tasks reflecting cognitive steps like goal interpretation and adaptive execution.

Result: Outperforms prior systems in planning coherence and insight alignment on DABstep and DABench benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structured cognitive workflows are essential for effective agentic data analysis systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic systems for data analysis have emphasized
automation of insight generation through multi-agent frameworks, and
orchestration layers. While these systems effectively manage tasks like query
translation, data transformation, and visualization, they often overlook the
structured reasoning process underlying analytical thinking. Reasoning large
language models (LLMs) used for multi-step problem solving are trained as
general-purpose problem solvers. As a result, their reasoning or thinking steps
do not adhere to fixed processes for specific tasks. Real-world data analysis
requires a consistent cognitive workflow: interpreting vague goals, grounding
them in contextual knowledge, constructing abstract plans, and adapting
execution based on intermediate outcomes. We introduce I2I-STRADA
(Information-to-Insight via Structured Reasoning Agent for Data Analysis), an
agentic architecture designed to formalize this reasoning process. I2I-STRADA
focuses on modeling how analysis unfolds via modular sub-tasks that reflect the
cognitive steps of analytical reasoning. Evaluations on the DABstep and DABench
benchmarks show that I2I-STRADA outperforms prior systems in planning coherence
and insight alignment, highlighting the importance of structured cognitive
workflows in agent design for data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional advanced planning systems (APS) are costly due to consultant fees, limiting accessibility. SmartAPS aims to democratize APS usage.

Method: Built on a tool-augmented LLM, SmartAPS offers a chat interface for queries, counterfactual reasoning, recommendations, and scenario analysis.

Result: SmartAPS enables intuitive interaction with APS, reducing reliance on costly consultants.

Conclusion: SmartAPS demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance accessibility and usability of complex planning tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present intriguing opportunities to enhance user
interaction with traditional algorithms and tools in real-world applications.
An advanced planning system (APS) is a sophisticated software that leverages
optimization to help operations planners create, interpret, and modify an
operational plan. While highly beneficial, many customers are priced out of
using an APS due to the ongoing costs of consultants responsible for
customization and maintenance. To address the need for a more accessible APS
expressed by supply chain planners, we present SmartAPS, a conversational
system built on a tool-augmented LLM. Our system provides operations planners
with an intuitive natural language chat interface, allowing them to query
information, perform counterfactual reasoning, receive recommendations, and
execute scenario analysis to better manage their operation. A short video
demonstrating the system has been released: https://youtu.be/KtIrJjlDbyw

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper identifies a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning that maps to deterministic finite automata, enabling strategy synthesis without costly determinization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for qualitative timeline-based planning rely on nondeterministic automata, requiring costly determinization for strategy synthesis.

Method: The authors identify a specific fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning that can be directly mapped to deterministic finite automata. They also determine a maximal subset of Allen's relations compatible with this deterministic fragment.

Result: The identified fragment allows direct mapping to deterministic finite automata, facilitating strategy synthesis without additional determinization steps.

Conclusion: The deterministic fragment simplifies strategy synthesis in qualitative timeline-based planning and includes a maximal subset of Allen's relations.

Abstract: Qualitative timeline-based planning models domains as sets of independent,
but
  interacting, components whose behaviors over time, the timelines, are
governed
  by sets of qualitative temporal constraints (ordering relations), called
  synchronization rules.
  Its plan-existence problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete; in
  particular, PSPACE-membership has been proved via reduction to the
  nonemptiness problem for nondeterministic finite automata.
  However, nondeterministic automata cannot be directly used to synthesize
  planning strategies as a costly determinization step is needed.
  In this paper, we identify a fragment of qualitative timeline-based planning
  whose plan-existence problem can be directly mapped into the nonemptiness
  problem of deterministic finite automata, which can then
  synthesize strategies.
  In addition, we identify a maximal subset of Allen's relations that fits into
  such a deterministic fragment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage pipeline that leverages model-generated errors to enhance AI creativity, showing significant improvements in novelty, relevance, and human evaluation scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move AI beyond imitation by harnessing errors as creative assets, inspired by the idea that 'creative potential hides in failure.'

Method: Uses the E.A.R.T.H. framework (Error generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, Harness feedback) with tools like LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, and CLIP, employing a composite reward function for novelty, surprise, and relevance.

Result: Creativity scores increased by 52.5%, with outputs showing 70.4% improvement. Refined slogans were shorter, more novel, and maintained relevance. Human evaluations favored metaphorical outputs (avg. 4.09 vs. 3.99).

Conclusion: Error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances AI creativity, providing a scalable approach for human-aligned creative AI.

Abstract: How can AI move beyond imitation toward genuine creativity? This paper
proposes the E.A.R.T.H. framework, a five-stage generative pipeline that
transforms model-generated errors into creative assets through Error
generation, Amplification, Refine selection, Transform, and Harness feedback.
Drawing on cognitive science and generative modeling, we posit that "creative
potential hides in failure" and operationalize this via structured prompts,
semantic scoring, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. Implemented using
LLaMA-2-7B-Chat, SBERT, BERTScore, CLIP, BLIP-2, and Stable Diffusion, the
pipeline employs a composite reward function based on novelty, surprise, and
relevance. At the Refine stage, creativity scores increase by 52.5% (1.179 to
1.898, t = -5.56, p < 0.001), with final outputs reaching 2.010 - a 70.4%
improvement. Refined slogans are 48.4% shorter, 40.7% more novel, with only a
4.0% drop in relevance. Cross-modal tests show strong slogan-to-image alignment
(CLIPScore: 0.249; BERTScore F1: 0.816). In human evaluations, 60% of outputs
scored >= 4.0, with metaphorical slogans (avg. 4.09) outperforming literal ones
(3.99). Feedback highlights stylistic precision and emotional resonance. These
results demonstrate that error-centered, feedback-driven generation enhances
creativity, offering a scalable path toward self-evolving, human-aligned
creative AI.

Motivation: To explore whether visualizations (charts/graphs) can enhance AI systems' data analysis capabilities, similar to how they aid humans.

Method: Experiments with two vision-language models (GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5) on three analysis tasks, comparing performance with raw data, blank charts, and mismatched charts.

Result: AI systems describe datasets more precisely and accurately with scatterplots, with performance improvements linked to chart content.

Conclusion: Visualizations can benefit AI systems in data analysis, mirroring their utility for humans.

Abstract: Charts and graphs help people analyze data, but can they also be useful to AI
systems? To investigate this question, we perform a series of experiments with
two commercial vision-language models: GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5. Across three
representative analysis tasks, the two systems describe synthetic datasets more
precisely and accurately when raw data is accompanied by a scatterplot,
especially as datasets grow in complexity. Comparison with two baselines --
providing a blank chart and a chart with mismatched data -- shows that the
improved performance is due to the content of the charts. Our results are
initial evidence that AI systems, like humans, can benefit from visualization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTDE methods underutilize centralized training and lack theoretical guarantees, limiting their effectiveness in cooperative MARL.

Method: MAGPO integrates centralized guidance with decentralized execution, using an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable exploration and aligning it with decentralized policies.

Result: MAGPO outperforms CTDE baselines and matches/surpasses fully centralized approaches in 43 tasks across 6 environments.

Conclusion: MAGPO provides a principled, practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning with proven monotonic policy improvement.

Abstract: Due to practical constraints such as partial observability and limited
communication, Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has
become the dominant paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). However, existing CTDE methods often underutilize centralized training
or lack theoretical guarantees. We propose Multi-Agent Guided Policy
Optimization (MAGPO), a novel framework that better leverages centralized
training by integrating centralized guidance with decentralized execution.
MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated
exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure
deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of
monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across
6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong
CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering
a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning. Our

Motivation: The motivation is to overcome the bottleneck in AI research caused by human cognitive limits by enabling AI to autonomously innovate and validate new architectures.

Method: ASI-Arch autonomously hypothesizes, implements, trains, and validates novel neural architectures, conducting 1,773 experiments over 20,000 GPU hours.

Result: Discovered 106 state-of-the-art linear attention architectures with emergent design principles surpassing human baselines, and established a scaling law for scientific discovery.

Conclusion: ASI-Arch demonstrates the potential for autonomous AI to accelerate research, transforming progress from human-limited to computation-scalable.

Abstract: While AI systems demonstrate exponentially improving capabilities, the pace
of AI research itself remains linearly bounded by human cognitive capacity,
creating an increasingly severe development bottleneck. We present ASI-Arch,
the first demonstration of Artificial Superintelligence for AI research
(ASI4AI) in the critical domain of neural architecture discovery--a fully
autonomous system that shatters this fundamental constraint by enabling AI to
conduct its own architectural innovation. Moving beyond traditional Neural
Architecture Search (NAS), which is fundamentally limited to exploring
human-defined spaces, we introduce a paradigm shift from automated optimization
to automated innovation. ASI-Arch can conduct end-to-end scientific research in
the domain of architecture discovery, autonomously hypothesizing novel
architectural concepts, implementing them as executable code, training and
empirically validating their performance through rigorous experimentation and
past experience. ASI-Arch conducted 1,773 autonomous experiments over 20,000
GPU hours, culminating in the discovery of 106 innovative, state-of-the-art
(SOTA) linear attention architectures. Like AlphaGo's Move 37 that revealed
unexpected strategic insights invisible to human players, our AI-discovered
architectures demonstrate emergent design principles that systematically
surpass human-designed baselines and illuminate previously unknown pathways for
architectural innovation. Crucially, we establish the first empirical scaling
law for scientific discovery itself--demonstrating that architectural
breakthroughs can be scaled computationally, transforming research progress
from a human-limited to a computation-scalable process. We provide
comprehensive analysis of the emergent design patterns and autonomous research
capabilities that enabled these breakthroughs, establishing a blueprint for
self-accelerating AI systems.

TL;DR: An Agentic AI framework automates clinical data pipelines, handling structured and unstructured data, feature extraction, model selection, and preprocessing, reducing manual intervention in healthcare ML solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and labor-intensive workflows in healthcare ML due to fragmented preprocessing, model compatibility issues, and data privacy constraints.

Method: Modular, task-specific agents automate data ingestion, anonymization, feature extraction, model selection, preprocessing, and inference. Evaluated on geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy datasets.

Result: Automated pipeline reduces expert intervention, offering scalable, cost-efficient AI operationalization in clinical settings.

Conclusion: The framework streamlines ML deployment in healthcare, addressing key challenges like privacy and workflow fragmentation.

Abstract: Building and deploying machine learning solutions in healthcare remains
expensive and labor-intensive due to fragmented preprocessing workflows, model
compatibility issues, and stringent data privacy constraints. In this work, we
introduce an Agentic AI framework that automates the entire clinical data
pipeline, from ingestion to inference, through a system of modular,
task-specific agents. These agents handle both structured and unstructured
data, enabling automatic feature selection, model selection, and preprocessing
recommendation without manual intervention. We evaluate the system on publicly
available datasets from geriatrics, palliative care, and colonoscopy imaging.
For example, in the case of structured data (anxiety data) and unstructured
data (colonoscopy polyps data), the pipeline begins with file-type detection by
the Ingestion Identifier Agent, followed by the Data Anonymizer Agent ensuring
privacy compliance, where we first identify the data type and then anonymize
it. The Feature Extraction Agent identifies features using an embedding-based
approach for tabular data, extracting all column names, and a multi-stage
MedGemma-based approach for image data, which infers modality and disease name.
These features guide the Model-Data Feature Matcher Agent in selecting the
best-fit model from a curated repository. The Preprocessing Recommender Agent
and Preprocessing Implementor Agent then apply tailored preprocessing based on
data type and model requirements. Finally, the ``Model Inference Agent" runs
the selected model on the uploaded data and generates interpretable outputs
using tools like SHAP, LIME, and DETR attention maps. By automating these
high-friction stages of the ML lifecycle, the proposed framework reduces the
need for repeated expert intervention, offering a scalable, cost-efficient
pathway for operationalizing AI in clinical environments.

TL;DR: The study uses NLP and Active Learning to create a classifier for detecting vaccine safety issues from ED triage notes, improving surveillance efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited safety data from clinical trials and early vaccine implementation necessitates better post-licensure surveillance systems.

Method: Combines NLP, Active Learning, and data augmentation to develop a classifier for ED triage notes.

Result: A more accurate and efficient classifier for vaccine safety surveillance is created, reducing reliance on keyword-based methods.

Conclusion: The approach enhances timely detection of vaccine safety signals, leveraging expert ED notes and advanced ML techniques.

Abstract: The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines has showcased the global
communitys ability to combat infectious diseases. However, the need for
post-licensure surveillance systems has grown due to the limited window for
safety data collection in clinical trials and early widespread implementation.
This study aims to employ Natural Language Processing techniques and Active
Learning to rapidly develop a classifier that detects potential vaccine safety
issues from emergency department notes. ED triage notes, containing expert,
succinct vital patient information at the point of entry to health systems, can
significantly contribute to timely vaccine safety signal surveillance. While
keyword-based classification can be effective, it may yield false positives and
demand extensive keyword modifications. This is exacerbated by the infrequency
of vaccination-related ED presentations and their similarity to other reasons
for ED visits. NLP offers a more accurate and efficient alternative, albeit
requiring annotated data, which is often scarce in the medical field. Active
learning optimizes the annotation process and the quality of annotated data,
which can result in faster model implementation and improved model performance.
This work combines active learning, data augmentation, and active learning and
evaluation techniques to create a classifier that is used to enhance vaccine
safety surveillance from ED triage notes.

*Moritz Schönherr,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mean GNNs match ratio modal logic in non-uniform settings, surpassing max GNNs but lagging behind sum GNNs. In uniform settings, they align with alternation-free modal logic under certain conditions, showing lower expressivity than sum and max GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the expressive power of GNNs with mean aggregation compared to other aggregation functions (sum, max) and their relation to modal logic.

Method: Analyze GNNs with mean aggregation in non-uniform and uniform settings, comparing their expressive power to modal logic variants (ratio, alternation-free).

Result: Mean GNNs are equivalent to ratio modal logic non-uniformly, less expressive than sum GNNs uniformly under specific conditions.

Conclusion: Mean GNNs have distinct expressive power, influenced by aggregation choice and setting, with implications for model selection in graph tasks.

Abstract: We study the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) with mean as
the aggregation function. In the non-uniform setting, we show that such GNNs
have exactly the same expressive power as ratio modal logic, which has modal
operators expressing that at least a certain ratio of the successors of a
vertex satisfies a specified property. The non-uniform expressive power of mean
GNNs is thus higher than that of GNNs with max aggregation, but lower than for
sum aggregation--the latter are characterized by modal logic and graded modal
logic, respectively. In the uniform setting, we show that the expressive power
relative to MSO is exactly that of alternation-free modal logic, under the
natural assumptions that combination functions are continuous and
classification functions are thresholds. This implies that, relative to MSO and
in the uniform setting, mean GNNs are strictly less expressive than sum GNNs
and max GNNs. When any of the assumptions is dropped, the expressive power
increases.

### [103] [Decoupling Knowledge and Reasoning in LLMs: An Exploration Using Cognitive Dual-System Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18178)
*Mutian Yang,Jiandong Gao,Ji Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to decouple knowledge and reasoning in LLMs, analyzing their contributions through fast and slow thinking modes. Findings include domain-specific reasoning benefits, parameter scaling effects, and layer-specific knowledge/reasoning distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and distinguish the roles of knowledge and reasoning in LLMs for better model analysis, interpretability, and development.

Method: A cognition attribution framework decomposes LLM cognition into knowledge retrieval (Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2), using fast and slow thinking prompts to analyze contributions.

Result: (1) Reasoning is domain-specific, aiding reasoning-heavy domains. (2) Parameter scaling boosts knowledge and reasoning, with reasoning becoming more prudent. (3) Knowledge is in lower layers, reasoning in higher layers.

Conclusion: The framework offers insights into LLM behavior, scaling laws, and hierarchical knowledge editing, advancing understanding of model capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning
during inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role
in model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system
cognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the
contribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs
is decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval
(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs
are prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast
thinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different
cognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and
reasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results
reveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting
reasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and
potentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling
improves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more
pronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly
more prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily
resides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers. Our
framework not only helps understand LLMs from a "decoupling" perspective, but
also provides new insights into existing research, including scaling laws,
hierarchical knowledge editing, and limitations of small-model reasoning.

### [104] [Comparing Non-minimal Semantics for Disjunction in Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18198)
*Felicidad Aguado,Pedro Cabalar,Brais Muñiz,Gilberto Pérez,Concepción Vidal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares four non-minimal semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming, showing three coincide and are stronger than the fourth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore alternative semantics for disjunction in Answer Set Programming that do not rely on model minimality, providing a broader understanding of disjunctive reasoning.

Method: Comparison and theoretical analysis of four semantics: Justified Models, Strongly Supported Models, Forks, and Determining Inference (DI) semantics.

Result: Three semantics (Forks, Justified Models, and a relaxed DI) coincide and are stronger than Strongly Supported Models, which aligns with classical logic.

Conclusion: The study identifies a unified non-minimal semantics for disjunction, offering a superset of stable models and insights into alternative reasoning approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we compare four different semantics for disjunction in Answer
Set Programming that, unlike stable models, do not adhere to the principle of
model minimality. Two of these approaches, Cabalar and Mu\~niz' \emph{Justified
Models} and Doherty and Szalas' \emph{Strongly Supported Models}, directly
provide an alternative non-minimal semantics for disjunction. The other two,
Aguado et al's \emph{Forks} and Shen and Eiter's \emph{Determining Inference}
(DI) semantics, actually introduce a new disjunction connective, but are
compared here as if they constituted new semantics for the standard disjunction
operator. We are able to prove that three of these approaches (Forks, Justified
Models and a reasonable relaxation of the DI semantics) actually coincide,
constituting a common single approach under different definitions. Moreover,
this common semantics always provides a superset of the stable models of a
program (in fact, modulo any context) and is strictly stronger than the fourth
approach (Strongly Supported Models), that actually treats disjunctions as in
classical logic.

*Antonino Rotolo,Beatrice Ferrigno,Jose Miguel Angel Garcia Godinez,Claudio Novelli,Giovanni Sartor*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A conceptual framework for qualitative AI risk assessment under the EU AI Act, combining definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning to address legal compliance and rights protection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the complexities of AI risk assessment in legal contexts, ensuring compliance with the EU AI Act while protecting fundamental rights.

Method: Integrates definitional balancing (proportionality analysis) and defeasible reasoning to analyze AI deployment scenarios, legal violations, and rights impacts.

Result: Provides philosophical foundations for AI risk analysis, enabling operative models for high-risk and General Purpose AI systems.

Conclusion: Future work will develop formal models and algorithms to enhance practical AI risk assessment and governance.

Abstract: This chapter introduces a conceptual framework for qualitative risk
assessment of AI, particularly in the context of the EU AI Act. The framework
addresses the complexities of legal compliance and fundamental rights
protection by itegrating definitional balancing and defeasible reasoning.
Definitional balancing employs proportionality analysis to resolve conflicts
between competing rights, while defeasible reasoning accommodates the dynamic
nature of legal decision-making. Our approach stresses the need for an analysis
of AI deployment scenarios and for identifying potential legal violations and
multi-layered impacts on fundamental rights. On the basis of this analysis, we
provide philosophical foundations for a logical account of AI risk analysis. In
particular, we consider the basic building blocks for conceptually grasping the
interaction between AI deployment scenarios and fundamental rights,
incorporating in defeasible reasoning definitional balancing and arguments
about the contextual promotion or demotion of rights. This layered approach
allows for more operative models of assessment of both high-risk AI systems and
General Purpose AI (GPAI) systems, emphasizing the broader applicability of the
latter. Future work aims to develop a formal model and effective algorithms to
enhance AI risk assessment, bridging theoretical insights with practical
applications to support responsible AI governance.

*Peter Baumgartner,Lachlan McGinness*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method for automatically marking Physics exams using a combination of computer algebra, SMT solving, and term rewriting, enhanced by a Large Language Model for error correction. Evaluated on 1500+ real-world student responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the challenging task of assessing typed student answers for correctness in Physics exams, leveraging advanced computational tools.

Method: Combines a computer algebra system, SMT solver, and term rewriting system, with a Large Language Model for preprocessing student responses. Uses automated reasoning (SMT solving and tailored term rewriting) for correctness assessment.

Result: Developed a system evaluated on over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics Olympiad.

Conclusion: The method effectively automates Physics exam marking, demonstrating feasibility through real-world evaluation.

Abstract: We present our method for automatically marking Physics exams. The marking
problem consists in assessing typed student answers for correctness with
respect to a ground truth solution. This is a challenging problem that we seek
to tackle using a combination of a computer algebra system, an SMT solver and a
term rewriting system. A Large Language Model is used to interpret and remove
errors from student responses and rewrite these in a machine readable format.
Once formalized and language-aligned, the next step then consists in applying
automated reasoning techniques for assessing student solution correctness. We
consider two methods of automated theorem proving: off-the-shelf SMT solving
and term rewriting systems tailored for physics problems involving
trigonometric expressions. The development of the term rewrite system and
establishing termination and confluence properties was not trivial, and we
describe it in some detail in the paper. We evaluate our system on a rich pool
of over 1500 real-world student exam responses from the 2023 Australian Physics
Olympiad.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on factual accuracy or logic, but finance requires creative and plausible decision-making under uncertainty.

Method: ConDiFi includes 607 prompts for divergent reasoning and 990 multi-hop MCQs for convergent reasoning, tested on 14 models.

Result: GPT-4o underperforms in Novelty and Actionability, while DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ excel in actionable insights.

Conclusion: ConDiFi offers a new way to assess reasoning for safe and strategic LLM use in finance.

Abstract: Most reasoning benchmarks for LLMs emphasize factual accuracy or step-by-step
logic. In finance, however, professionals must not only converge on optimal
decisions but also generate creative, plausible futures under uncertainty. We
introduce ConDiFi, a benchmark that jointly evaluates divergent and convergent
thinking in LLMs for financial tasks.
  ConDiFi features 607 macro-financial prompts for divergent reasoning and 990
multi-hop adversarial MCQs for convergent reasoning. Using this benchmark, we
evaluated 14 leading models and uncovered striking differences. Despite high
fluency, GPT-4o underperforms on Novelty and Actionability. In contrast, models
like DeepSeek-R1 and Cohere Command R+ rank among the top for generating
actionable, insights suitable for investment decisions. ConDiFi provides a new
perspective to assess reasoning capabilities essential to safe and strategic
deployment of LLMs in finance.

### [108] [Revisiting LLM Reasoning via Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18391)
*Shiye Lei,Zhihao Cheng,Kai Jia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces IBRO, a framework grounded in the information bottleneck principle to optimize LLM reasoning, improving performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for enhancing LLM reasoning are heuristic; the paper aims to provide a principled approach.

Method: Proposes IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO) with a token-level surrogate objective and lightweight IB regularization.

Result: Empirical validation shows consistent improvements in LLM reasoning across benchmarks.

Conclusion: IBRO offers a scalable and efficient way to enhance LLM reasoning without significant computational cost.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress
in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR). By leveraging simple rule-based rewards, RL effectively
incentivizes LLMs to produce extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
trajectories, progressively guiding them toward correct answers. However,
existing approaches remain largely heuristic and intuition-driven, limiting the
development of principled methodologies. In this paper, we present a
theoretical characterization of LLM reasoning grounded in information
bottleneck (IB) principle, introducing IB-aware reasoning optimization (IBRO),
a framework that encourages reasoning trajectories to be both informative about
the final correct answer and generalizable across diverse prompts. We derive a
practical token-level surrogate objective and propose an efficient
approximation, resulting in the lightweight IB regularization method. This
technique integrates seamlessly into existing RL-based post-training frameworks
without additional computational overhead, requiring only a one-line code
modification. Empirically, we validate IB regularization across multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and RL algorithms, demonstrating consistent
improvements in LLM reasoning performance.

*Kwong Ho Li,Wathsala Karunarathne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper compares model-based (Value Iteration) and model-free (Proximal Policy Optimization) RL methods for call routing optimization, finding PPO superior in reducing client waiting and staff idle times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize call routing in call centers by minimizing client waiting time and staff idle time using RL.

Method: Two approaches: model-based (Value Iteration under known dynamics) and model-free (PPO learning from experience). Both framed as MDPs in a Skills-Based Routing framework.

Result: PPO outperforms Value Iteration and random policies, achieving the highest rewards and lowest waiting/idle times after 1,000 test episodes.

Conclusion: PPO is more effective for call routing optimization despite longer training times.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimise call routing in call centres to minimise client waiting time and staff
idle time. Two methods are compared: a model-based approach using Value
Iteration (VI) under known system dynamics, and a model-free approach using
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) that learns from experience. For the
model-based approach, a theoretical model is used, while a simulation model
combining Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with the OpenAI Gym environment is
developed for model-free learning. Both models frame the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) within a Skills-Based Routing (SBR) framework, with
Poisson client arrivals and exponentially distributed service and abandonment
times. For policy evaluation, random, VI, and PPO policies are evaluated using
the simulation model. After 1,000 test episodes, PPO consistently achives the
highest rewards, along with the lowest client waiting time and staff idle time,
despite requiring longer training time.

*Enrico Santi,Fabio Tardivo,Agostino Dovier,Andrea Formisano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm for table constraints in constraint programming by leveraging GPU acceleration to handle large-scale problems more effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard CPU-based approaches struggle with real-world problems involving hundreds or thousands of cases in table constraints, necessitating more efficient solutions.

Method: The study designs and implements a GPU-accelerated version of the CT algorithm, integrating it into an existing constraint solver.

Result: Experimental validation on significant instances demonstrates the effectiveness of GPU-accelerated CT in handling large table constraints.

Conclusion: GPU acceleration significantly improves the performance of the CT algorithm, making it viable for large-scale constraint programming problems.

Abstract: Constraint Programming developed within Logic Programming in the Eighties;
nowadays all Prolog systems encompass modules capable of handling constraint
programming on finite domains demanding their solution to a constraint solver.
This work focuses on a specific form of constraint, the so-called table
constraint, used to specify conditions on the values of variables as an
enumeration of alternative options. Since every condition on a set of finite
domain variables can be ultimately expressed as a finite set of cases, Table
can, in principle, simulate any other constraint. These characteristics make
Table one of the most studied constraints ever, leading to a series of
increasingly efficient propagation algorithms. Despite this, it is not uncommon
to encounter real-world problems with hundreds or thousands of valid cases that
are simply too many to be handled effectively with standard CPU-based
approaches. In this paper, we deal with the Compact-Table (CT) algorithm, the
state-of-the-art propagation algorithms for Table. We describe how CT can be
enhanced by exploiting the massive computational power offered by modern GPUs
to handle large Table constraints. In particular, we report on the design and
implementation of GPU-accelerated CT, on its integration into an existing
constraint solver, and on an experimental validation performed on a significant
set of instances.

*Manuel de Sousa Ribeiro,Afonso Leote,João Leite*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of training data on concept probing models in image classification, addressing a gap in current research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the interpretability of neural networks by focusing on the data used for training concept probing models, which has been overlooked.

Method: Investigates the effect of training data on probing model performance in image classification tasks.

Result: Provides insights into how training data influences probing model effectiveness and releases concept labels for two popular datasets.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of training data in concept probing and contributes labeled datasets to aid future research.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently garnered increasing interest as a way to help
interpret artificial neural networks, dealing both with their typically large
size and their subsymbolic nature, which ultimately renders them unfeasible for
direct human interpretation. Concept probing works by training additional
classifiers to map the internal representations of a model into human-defined
concepts of interest, thus allowing humans to peek inside artificial neural
networks. Research on concept probing has mainly focused on the model being
probed or the probing model itself, paying limited attention to the data
required to train such probing models. In this paper, we address this gap.
Focusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we
investigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their
performance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used
datasets.

Motivation: To develop a model that co-evolves capabilities and safety, moving beyond simple preference learning to intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection.

Method: Uses the SafeLadder framework with progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training and multi-principled verifiers. Includes inference-time interventions and deliberative search for step-level verification.

Result: Achieves a 46.54% average improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety benchmarks while maintaining general capabilities, and outperforms proprietary models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that safety and capability can co-evolve synergistically, proving the generalizability of the SafeLadder framework for robust AI.

Abstract: We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that
demonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our
proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,
safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of
multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that
simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop
intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety
`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of
$46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks
without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety
performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude
Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct
inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,
enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop
SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and
SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and
capability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of
our framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Shop-R1 is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs' reasoning for simulating human behavior in online shopping by decomposing tasks into rationale generation and action prediction with distinct rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of LLM-generated rationales in simulating human behavior, particularly in online shopping environments.

Method: Decomposes tasks into rationale generation (self-supervised) and action prediction (hierarchical reward structure). Uses internal model signals and difficulty-aware scaling.

Result: Achieves a 65% relative improvement over baseline methods.

Conclusion: Shop-R1 effectively enhances LLM reasoning for human behavior simulation in online shopping.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in
generating 'believable human-like' behavior in web environments. Prior work has
explored augmenting training data with LLM-synthesized rationales and applying
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance reasoning ability, which in turn can
improve downstream action prediction. However, the performance of such
approaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the
model used to generate the rationales. In this paper, we introduce Shop-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at enhancing the reasoning
ability of LLMs for simulation of real human behavior in online shopping
environments Specifically, Shop-R1 decomposes the human behavior simulation
task into two stages: rationale generation and action prediction, each guided
by distinct reward signals. For rationale generation, we leverage internal
model signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a
self-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward
structure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable
fine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action
types and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and
values), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a relative improvement of over 65%
compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DG-PRM introduces a dynamic and generalizable process reward model using a reward tree and Pareto dominance estimation, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks and showing strong adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs rely on heuristics and lack cross-domain generalization, while LLM-as-judge overlooks meaningful guidance. Static evaluation criteria also fail in complex process supervision.

Method: DG-PRM uses a reward tree for fine-grained, multi-dimensional criteria and dynamically selects step-wise rewards. Pareto dominance estimation identifies discriminative pairs.

Result: DG-PRM achieves high performance on benchmarks, significantly improving model performance and adapting well to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: DG-PRM offers a robust solution for process reward modeling, demonstrating superior generalizability and effectiveness in complex tasks.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) are crucial for guiding Large Language Models
(LLMs) in complex scenarios by providing dense reward signals. However,
existing PRMs primarily rely on heuristic approaches, which struggle with
cross-domain generalization. While LLM-as-judge has been proposed to provide
generalized rewards, current research has focused mainly on feedback results,
overlooking the meaningful guidance embedded within the text. Additionally,
static and coarse-grained evaluation criteria struggle to adapt to complex
process supervision. To tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic and
Generalizable Process Reward Modeling (DG-PRM), which features a reward tree to
capture and store fine-grained, multi-dimensional reward criteria. DG-PRM
dynamically selects reward signals for step-wise reward scoring. To handle
multifaceted reward signals, we pioneeringly adopt Pareto dominance estimation
to identify discriminative positive and negative pairs. Experimental results
show that DG-PRM achieves stunning performance on prevailing benchmarks,
significantly boosting model performance across tasks with dense rewards.
Further analysis reveals that DG-PRM adapts well to out-of-distribution
scenarios, demonstrating exceptional generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored challenge of cognitive biases in analytical questions posed by users without statistical backgrounds in NLIDBs.

Method: Introduces a contextual semantic mapping framework, an analytical framework based on the Hard-to-Vary principle, and an optimized LLM-powered system for high-quality prompts.

Result: 82.5% of users reported improved analysis quality; VeriMinder outperformed alternatives by at least 20% in concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy.

Conclusion: VeriMinder effectively mitigates 'wrong question' vulnerabilities in data analysis and is open-sourced for community adoption.

Abstract: Application systems using natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs)
have democratized data analysis. This positive development has also brought
forth an urgent challenge to help users who might use these systems without a
background in statistical analysis to formulate bias-free analytical questions.
Although significant research has focused on text-to-SQL generation accuracy,
addressing cognitive biases in analytical questions remains underexplored. We
present VeriMinder, https://veriminder.ai, an interactive system for detecting
and mitigating such analytical vulnerabilities. Our approach introduces three
key innovations: (1) a contextual semantic mapping framework for biases
relevant to specific analysis contexts (2) an analytical framework that
operationalizes the Hard-to-Vary principle and guides users in systematic data
analysis (3) an optimized LLM-powered system that generates high-quality,
task-specific prompts using a structured process involving multiple candidates,
critic feedback, and self-reflection.
  User testing confirms the merits of our approach. In direct user experience
evaluation, 82.5% participants reported positively impacting the quality of the
analysis. In comparative evaluation, VeriMinder scored significantly higher
than alternative approaches, at least 20% better when considered for metrics of
the analysis's concreteness, comprehensiveness, and accuracy. Our system,
implemented as a web application, is set to help users avoid "wrong question"
vulnerability during data analysis. VeriMinder code base with prompts,
https://reproducibility.link/veriminder, is available as an MIT-licensed
open-source software to facilitate further research and adoption within the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve ASA for multi-part second-language tests by eliminating transcription and per-part models, making it practical for large-scale use.

Method: Uses a single Whisper-small encoder for all spoken responses, combines information via a lightweight aggregator, and employs a data sampling strategy for training efficiency.

Result: Achieved RMSE of 0.384 (better than text-based baseline 0.44) with 168M parameters and trained on only 44.8% of speakers, showing strong data efficiency.

Conclusion: The system is efficient, scalable, and effective for ASA, with potential for large-scale Computer-Assisted Language Learning applications.

Abstract: We present an efficient end-to-end approach for holistic Automatic Speaking
Assessment (ASA) of multi-part second-language tests, developed for the 2025
Speak & Improve Challenge. Our system's main novelty is the ability to process
all four spoken responses with a single Whisper-small encoder, combine all
information via a lightweight aggregator, and predict the final score. This
architecture removes the need for transcription and per-part models, cuts
inference time, and makes ASA practical for large-scale Computer-Assisted
Language Learning systems.
  Our system achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.384, outperforming
the text-based baseline (0.44) while using at most 168M parameters (about 70%
of Whisper-small). Furthermore, we propose a data sampling strategy, allowing
the model to train on only 44.8% of the speakers in the corpus and still reach
0.383 RMSE, demonstrating improved performance on imbalanced classes and strong
data efficiency.

Method: Tested six AI detectors on DeepSeek-generated text, including adversarial attacks (paraphrasing, humanization). Used few-shot and CoT prompting for detection.

Result: QuillBot and Copyleaks performed well on original/paraphrased text, but humanization reduced accuracy. Few-shot and CoT prompting achieved high accuracy (96% AI recall, 100% human recall).

Conclusion: Adversarial attacks weaken detection, but few-shot and CoT methods are promising for identifying AI-generated text from newer LLMs like DeepSeek.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed the creation of written
materials. LLMs have led to questions about writing integrity, thereby driving
the creation of artificial intelligence (AI) detection technologies.
Adversarial attacks, such as standard and humanized paraphrasing, inhibit
detectors' ability to detect machine-generated text. Previous studies have
mainly focused on ChatGPT and other well-known LLMs and have shown varying
accuracy across detectors. However, there is a clear gap in the literature
about DeepSeek, a recently published LLM. Therefore, in this work, we
investigate whether six generally accessible AI detection tools -- AI Text
Classifier, Content Detector AI, Copyleaks, QuillBot, GPT-2, and GPTZero -- can
consistently recognize text generated by DeepSeek. The detectors were exposed
to the aforementioned adversarial attacks. We also considered DeepSeek as a
detector by performing few-shot prompting and chain-of-thought reasoning (CoT)
for classifying AI and human-written text. We collected 49 human-authored
question-answer pairs from before the LLM era and generated matching responses
using DeepSeek-v3, producing 49 AI-generated samples. Then, we applied
adversarial techniques such as paraphrasing and humanizing to add 196 more
samples. These were used to challenge detector robustness and assess accuracy
impact. While QuillBot and Copyleaks showed near-perfect performance on
original and paraphrased DeepSeek text, others -- particularly AI Text
Classifier and GPT-2 -- showed inconsistent results. The most effective attack
was humanization, reducing accuracy to 71% for Copyleaks, 58% for QuillBot, and
52% for GPTZero. Few-shot and CoT prompting showed high accuracy, with the best
five-shot result misclassifying only one of 49 samples (AI recall 96%, human
recall 100%).

*Sohaib Imran,Ihor Kendiukhov,Matthew Broerman,Aditya Thomas,Riccardo Campanella,Rob Lamb,Peter M. Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Larger language models align better with Bayes' theorem when updating beliefs, measured using a Bayesian Coherence Coefficient (BCC).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if bigger, more capable language models update beliefs more consistently with Bayes' theorem when given evidence.

Method: Formulated BCC metric, created a dataset, and tested multiple pre-trained models across five families, comparing parameters, training data, and benchmark scores.

Result: Larger, more capable models showed more coherent credence updates with Bayes' theorem.

Conclusion: Findings impact understanding and governance of LLMs, suggesting improved Bayesian coherence with scale.

Abstract: Do larger and more capable language models learn to update their "beliefs"
about propositions more consistently with Bayes' theorem when presented with
evidence in-context? To test this, we formulate a Bayesian Coherence
Coefficient (BCC) metric and generate a dataset with which to measure the BCC.
We measure BCC for multiple pre-trained-only language models across five model
families, comparing against the number of model parameters, the amount of
training data, and model scores on common benchmarks. Our results provide
evidence for our hypothesis that larger and more capable pre-trained language
models assign credences that are more coherent with Bayes' theorem. These
results have important implications for our understanding and governance of
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance language model performance with minimal architectural changes by refining training strategies, focusing on reasoning, coding, and speed.

Method: Enhanced pre-training (10T tokens), SFT, DPO, continual pretraining with domain-specific data, and RL for specialized tasks.

Result: TeleChat2.5 and T1 (115B parameters) show significant improvements in reasoning and task performance, surpassing models like GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The TeleChat series offers state-of-the-art models for diverse applications, publicly released to support developers and researchers.

Abstract: We introduce the latest series of TeleChat models: \textbf{TeleChat2},

their predecessor, TeleChat. Despite minimal changes to the model architecture,
the new series achieves substantial performance gains through enhanced training
strategies in both pre-training and post-training stages. The series begins

combined with reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in code
generation and mathematical reasoning tasks. The \textbf{T1} variant is
designed for complex reasoning, supporting long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning and demonstrating substantial improvements in mathematics and coding.
In contrast, \textbf{TeleChat2.5} prioritizes speed, delivering rapid
inference. Both flagship models of \textbf{T1} and \textbf{TeleChat2.5} are
dense Transformer-based architectures with 115B parameters, showcasing
significant advancements in reasoning and general task performance compared to
the original TeleChat. Notably, \textbf{T1-115B} outperform proprietary models
such as OpenAI's o1-mini and GPT-4o. We publicly release \textbf{TeleChat2},

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NeuralDB, a non-linear gated retrieval framework, efficiently edits large language models (LLMs) without compromising general abilities, scaling to 100,000 facts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current linear Locate-and-Edit (L&E) methods risk degrading LLM performance and forgetting edited facts when scaled.

Method: Model linear L&E as a Key-Value (KV) database; propose NeuralDB with a non-linear gated retrieval module for selective fact editing.

Result: NeuralDB outperforms in editing efficacy, generalization, and preserves performance across six tasks, scaling to 100,000 facts.

Conclusion: NeuralDB offers a scalable, effective solution for editing LLMs while maintaining their general capabilities.

Abstract: Efficiently editing knowledge stored in large language models (LLMs) enables
model updates without large-scale training. One possible solution is
Locate-and-Edit (L\&E), allowing simultaneous modifications of a massive number
of facts. However, such editing may compromise the general abilities of LLMs
and even result in forgetting edited facts when scaling up to thousands of
edits. In this paper, we model existing linear L\&E methods as querying a
Key-Value (KV) database. From this perspective, we then propose NeuralDB, an
editing framework that explicitly represents the edited facts as a neural KV
database equipped with a non-linear gated retrieval module, % In particular,
our gated module only operates when inference involves the edited facts,
effectively preserving the general abilities of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments
involving the editing of 10,000 facts were conducted on the ZsRE and
CounterFacts datasets, using GPT2-XL, GPT-J (6B) and Llama-3 (8B). The results
demonstrate that NeuralDB not only excels in editing efficacy, generalization,
specificity, fluency, and consistency, but also preserves overall performance
across six representative text understanding and generation tasks. Further
experiments indicate that NeuralDB maintains its effectiveness even when scaled
to 100,000 facts (\textbf{50x} more than in prior work).

### [122] [GrAInS: Gradient-based Attribution for Inference-Time Steering of LLMs and VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18043)
*Duy Nguyen,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrAInS introduces a gradient-based, token-level steering method for LLMs and VLMs, outperforming fine-tuning and baselines by leveraging contrastive attribution and preserving model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inference-time steering methods use fixed vectors, ignore token-level causality, and underutilize gradients, especially in multimodal contexts.

Method: GrAInS uses Integrated Gradients for token attribution, constructs directional steering vectors, and adjusts activations during inference.

Result: GrAInS improves accuracy (13.22% on TruthfulQA), reduces hallucinations (0.624 to 0.514 on MMHal-Bench), and boosts alignment (8.11% on SPA-VL).

Conclusion: GrAInS offers fine-grained, interpretable control without retraining, enhancing model behavior while maintaining fluency and general capabilities.

Abstract: Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by
modifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.
However, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,
overlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage
informative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal
settings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these
limitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that
operates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS
uses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to
identify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively
attributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred
outputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors
that capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During
inference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by
token-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve
representational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular
control over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.
Empirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing
steering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using
Llama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514
with LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all
while preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.

*Hoyeon Lee,Sejung Son,Ye-Eun Kang,Jong-Hwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic phrase break annotations, reducing reliance on manual annotations and addressing challenges in speech-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for phrase break prediction depend on costly human annotations and face variability in speech data. LLMs offer a potential solution by generating synthetic data.

Method: The study leverages LLMs to create synthetic phrase break annotations, comparing them with traditional annotations and evaluating effectiveness across multiple languages.

Result: LLM-based synthetic data generation effectively reduces data challenges in phrase break prediction.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as a viable solution for addressing data challenges in the speech domain.

Abstract: Current approaches to phrase break prediction address crucial prosodic
aspects of text-to-speech systems but heavily rely on vast human annotations
from audio or text, incurring significant manual effort and cost. Inherent
variability in the speech domain, driven by phonetic factors, further
complicates acquiring consistent, high-quality data. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) have shown success in addressing data challenges in NLP by
generating tailored synthetic data while reducing manual annotation needs.
Motivated by this, we explore leveraging LLM to generate synthetic phrase break
annotations, addressing the challenges of both manual annotation and
speech-related tasks by comparing with traditional annotations and assessing
effectiveness across multiple languages. Our findings suggest that LLM-based
synthetic data generation effectively mitigates data challenges in phrase break
prediction and highlights the potential of LLMs as a viable solution for the
speech domain.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates diversity and privacy risks in synthetic data from LLMs, proposing metrics and a prompt-based method to improve diversity while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored diversity and privacy risks in synthetic data generated by LLMs, which is increasingly used in data-driven applications.

Method: Proposes metrics to assess diversity (linguistic expression, sentiment, user perspective) and privacy (re-identification risk, stylistic outliers) of synthetic data, and introduces a prompt-based approach to enhance diversity and privacy.

Result: Experiments show LLMs have limitations in generating diverse and privacy-preserving synthetic data. The prompt-based method improves diversity while maintaining privacy.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' shortcomings in synthetic data generation and offers a practical solution to enhance diversity and privacy.

Abstract: The increasing use of synthetic data generated by Large Language Models
(LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges in data-driven applications.
While synthetic data provides a cost-effective, scalable alternative to
real-world data to facilitate model training, its diversity and privacy risks
remain underexplored. Focusing on text-based synthetic data, we propose a
comprehensive set of metrics to quantitatively assess the diversity (i.e.,
linguistic expression, sentiment, and user perspective), and privacy (i.e.,
re-identification risk and stylistic outliers) of synthetic datasets generated
by several state-of-the-art LLMs. Experiment results reveal significant
limitations in LLMs' capabilities in generating diverse and privacy-preserving
synthetic data. Guided by the evaluation results, a prompt-based approach is
proposed to enhance the diversity of synthetic reviews while preserving
reviewer privacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TELEVAL is a dynamic benchmark for evaluating spoken language models (SLMs) in realistic Chinese conversational settings, focusing on implicit cues and user-centered metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for SLMs often misalign with real-world conversational interactions, prompting the need for a more user-centered evaluation framework.

Method: TELEVAL evaluates SLMs across three dimensions (Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and Implicit Semantics, System Abilities) using dialogue formats and separate text/audio output assessments.

Result: Experiments show current SLMs still struggle with natural conversational tasks, highlighting room for improvement.

Conclusion: TELEVAL aims to improve SLM development by aligning evaluation with real-world user experiences and focusing on implicit conversational cues.

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, along
with the development of numerous benchmarks for evaluating their performance.
However, most existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating whether SLMs
can perform complex tasks comparable to those tackled by large language models
(LLMs), often failing to align with how users naturally interact in real-world
conversational scenarios. In this paper, we propose TELEVAL, a dynamic
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate SLMs' effectiveness as
conversational agents in realistic Chinese interactive settings. TELEVAL
defines three evaluation dimensions: Explicit Semantics, Paralinguistic and
Implicit Semantics, and System Abilities. It adopts a dialogue format
consistent with real-world usage and evaluates text and audio outputs
separately. TELEVAL particularly focuses on the model's ability to extract
implicit cues from user speech and respond appropriately without additional
instructions. Our experiments demonstrate that despite recent progress,
existing SLMs still have considerable room for improvement in natural
conversational tasks. We hope that TELEVAL can serve as a user-centered
evaluation framework that directly reflects the user experience and contributes
to the development of more capable dialogue-oriented SLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational bottleneck of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to their scale and memory demands.

Method: Introduces a hybrid PEFT strategy integrating BOFT's stability and LoRA-GA's convergence, with adaptive per-layer updates. Also adapts uRNN principles for transformers.

Result: Outperforms baselines on benchmarks (GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench, HumanEval), reducing training time by 2.1x and memory by 50%.

Conclusion: The hybrid PEFT method is a scalable solution for fine-tuning LLMs under resource constraints.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains a computational bottleneck
due to their scale and memory demands. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, including
LoRA, BOFT, LoRA-GA, and uRNN, and introduces a novel hybrid strategy that
dynamically integrates BOFT's orthogonal stability with LoRA-GA's
gradient-aligned rapid convergence. By computing per-layer adaptive updates
guided by gradient norms, the hybrid method achieves superior convergence
efficiency and generalization across diverse tasks. We also explore, for the
first time, the adaptation of unitary RNN (uRNN) principles to
transformer-based LLMs, enhancing gradient stability through structured unitary
constraints. Empirical evaluations on four benchmarks -- GLUE, GSM8K, MT-Bench,
and HumanEval -- using models ranging from 7B to 405B parameters demonstrate
that our hybrid method consistently outperforms individual PEFT baselines,
approaching full fine-tuning accuracy while reducing resource consumption by up
to 2.1 times in training time and 50 percent in memory usage. These findings
establish the hybrid approach as a practical and scalable fine-tuning solution
for real-world deployment of LLMs under resource constraints.

TL;DR: The paper introduces updated 2024 English GloVe models, addressing gaps in documentation and incorporating contemporary language trends, showing improved performance on modern tasks like NER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To update the 2014 GloVe models due to evolving language and lack of documentation, ensuring relevance and clarity for current usage.

Method: Trained two sets of word embeddings using Wikipedia, Gigaword, and Dolma, evaluated via vocabulary comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks.

Result: The 2024 models include new culturally relevant words, perform similarly on structural tasks, and improve on temporally dependent NER datasets.

Conclusion: The updated GloVe models are better documented, linguistically current, and perform well on modern NLP tasks.

Abstract: This report documents, describes, and evaluates new 2024 English GloVe
(Global Vectors for Word Representation) models. While the original GloVe
models built in 2014 have been widely used and found useful, languages and the
world continue to evolve and we thought that current usage could benefit from
updated models. Moreover, the 2014 models were not carefully documented as to
the exact data versions and preprocessing that were used, and we rectify this
by documenting these new models. We trained two sets of word embeddings using
Wikipedia, Gigaword, and a subset of Dolma. Evaluation through vocabulary
comparison, direct testing, and NER tasks shows that the 2024 vectors
incorporate new culturally and linguistically relevant words, perform
comparably on structural tasks like analogy and similarity, and demonstrate
improved performance on recent, temporally dependent NER datasets such as
non-Western newswire data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOAT-SLM is a spoken language model that incorporates paralinguistic and speaker characteristics, improving natural spoken interactions beyond text semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLMs overlook paralinguistic cues (e.g., emotion, dialect). GOAT-SLM aims to address this gap for more natural interactions.

Method: Uses a dual-modality head architecture and modular staged training to align linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristics.

Result: Outperforms existing models in emotion, dialect, and age-sensitive tasks on TELEVAL benchmark.

Conclusion: GOAT-SLM advances socially aware spoken language systems by modeling beyond linguistic content.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end spoken language models (SLMs) have
significantly improved the ability of AI systems to engage in natural spoken
interactions. However, most existing models treat speech merely as a vehicle
for linguistic content, often overlooking the rich paralinguistic and speaker
characteristic cues embedded in human speech, such as dialect, age, emotion,
and non-speech vocalizations. In this work, we introduce GOAT-SLM, a novel
spoken language model with paralinguistic and speaker characteristic awareness,
designed to extend spoken language modeling beyond text semantics. GOAT-SLM
adopts a dual-modality head architecture that decouples linguistic modeling
from acoustic realization, enabling robust language understanding while
supporting expressive and adaptive speech generation. To enhance model
efficiency and versatility, we propose a modular, staged training strategy that
progressively aligns linguistic, paralinguistic, and speaker characteristic
information using large-scale speech-text corpora. Experimental results on
TELEVAL, a multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark, demonstrate that GOAT-SLM
achieves well-balanced performance across both semantic and non-semantic tasks,
and outperforms existing open-source models in handling emotion, dialectal
variation, and age-sensitive interactions. This work highlights the importance
of modeling beyond linguistic content and advances the development of more
natural, adaptive, and socially aware spoken language systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to perform visual operations via code in multi-modal mathematical reasoning, highlighting gaps in current evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of MLLMs focus on text-only reasoning, neglecting their ability to perform accurate visual operations via code, which is crucial for multi-modal mathematical reasoning.

Method: The study introduces a framework with two evaluation aspects: Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) for creating visualizations and Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) for fine-grained operations (Deletion, Modification, Annotation). A dataset of five mathematical figure types is used to test nine mainstream MLLMs.

Result: Results show that current MLLMs significantly underperform humans in fine-grained visual operations.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for improved MLLM capabilities in visual operations via code for multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled
step-by-step multi-modal mathematical reasoning by performing visual operations
based on the textual instructions. A promising approach uses code as an
intermediate representation to precisely express and manipulate the images in
the reasoning steps. However, existing evaluations focus mainly on text-only
reasoning outputs, leaving the MLLM's ability to perform accurate visual
operations via code largely unexplored. This work takes a first step toward
addressing that gap by evaluating MLLM's code-based capabilities in multi-modal
mathematical reasoning.Specifically, our framework focuses on two key
evaluation aspects: (1) Multi-modal Code Generation (MCG) evaluates the model's
ability to accurately understand and construct visualizations from scratch. (2)
Multi-modal Code Editing (MCE) assesses the model's capacity for fine-grained
operations, which include three types: Deletion, Modification and Annotation.
To evaluate the above tasks, we incorporate a dataset that covers the five most
popular types of mathematical figures, including geometric diagrams, function
plots, and three types of statistical charts, to provide a comprehensive and
effective measurement of existing MLLMs. Our experimental evaluation involves
nine mainstream MLLMs, and the results reveal that existing models still lag
significantly behind human performance in performing fine-grained visual
operations.

*Gonzalo Cardenal Antolin,Jacques Fellay,Bashkim Jaha,Roger Kouyos,Niko Beerenwinkel,Diane Duroux*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study evaluates LLMs in HIV management, introducing HIVMedQA as a benchmark. Gemini 2.5 Pro performed best, but proprietary models and complexity challenges highlight the need for targeted development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show promise in clinical decision-making, but their application in HIV care is underexplored, with concerns about accuracy, harm, and clinician acceptance.

Method: Developed HIVMedQA benchmark, evaluated 10 LLMs (7 general, 3 specialized) using prompt engineering. Assessed performance via lexical similarity and LLM-as-a-judge, focusing on comprehension, reasoning, accuracy, and bias.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro outperformed others, but proprietary models dominated. Performance dropped with complexity, and fine-tuning didn't guarantee superiority. Reasoning and comprehension were harder than factual recall.

Conclusion: Targeted development and evaluation are needed for safe, effective LLM integration in HIV clinical care, addressing biases and performance gaps.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as valuable tools to support
clinicians in routine decision-making. HIV management is a compelling use case
due to its complexity, including diverse treatment options, comorbidities, and
adherence challenges. However, integrating LLMs into clinical practice raises
concerns about accuracy, potential harm, and clinician acceptance. Despite
their promise, AI applications in HIV care remain underexplored, and LLM
benchmarking studies are scarce. This study evaluates the current capabilities
of LLMs in HIV management, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We
introduce HIVMedQA, a benchmark designed to assess open-ended medical question
answering in HIV care. The dataset consists of curated, clinically relevant
questions developed with input from an infectious disease physician. We
evaluated seven general-purpose and three medically specialized LLMs, applying
prompt engineering to enhance performance. Our evaluation framework
incorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended
to better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key
dimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,
potential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro
consistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of
the top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question
complexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform
general-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of
performance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual
recall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.
These findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to
ensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.

Motivation: To investigate and address the issue of 'sticky tokens' in Transformer-based models, which degrade embedding reliability and downstream performance.

Method: Introduces Sticky Token Detector (STD), a method for detecting sticky tokens through sentence and token filtering, applied to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families.

Result: Identified 868 sticky tokens, often from special/unused vocabulary or fragmented subwords. These tokens cause up to 50% performance drops in tasks like clustering and retrieval.

Conclusion: The findings emphasize the need for improved tokenization strategies and model design to mitigate sticky token effects in future applications.

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP
tasks, surprising 'sticky tokens' can undermine the reliability of embeddings.
These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity
toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding
distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we
systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and
introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based
on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model
families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that
these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary,
as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their
presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We
further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and
retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through
attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately
dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about
tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization
strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future
text embedding applications.

*Wonjun Jeong,Dongseok Kim,Taegkeun Whangbo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCOPE is a framework to mitigate selection bias in LLM evaluations by redistributing answer slots and blocking superficial cues, improving fairness and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exploit biases in multiple-choice tasks, inflating scores without genuine understanding. SCOPE aims to measure and mitigate such biases.

Method: SCOPE uses a null prompt to estimate position-bias distributions, redistributes answer slots inversely, and prevents semantically similar distractors from being adjacent.

Result: SCOPE outperforms existing debiasing methods, showing stable improvements and clearer confidence distributions.

Conclusion: SCOPE enhances the fairness and reliability of LLM evaluations, setting a new standard.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve inflated scores on multiple-choice
tasks by exploiting inherent biases in option positions or labels, rather than
demonstrating genuine understanding. This study introduces SCOPE, an evaluation
framework designed to measure and mitigate such selection bias in a
dataset-independent manner. By repeatedly invoking a null prompt that lacks
semantic content, SCOPE estimates each model's unique position-bias
distribution. It then redistributes the answer slot according to the
inverse-bias distribution, thereby equalizing the lucky-rate, the probability
of selecting the correct answer by chance. Furthermore, it prevents
semantically similar distractors from being placed adjacent to the answer,
thereby blocking near-miss guesses based on superficial proximity cues. Across
multiple benchmark experiments, SCOPE consistently outperformed existing
debiasing methods in terms of stable performance improvements and showed
clearer confidence distributions over correct options. This framework thus
offers a new standard for enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLM
evaluations.

*Aline Belloni,Patrick Prieur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) with existing ISO9001-aligned business processes, using the SECI model and PDCA cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Organizations struggle to align ISO30401's knowledge management requirements with their existing operational processes, necessitating a clear integration framework.

Method: The study leverages process modeling principles from ISO9001 and applies the SECI model through PDCA cycles to implement KMS.

Result: The approach demonstrates how KMS can seamlessly integrate with other processes in an Integrated Management System.

Conclusion: Effective integration of KMS with operational processes is achievable using the SECI model and PDCA cycles, enhancing organizational knowledge management.

Abstract: Business process modeling is used by most organizations as an essential
framework for ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the work and workflow
performed by its employees and for ensuring the alignment of such work with its
strategic goals. For organizations that are compliant or near-compliant with
ISO 9001, this approach involves the detailed mapping of processes,
sub-processes, activities, and tasks. ISO30401 is a Management System Standard,
introduced in 2018, establishing universal requirements for the set up of a
Knowledge Management System in an organization. As ``ISO30401 implementers'' we
regularly face the challenge of explaining our clients how the knowledge
development, transformation and conveyances activities depicted in ISO30401 do
integrate with existing operational processes. This article recaps process
modelling principles in the context of ISO9001 and explores, based on our
experience, how an ISO30401-compliant Knowledge Management System (KMS)
entwines with all other processes of an Integrated Management System and in
particular how it can be implemented by deploying the mechanisms of the SECI
model through the steps of PDCA cycles.

*San Kim,Jonghwi Kim,Yejin Jeon,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTP detects poisoned documents in RAG systems by masking high-impact tokens and checking their probabilities via MLM, achieving over 90% filtering accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems are vulnerable to poisoned documents, which can mislead LLMs. A defense method is needed to ensure secure and accurate responses.

Method: GMTP identifies malicious tokens using gradients of the retriever's similarity function, masks them, and checks probabilities via MLM to filter out poisoned content.

Result: GMTP filters over 90% of poisoned documents while retaining relevant ones, maintaining robust performance across datasets.

Conclusion: GMTP effectively secures RAG systems against adversarial attacks by detecting and filtering poisoned documents with high precision.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by
providing external knowledge for accurate and up-to-date responses. However,
this reliance on external sources exposes a security risk, attackers can inject
poisoned documents into the knowledge base to steer the generation process
toward harmful or misleading outputs. In this paper, we propose Gradient-based
Masked Token Probability (GMTP), a novel defense method to detect and filter
out adversarially crafted documents. Specifically, GMTP identifies high-impact
tokens by examining gradients of the retriever's similarity function. These key
tokens are then masked, and their probabilities are checked via a Masked
Language Model (MLM). Since injected tokens typically exhibit markedly low
masked-token probabilities, this enables GMTP to easily detect malicious
documents and achieve high-precision filtering. Experiments demonstrate that
GMTP is able to eliminate over 90% of poisoned content while retaining relevant
documents, thus maintaining robust retrieval and generation performance across
diverse datasets and adversarial settings.

*Kyubeen Han,Junseo Jang,Hongjin Kim,Geunyeong Jeong,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning improves LLMs' ability to follow instructions but increases susceptibility to misinformation, shifting reliance from the assistant to the user role.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how instruction-tuning affects LLMs' vulnerability to misinformation, given its potential to enhance usability but also risks like unfiltered acceptance of false information.

Method: Analyzed the impact of instruction-tuning on LLMs' acceptance of misinformation, comparing base and instruction-tuned models, and exploring factors like prompt structure and warnings.

Result: Instruction-tuned LLMs are more likely to accept misinformation from users, showing increased reliance on user input compared to base models.

Conclusion: Systematic approaches are needed to mitigate instruction-tuning's unintended consequences and improve LLM reliability in real-world applications.

Abstract: Instruction-tuning enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
follow user instructions more accurately, improving usability while reducing
harmful outputs. However, this process may increase the model's dependence on
user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation
and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that
LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric
knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of
instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact
of instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis
reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept
misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models
shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,
shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,
we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such
as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the
presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for
systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning
and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications.

### [137] [Prune&Comp: Free Lunch for Layer-Pruned LLMs via Iterative Pruning with Magnitude Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18212)
*Xinrui Chen,Hongxing Zhang,Fanyi Zeng,Yongxian Wei,Yizhi Wang,Xitong Ling,Guanghao Li,Chun Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prune&Comp is a training-free layer pruning method for LLMs that compensates for performance degradation by rescaling weights offline, improving existing pruning metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer pruning in LLMs causes performance degradation due to hidden state magnitude gaps, which Prune&Comp aims to mitigate.

Method: Estimates magnitude gaps from layer removal and compensates by rescaling remaining weights offline, with no runtime overhead.

Result: Prune&Comp halves perplexity and retains 93.19% QA performance when pruning 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B, outperforming baselines by 4.01%.

Conclusion: Prune&Comp effectively enhances layer pruning by addressing magnitude gaps, offering a plug-and-play solution for LLM compression.

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a promising technique for compressing large
language models (LLMs) while achieving acceleration proportional to the pruning
ratio. In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant
magnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance
degradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel
plug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to
mitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate
the magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by
rescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.
We further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative
pruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,
Prune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,
when 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence
metric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\% of the
original model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by
4.01%.

*Suhang Wu,Jialong Tang,Chengyi Yang,Pei Zhang,Baosong Yang,Junhui Li,Junfeng Yao,Min Zhang,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Locate-and-Focus method improves terminology translation in speech by minimizing noise and leveraging multimodal knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate terminology translation in speech is challenging due to noise and underutilized translation knowledge.

Method: Proposes a Locate-and-Focus method to identify terminology clips and integrate multimodal knowledge for better translation.

Result: Enhances terminology translation success while maintaining general translation performance across datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses terminology translation challenges in speech by focusing on relevant knowledge.

Abstract: Direct speech translation (ST) has garnered increasing attention nowadays,
yet the accurate translation of terminology within utterances remains a great
challenge. In this regard, current studies mainly concentrate on leveraging
various translation knowledge into ST models. However, these methods often
struggle with interference from irrelevant noise and can not fully utilize the
translation knowledge. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation. It first effectively
locates the speech clips containing terminologies within the utterance to
construct translation knowledge, minimizing irrelevant information for the ST
model. Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance
and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to
better focus on translation knowledge during translation. Experimental results
across various datasets demonstrate that our method effectively locates
terminologies within utterances and enhances the success rate of terminology
translation, while maintaining robust general translation performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares six OCR engines for Low-Resourced Languages (LRLs) Sinhala and Tamil, finding Surya best for Sinhala and Document AI for Tamil, and introduces a synthetic Tamil dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCR for Latin scripts is well-researched, but LRLs with unique scripts remain challenging. This study evaluates OCR engines for Sinhala and Tamil to address this gap.

Method: Comparative analysis of six OCR engines (commercial and open-source) using five measurement techniques for accuracy at character and word levels.

Result: Surya performed best for Sinhala (WER 2.61%), while Document AI excelled for Tamil (CER 0.78%).

Conclusion: The study highlights the effectiveness of specific OCR engines for LRLs and introduces a synthetic Tamil dataset for future benchmarking.

Abstract: Solving the problem of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on printed text
for Latin and its derivative scripts can now be considered settled due to the
volumes of research done on English and other High-Resourced Languages (HRL).
However, for Low-Resourced Languages (LRL) that use unique scripts, it remains
an open problem. This study presents a comparative analysis of the zero-shot
performance of six distinct OCR engines on two LRLs: Sinhala and Tamil. The
selected engines include both commercial and open-source systems, aiming to
evaluate the strengths of each category. The Cloud Vision API, Surya, Document
AI, and Tesseract were evaluated for both Sinhala and Tamil, while Subasa OCR
and EasyOCR were examined for only one language due to their limitations. The
performance of these systems was rigorously analysed using five measurement
techniques to assess accuracy at both the character and word levels. According
to the findings, Surya delivered the best performance for Sinhala across all
metrics, with a WER of 2.61%. Conversely, Document AI excelled across all
metrics for Tamil, highlighted by a very low CER of 0.78%. In addition to the
above analysis, we also introduce a novel synthetic Tamil OCR benchmarking
dataset.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StyleAdaptedLM uses LoRA to adapt LLMs to specific styles without paired data, preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise communication requires LLMs to adopt brand or authorial tones, but this is hard without instruction-response data.

Method: Train LoRA adapters on stylistic corpora, then merge with an instruction-following model.

Result: Improved stylistic consistency and instruction adherence, validated by human evaluations.

Conclusion: StyleAdaptedLM efficiently enables stylistic personalization in LLMs.

Abstract: Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or
authorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to
achieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without
compromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework
that efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models
using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base
model with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate
instruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization
without paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across
multiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while
preserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming
brand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for
stylistic personalization in LLMs.

*Biao Yi,Zekun Fei,Jianing Geng,Tong Li,Lihai Nie,Zheli Liu,Yiming Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'overthinking backdoors' as a novel attack on large reasoning models (LRMs), enabling precise control over reasoning verbosity via a tunable trigger and data poisoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore a new attack vector against LRMs that manipulates reasoning verbosity without compromising output correctness.

Method: A tunable backdoor attack using data poisoning, where triggers (repetitions) control the intensity of verbose chain-of-thought responses generated by a teacher LLM.

Result: The attack reliably increases reasoning length without affecting answer correctness, demonstrated empirically on various LRMs.

Conclusion: The study highlights a stealthy resource-consumption attack vector, with implications for LRM security.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, representing a specialized class of large language
models (LLMs) designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks. The defining
characteristic of LRMs lies in their extensive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector
against LRMs, which we term "overthinking backdoors". We advance this concept
by proposing a novel tunable backdoor, which moves beyond simple on/off attacks
to one where an attacker can precisely control the extent of the model's
reasoning verbosity. Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning
methodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals
the desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response. These
responses are programmatically generated by instructing a teacher LLM to inject
a controlled number of redundant refinement steps into a correct reasoning
process. The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and
establishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive
empirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably
trigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning
process, without degrading the final answer's correctness. Our source code is

*Ieva Raminta Staliūnaitė,Julius Cheng,Andreas Vlachos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines gender bias in machine translation, focusing on how models handle ambiguous gender cases and the need for uncertainty in such scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biased behavior in MT models when translating gender-ambiguous lexemes, ensuring models maintain uncertainty when context is unclear.

Method: Uses semantic uncertainty metrics to evaluate models' performance on unambiguous and ambiguous gender cases, and assesses debiasing effects.

Result: Models with high accuracy on unambiguous cases often fail to show expected uncertainty in ambiguous ones; debiasing impacts ambiguous and unambiguous cases differently.

Conclusion: MT models should balance accuracy and uncertainty in gender translation, with debiasing strategies tailored to address both unambiguous and ambiguous cases.

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), when the source sentence includes a lexeme whose
gender is not overtly marked, but whose target-language equivalent requires
gender specification, the model must infer the appropriate gender from the
context and/or external knowledge. Studies have shown that MT models exhibit
biased behaviour, relying on stereotypes even when they clash with contextual
information. We posit that apart from confidently translating using the correct
gender when it is evident from the input, models should also maintain
uncertainty about the gender when it is ambiguous. Using recently proposed
metrics of semantic uncertainty, we find that models with high translation and
gender accuracy on unambiguous instances do not necessarily exhibit the
expected level of uncertainty in ambiguous ones. Similarly, debiasing has
independent effects on ambiguous and unambiguous translation instances.

*Yifu Chen,Bingchen Huang,Zhiling Wang,Yuanchao Du,Junfeng Luo,Lei Shen,Zhineng chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TDR is a novel framework for in-context learning (ICL) that improves example retrieval by decoupling task-specific examples and modeling LLM feedback, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL methods struggle with distinguishing cross-task data distributions and fine-grained feedback from LLMs, limiting example retrieval quality.

Method: TDR decouples ICL examples by task and models LLM feedback to supervise retrieval training, enhancing example quality.

Result: Experiments on 30 NLP tasks show TDR consistently improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: TDR is a plug-and-play solution that enhances ICL example retrieval and can be integrated with various LLMs.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has become a classic approach for enabling LLMs to
handle various tasks based on a few input-output examples. The effectiveness of
ICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which
focused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive
performances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality
examples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)
Difficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and
feedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR
decouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval
module to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task
dataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise
and guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve
high-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP
tasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across
all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Meanwhile, our approach
is a plug-and-play method, which can be easily combined with various LLMs to
improve example retrieval abilities for ICL. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of propaganda detection on social media due to task complexity and limited labeled data.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical taxonomy, conducts human annotation, implements LLM-assisted pre-annotation, and fine-tunes smaller models on LLM-generated data.

Result: Significant improvements in annotation agreement and time-efficiency, with smaller models trained on high-quality LLM data.

Conclusion: The framework advances scalable and robust propaganda detection, aligning with SDG 16 for transparent media ecosystems.

Abstract: Propaganda detection on social media remains challenging due to task
complexity and limited high-quality labeled data. This paper introduces a novel
framework that combines human expertise with Large Language Model (LLM)
assistance to improve both annotation consistency and scalability. We propose a
hierarchical taxonomy that organizes 14 fine-grained propaganda techniques into
three broader categories, conduct a human annotation study on the HQP dataset
that reveals low inter-annotator agreement for fine-grained labels, and
implement an LLM-assisted pre-annotation pipeline that extracts propagandistic
spans, generates concise explanations, and assigns local labels as well as a
global label. A secondary human verification study shows significant
improvements in both agreement and time-efficiency. Building on this, we
fine-tune smaller language models (SLMs) to perform structured annotation.
Instead of fine-tuning on human annotations, we train on high-quality
LLM-generated data, allowing a large model to produce these annotations and a
smaller model to learn to generate them via knowledge distillation. Our work
contributes towards the development of scalable and robust propaganda detection
systems, supporting the idea of transparent and accountable media ecosystems in
line with SDG 16. The code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR is an interactive, open-source tool for detailed error analysis of LLMs, providing textual feedback, system-level error issues, and an interactive dashboard for comprehensive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations lack actionable insights, offering only single scores or rankings without explaining why a model performs as it does.

Method: CLEAR generates per-instance feedback, identifies system-level error issues, quantifies their prevalence, and offers an interactive dashboard for analysis.

Result: The tool is demonstrated on RAG and Math benchmarks, proving its utility in detailed error analysis.

Conclusion: CLEAR bridges the gap in LLM evaluation by providing actionable insights into model performance.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly relies on other
LLMs acting as judges. However, current evaluation paradigms typically yield a
single score or ranking, answering which model is better but not why. While
essential for benchmarking, these top-level scores obscure the specific,
actionable reasons behind a model's performance. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CLEAR, an interactive, open-source package for LLM-based error
analysis. CLEAR first generates per-instance textual feedback, then it creates
a set of system-level error issues, and quantifies the prevalence of each
identified issue. Our package also provides users with an interactive dashboard
that allows for a comprehensive error analysis through aggregate
visualizations, applies interactive filters to isolate specific issues or score
ranges, and drills down to the individual instances that exemplify a particular
behavioral pattern. We demonstrate CLEAR analysis for RAG and Math benchmarks,
and showcase its utility through a user case study.

TL;DR: The study examines cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's tabular data, proposing a method to analyze and categorize them, with implications for AI reliability and multilingual knowledge systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's independent updates across languages cause factual inconsistencies, affecting its neutrality and AI systems relying on it.

Method: Developed a methodology to collect, align, and analyze multilingual Wikipedia tables, using quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Result: Identified categories of inconsistency and assessed multilingual alignment in a sample dataset.

Conclusion: Findings impact factual verification, multilingual knowledge interaction, and AI system design using Wikipedia.

Abstract: Wikipedia serves as a globally accessible knowledge source with content in
over 300 languages. Despite covering the same topics, the different versions of
Wikipedia are written and updated independently. This leads to factual
inconsistencies that can impact the neutrality and reliability of the
encyclopedia and AI systems, which often rely on Wikipedia as a main training
source. This study investigates cross-lingual inconsistencies in Wikipedia's
structured content, with a focus on tabular data. We developed a methodology to
collect, align, and analyze tables from Wikipedia multilingual articles,
defining categories of inconsistency. We apply various quantitative and
qualitative metrics to assess multilingual alignment using a sample dataset.
These insights have implications for factual verification, multilingual
knowledge interaction, and design for reliable AI systems leveraging Wikipedia
content.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinDPO introduces a finance-specific LLM framework using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for sentiment analysis, outperforming SFT models by 11% and enabling practical portfolio integration with strong returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing impact of online financial opinions on markets necessitates better sentiment analysis tools, as SFT LLMs often fail to generalize in finance.

Method: FinDPO uses DPO for post-training human preference alignment and introduces a 'logit-to-score' conversion for continuous sentiment scoring.

Result: FinDPO achieves 11% better performance than SFT models and shows 67% annual returns with a Sharpe ratio of 2.0 under realistic costs.

Conclusion: FinDPO is a groundbreaking framework for financial sentiment analysis, combining superior performance with practical trading applicability.

Abstract: Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic

### [148] [AraTable: Benchmarking LLMs' Reasoning and Understanding of Arabic Tabular Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18442)
*Rana Alshaikh,Israa Alghanmi,Shelan Jeawak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AraTable is a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Arabic tabular data, highlighting performance gaps in complex reasoning tasks and proposing an automated evaluation framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the underrepresentation of Arabic in tabular data benchmarks and the limited performance of LLMs in interpreting structured Arabic data.

Method: A hybrid pipeline: LLMs generate initial content, which is filtered and verified by human experts to ensure dataset quality.

Result: LLMs perform well on simple tasks (e.g., direct QA) but struggle with deeper reasoning and fact verification.

Conclusion: AraTable is a valuable resource for advancing LLMs in Arabic structured data processing, with potential for future improvements in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The cognitive and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) have
enabled remarkable progress in natural language processing. However, their
performance in interpreting structured data, especially in tabular formats,
remains limited. Although benchmarks for English tabular data are widely
available, Arabic is still underrepresented because of the limited availability
of public resources and its unique language features. To address this gap, we
present AraTable, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
reasoning and understanding capabilities of LLMs when applied to Arabic tabular
data. AraTable consists of various evaluation tasks, such as direct question
answering, fact verification, and complex reasoning, involving a wide range of
Arabic tabular sources. Our methodology follows a hybrid pipeline, where
initial content is generated by LLMs and subsequently filtered and verified by
human experts to ensure high dataset quality. Initial analyses using AraTable
show that, while LLMs perform adequately on simpler tabular tasks such as
direct question answering, they continue to face significant cognitive
challenges when tasks require deeper reasoning and fact verification. This
indicates that there are substantial opportunities for future work to improve
performance on complex tabular reasoning tasks. We also propose a fully
automated evaluation framework that uses a self-deliberation mechanism and
achieves performance nearly identical to that of human judges. This research
provides a valuable, publicly available resource and evaluation framework that
can help accelerate the development of foundational models for processing and
analysing Arabic structured data.

TL;DR: Transformer-based model (XLM-RoBERTa-large) achieves high accuracy in restoring punctuation in Bangla text, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing readability and post-processing in ASR for low-resource languages like Bangla by addressing the lack of annotated data.

Method: Utilized XLM-RoBERTa-large for punctuation restoration, constructed a diverse training corpus, and applied data augmentation (alpha = 0.20%).

Result: Achieved 97.1% accuracy on News, 91.2% on Reference, and 90.2% on ASR test sets, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: Establishes a baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and provides public datasets and code for future low-resource NLP research.

Abstract: Punctuation restoration enhances the readability of text and is critical for
post-processing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), especially for
low-resource languages like Bangla. In this study, we explore the application
of transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa-large, to automatically
restore punctuation in unpunctuated Bangla text. We focus on predicting four
punctuation marks: period, comma, question mark, and exclamation mark across
diverse text domains. To address the scarcity of annotated resources, we
constructed a large, varied training corpus and applied data augmentation
techniques. Our best-performing model, trained with an augmentation factor of
alpha = 0.20%, achieves an accuracy of 97.1% on the News test set, 91.2% on the
Reference set, and 90.2% on the ASR set.
  Results show strong generalization to reference and ASR transcripts,
demonstrating the model's effectiveness in real-world, noisy scenarios. This
work establishes a strong baseline for Bangla punctuation restoration and
contributes publicly available datasets and code to support future research in
low-resource NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text, analyzing purpose, techniques, and evaluation methods, highlighting the rise of transformer architectures and utility-focused evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing clinical NLP challenges like sparsity and privacy by generating synthetic medical text.

Method: Systematic review of 94 articles from major databases, focusing on purpose, techniques (e.g., GPTs), and evaluation methods (e.g., utility).

Result: Synthetic text aids in augmentation, privacy, and NLP tasks, though privacy remains a concern. Transformer models dominate.

Conclusion: Synthetic medical text improves NLP workflows but requires more human assessment for privacy and sensitive data.

Abstract: Generating clinical synthetic text represents an effective solution for
common clinical NLP issues like sparsity and privacy. This paper aims to
conduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by
formulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)
the purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation
methods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,
Google Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating
synthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant
articles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given
to the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main
purpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,
corpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer
architectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,
especially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of
evaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where
utility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic
medical text. Although the generated synthetic medical text demonstrated a
moderate possibility to act as real medical documents in different downstream
NLP tasks, it has proven to be a great asset as augmented, complementary to the
real documents, towards improving the accuracy and overcoming
sparsity/undersampling issues. Yet, privacy is still a major issue behind
generating synthetic medical text, where more human assessments are needed to
check for the existence of any sensitive information. Despite that, advances in
generating synthetic medical text will considerably accelerate the adoption of
workflows and pipeline development, discarding the time-consuming legalities of
data transfer.

*Zheyu Zhang,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraDe improves LLM-based tabular data generation by integrating sparse dependency graphs into attention mechanisms, outperforming existing methods by up to 12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with sparse feature-level dependencies in tabular data, diluting attention on critical relationships.

Method: GraDe uses a dynamic graph learning module guided by functional dependencies to prioritize key feature interactions.

Result: GraDe outperforms existing LLM-based methods by up to 12% on complex datasets and matches state-of-the-art in synthetic data quality.

Conclusion: GraDe is a minimally intrusive, effective solution for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong potential for tabular data
generation by modeling textualized feature-value pairs. However, tabular data
inherently exhibits sparse feature-level dependencies, where many feature
interactions are structurally insignificant. This creates a fundamental
mismatch as LLMs' self-attention mechanism inevitably distributes focus across
all pairs, diluting attention on critical relationships, particularly in
datasets with complex dependencies or semantically ambiguous features. To
address this limitation, we propose GraDe (Graph-Guided Dependency Learning), a
novel method that explicitly integrates sparse dependency graphs into LLMs'
attention mechanism. GraDe employs a lightweight dynamic graph learning module
guided by externally extracted functional dependencies, prioritizing key
feature interactions while suppressing irrelevant ones. Our experiments across
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDe outperforms existing
LLM-based approaches by up to 12% on complex datasets while achieving
competitive results with state-of-the-art approaches in synthetic data quality.
Our method is minimally intrusive yet effective, offering a practical solution
for structure-aware tabular data modeling with LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMT methods struggle with rigid visual-linguistic alignment and limited inference to trained multimodal domains.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Multi30K and WMT benchmarks without images during inference.

Conclusion: GIIFT effectively bridges the modality gap and generalizes to broader image-free translation domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) has demonstrated the significant help of
visual information in machine translation. However, existing MMT methods face
challenges in leveraging the modality gap by enforcing rigid visual-linguistic
alignment whilst being confined to inference within their trained multimodal
domains. In this work, we construct novel multimodal scene graphs to preserve
and integrate modality-specific information and introduce GIIFT, a two-stage
Graph-guided Inductive Image-Free MMT framework that uses a cross-modal Graph
Attention Network adapter to learn multimodal knowledge in a unified fused
space and inductively generalize it to broader image-free translation domains.
Experimental results on the Multi30K dataset of English-to-French and
English-to-German tasks demonstrate that our GIIFT surpasses existing
approaches and achieves the state-of-the-art, even without images during
inference. Results on the WMT benchmark show significant improvements over the
image-free translation baselines, demonstrating the strength of GIIFT towards
inductive image-free inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional k-mer tokenization struggles with uneven token distribution and limited global context understanding in DNA sequences.

Method: Proposed merging 6-mer tokens with BPE-600 tokens to create a balanced, context-aware vocabulary for DLMs.

Result: Achieved prediction accuracies of 10.78% (3-mers), 10.1% (4-mers), and 4.12% (5-mers), surpassing models like NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER.

Conclusion: The hybrid strategy effectively captures local and global DNA patterns, advancing genomic language modeling for future biological research.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid tokenization strategy that enhances the
performance of DNA Language Models (DLMs) by combining 6-mer tokenization with
Byte Pair Encoding (BPE-600). Traditional k-mer tokenization is effective at
capturing local DNA sequence structures but often faces challenges, including
uneven token distribution and a limited understanding of global sequence
context. To address these limitations, we propose merging unique 6mer tokens
with optimally selected BPE tokens generated through 600 BPE cycles. This
hybrid approach ensures a balanced and context-aware vocabulary, enabling the
model to capture both short and long patterns within DNA sequences
simultaneously. A foundational DLM trained on this hybrid vocabulary was
evaluated using next-k-mer prediction as a fine-tuning task, demonstrating
significantly improved performance. The model achieved prediction accuracies of
10.78% for 3-mers, 10.1% for 4-mers, and 4.12% for 5-mers, outperforming
state-of-the-art models such as NT, DNABERT2, and GROVER. These results
highlight the ability of the hybrid tokenization strategy to preserve both the
local sequence structure and global contextual information in DNA modeling.
This work underscores the importance of advanced tokenization methods in
genomic language modeling and lays a robust foundation for future applications
in downstream DNA sequence analysis and biological research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WINO is a training-free decoding algorithm for DLLMs that improves the quality-speed trade-off by using a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DLLMs suffer from a severe quality-speed trade-off due to irreversible decoding, leading to performance degradation.

Method: WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism to revoke and refine suspicious tokens during decoding.

Result: WINO accelerates inference by 6× on GSM8K and 10× on Flickr30K while improving accuracy.

Conclusion: WINO effectively resolves the quality-speed trade-off in DLLMs, demonstrating superior performance in benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a compelling
alternative to Autoregressive models, designed for fast parallel generation.
However, existing DLLMs are plagued by a severe quality-speed trade-off, where
faster parallel decoding leads to significant performance degradation. We
attribute this to the irreversibility of standard decoding in DLLMs, which is
easily polarized into the wrong decoding direction along with early error
context accumulation. To resolve this, we introduce Wide-In, Narrow-Out (WINO),
a training-free decoding algorithm that enables revokable decoding in DLLMs.
WINO employs a parallel draft-and-verify mechanism, aggressively drafting
multiple tokens while simultaneously using the model's bidirectional context to
verify and re-mask suspicious ones for refinement. Verified in open-source
DLLMs like LLaDA and MMaDA, WINO is shown to decisively improve the
quality-speed trade-off. For instance, on the GSM8K math benchmark, it
accelerates inference by 6$\times$ while improving accuracy by 2.58%; on
Flickr30K captioning, it achieves a 10$\times$ speedup with higher performance.
More comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and
provide an in-depth understanding of WINO.

TL;DR: AQuilt is a framework for creating instruction-tuning data from unlabeled domain-specific data, improving LLM performance in specialized domains with lower costs and better task relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models underperform in specialized domains, and existing data synthesis methods are costly or lack generalization.

Method: AQuilt uses Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic, and Task type to generate high-quality instruction-tuning data.

Result: AQuilt matches DeepSeek-V3's performance at 17% of the cost and produces more task-relevant data.

Conclusion: AQuilt offers an efficient, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM performance in specialized domains.

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) in general
domains, they often underperform in specialized domains. Existing approaches
typically rely on data synthesis methods and yield promising results by using
unlabeled data to capture domain-specific features. However, these methods
either incur high computational costs or suffer from performance limitations,
while also demonstrating insufficient generalization across different tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose AQuilt, a framework for constructing
instruction-tuning data for any specialized domains from corresponding
unlabeled data, including Answer, Question, Unlabeled data, Inspection, Logic,
and Task type. By incorporating logic and inspection, we encourage reasoning
processes and self-inspection to enhance model performance. Moreover,
customizable task instructions enable high-quality data generation for any
task. As a result, we construct a dataset of 703k examples to train a powerful
data synthesis model. Experiments show that AQuilt is comparable to DeepSeek-V3
while utilizing just 17% of the production cost. Further analysis demonstrates
that our generated data exhibits higher relevance to downstream tasks. Source

TL;DR: TRPrompt unifies textual feedback and numerical rewards for prompt optimization, improving LLM reasoning without parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between heuristic-based and reward-trained prompt optimization methods for LLMs.

Method: Introduces TRPrompt, a framework combining textual feedback with prompt model training, iteratively improving prompts.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on GSMHard and MATH datasets.

Conclusion: TRPrompt effectively leverages textual rewards for superior prompt generation, enhancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Prompt optimization improves the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs) without requiring parameter updates to the target model. Following
heuristic-based "Think step by step" approaches, the field has evolved in two
main directions: while one group of methods uses textual feedback to elicit
improved prompts from general-purpose LLMs in a training-free way, a concurrent
line of research relies on numerical rewards to train a special prompt model,
tailored for providing optimal prompts to the target model. In this paper, we
introduce the Textual Reward Prompt framework (TRPrompt), which unifies these
approaches by directly incorporating textual feedback into training of the
prompt model. Our framework does not require prior dataset collection and is
being iteratively improved with the feedback on the generated prompts. When
coupled with the capacity of an LLM to internalize the notion of what a "good"
prompt is, the high-resolution signal provided by the textual rewards allows us
to train a prompt model yielding state-of-the-art query-specific prompts for
the problems from the challenging math datasets GSMHard and MATH.

Motivation: Adapt language models to better follow diverse user instructions by moving beyond fixed criteria like 'helpfulness' and 'harmfulness'.

Method: Propose Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback (RLCF), extracting checklists from instructions and combining AI judges and verifier programs to compute rewards.

Result: RLCF improves performance on all five benchmarks, with notable boosts in FollowBench (4 points), InFoBench (6 points), and Arena-Hard (3 points).

Conclusion: Checklist feedback is a powerful tool for enhancing language models' ability to support diverse user queries.

Abstract: Language models must be adapted to understand and follow user instructions.
Reinforcement learning is widely used to facilitate this -- typically using
fixed criteria such as "helpfulness" and "harmfulness". In our work, we instead
propose using flexible, instruction-specific criteria as a means of broadening
the impact that reinforcement learning can have in eliciting instruction
following. We propose "Reinforcement Learning from Checklist Feedback" (RLCF).
From instructions, we extract checklists and evaluate how well responses
satisfy each item - using both AI judges and specialized verifier programs -
then combine these scores to compute rewards for RL. We compare RLCF with other
alignment methods applied to a strong instruction following model
(Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct) on five widely-studied benchmarks -- RLCF is the only
method to improve performance on every benchmark, including a 4-point boost in
hard satisfaction rate on FollowBench, a 6-point increase on InFoBench, and a
3-point rise in win rate on Arena-Hard. These results establish checklist
feedback as a key tool for improving language models' support of queries that

*Yujia Tong,Jingling Yuan,Chuang Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QuaRC is a QAT framework for edge devices that uses coreset selection and cascaded layer correction to reduce quantization errors and improve model performance with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient deployment of low-bit quantized models on edge devices, coupled with privacy concerns requiring local data processing, drives the development of QuaRC.

Method: QuaRC employs Relative Entropy Score for coreset selection and Cascaded Layer Correction to align quantized and full-precision model outputs.

Result: QuaRC improves Top-1 accuracy by 5.72% on ResNet-18 (2-bit) with a 1% data subset on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: QuaRC effectively addresses quantization errors and performance degradation in small-scale datasets, making it suitable for edge device deployment.

Abstract: With the development of mobile and edge computing, the demand for low-bit
quantized models on edge devices is increasing to achieve efficient deployment.
To enhance the performance, it is often necessary to retrain the quantized
models using edge data. However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive
data can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing
Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective
solution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for
training, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques
can mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.
However, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the
model when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to
significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,
a QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main
phases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy
Score" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's
quantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded
Layer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the
quantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively
reducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when
quantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%
improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to
state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A low-complexity AI model using a generative adversarial network with causality-invariant learning improves semantic communication by extracting causal and non-causal representations for robust data reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance semantic communication by ensuring consistent and reliable data reconstruction across diverse domains despite evolving user-collected data.

Method: Proposes a generative adversarial network with causality-invariant learning to extract causal (invariant) and non-causal representations, coupled with sparse update protocols to minimize communication overhead.

Result: Causality-invariant knowledge ensures consistency across devices, improves classification tasks, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR for data reconstruction.

Conclusion: The model effectively captures semantic knowledge, ensures domain consistency, and achieves superior performance in data reconstruction, making it robust for semantic communication.

Abstract: In this study, we design a low-complexity and generalized AI model that can
capture common knowledge to improve data reconstruction of the channel decoder
for semantic communication. Specifically, we propose a generative adversarial
network that leverages causality-invariant learning to extract causal and
non-causal representations from the data. Causal representations are invariant
and encompass crucial information to identify the data's label. They can
encapsulate semantic knowledge and facilitate effective data reconstruction at
the receiver. Moreover, the causal mechanism ensures that learned
representations remain consistent across different domains, making the system
reliable even with users collecting data from diverse domains. As
user-collected data evolves over time causing knowledge divergence among users,
we design sparse update protocols to improve the invariant properties of the
knowledge while minimizing communication overheads. Three key observations were
drawn from our empirical evaluations. Firstly, causality-invariant knowledge
ensures consistency across different devices despite the diverse training data.
Secondly, invariant knowledge has promising performance in classification
tasks, which is pivotal for goal-oriented semantic communications. Thirdly, our
knowledge-based data reconstruction highlights the robustness of our decoder,
which surpasses other state-of-the-art data reconstruction and semantic
compression methods in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).

*Jingyi Ding,Chengwen Qi,Hongfei Wang,Jianshe Wu,Licheng Jiao,Yuwei Guo,Jian Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how self-similarity in feature networks affects deep neural networks' performance, proposing a method to analyze and optimize it, showing up to 6% improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of quantitative analysis on how self-similarity in hidden space geometry influences weight optimization and neuron dynamics.

Method: Proposes a complex network modeling method based on hidden-layer neuron outputs to study feature network self-similarity and its impact on performance.

Result: Self-similarity varies by architecture; embedding constraints during training improves performance by up to 6% in MLP and attention architectures.

Conclusion: Adjusting feature network self-similarity enhances deep neural network performance, with architecture-specific effects.

Abstract: Current research has found that some deep neural networks exhibit strong
hierarchical self-similarity in feature representation or parameter
distribution. However, aside from preliminary studies on how the power-law
distribution of weights across different training stages affects model
performance,there has been no quantitative analysis on how the self-similarity
of hidden space geometry influences model weight optimization, nor is there a
clear understanding of the dynamic behavior of internal neurons. Therefore,
this paper proposes a complex network modeling method based on the output
features of hidden-layer neurons to investigate the self-similarity of feature
networks constructed at different hidden layers, and analyzes how adjusting the
degree of self-similarity in feature networks can enhance the classification
performance of deep neural networks. Validated on three types of networks MLP
architectures, convolutional networks, and attention architectures this study
reveals that the degree of self-similarity exhibited by feature networks varies
across different model architectures. Furthermore, embedding constraints on the
self-similarity of feature networks during the training process can improve the
performance of self-similar deep neural networks (MLP architectures and
attention architectures) by up to 6 percentage points.

*Florian Sobieczky,Alfredo Lopez,Erika Dudkin,Christopher Lackner,Matthias Hochsteger,Bernhard Scheichl,Helmut Sobieczky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based adaptive optimization algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization, focusing on dimensionality reduction and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize computational effort and interpret optimization results for understanding flow-field extrema.

Method: Uses a surrogate-based, actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach with temporal parameter freezing. Local optimized parameter changes around CFD simulations guide global optimization.

Result: Demonstrated on a simple fluid-dynamical problem, enabling feature importance scoring and efficient optimization.

Conclusion: The method effectively reduces computational effort and provides interpretable results for aerodynamic optimization.

Abstract: We introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) based adaptive optimization
algorithm for aerodynamic shape optimization focused on dimensionality
reduction. The form in which RL is applied here is that of a surrogate-based,
actor-critic policy evaluation MCMC approach allowing for temporal 'freezing'
of some of the parameters to be optimized. The goals are to minimize
computational effort, and to use the observed optimization results for
interpretation of the discovered extrema in terms of their role in achieving
the desired flow-field.
  By a sequence of local optimized parameter changes around intermediate CFD
simulations acting as ground truth, it is possible to speed up the global
optimization if (a) the local neighbourhoods of the parameters in which the
changed parameters must reside are sufficiently large to compete with the
grid-sized steps and its large number of simulations, and (b) the estimates of
the rewards and costs on these neighbourhoods necessary for a good step-wise
parameter adaption are sufficiently accurate. We give an example of a simple
fluid-dynamical problem on which the method allows interpretation in the sense
of a feature importance scoring.

### [166] [Hyperbolic Deep Learning for Foundation Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17787)
*Neil He,Hiren Madhu,Ngoc Bui,Menglin Yang,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the limitations of Euclidean geometry in foundation models and proposes hyperbolic spaces as a better alternative for embedding hierarchical structures and power-law distributions, enhancing reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models like LLMs and VLMs face limitations in representational capacity, adaptability, and scalability, prompting the exploration of non-Euclidean geometries for better alignment with real-world data.

Method: The paper reviews hyperbolic neural networks, leveraging their properties (e.g., low-distortion embeddings for hierarchical structures) to enhance foundation models.

Result: Hyperbolic spaces improve reasoning, zero-shot generalization, and cross-modal alignment in foundation models while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: The paper highlights hyperbolic spaces' potential for advancing foundation models and outlines future research directions to address remaining challenges.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on massive datasets, including large language
models (LLMs), vision-language models (VLMs), and large multimodal models, have
demonstrated remarkable success in diverse downstream tasks. However, recent
studies have shown fundamental limitations of these models: (1) limited
representational capacity, (2) lower adaptability, and (3) diminishing
scalability. These shortcomings raise a critical question: is Euclidean
geometry truly the optimal inductive bias for all foundation models, or could
incorporating alternative geometric spaces enable models to better align with
the intrinsic structure of real-world data and improve reasoning processes?
Hyperbolic spaces, a class of non-Euclidean manifolds characterized by
exponential volume growth with respect to distance, offer a mathematically
grounded solution. These spaces enable low-distortion embeddings of
hierarchical structures (e.g., trees, taxonomies) and power-law distributions
with substantially fewer dimensions compared to Euclidean counterparts. Recent
advances have leveraged these properties to enhance foundation models,
including improving LLMs' complex reasoning ability, VLMs' zero-shot
generalization, and cross-modal semantic alignment, while maintaining parameter
efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive review of hyperbolic neural
networks and their recent development for foundation models. We further outline
key challenges and research directions to advance the field.

### [167] [Adaptive Repetition for Mitigating Position Bias in LLM-Based Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17788)
*Ali Vardasbi,Gustavo Penha,Claudia Hauff,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses position bias and low repetition consistency in LLMs during ranking tasks, proposing a dynamic early-stopping method to reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit position bias and inconsistency in rankings, requiring costly repetition strategies. A per-instance mitigation approach is needed.

Method: Introduces a dynamic early-stopping method to adaptively determine repetitions per instance, with a confidence-based variant.

Result: Reduces LLM calls by 81-87% compared to static repetition, preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: Dynamic repetition strategies efficiently mitigate bias and inconsistency in LLMs, balancing cost and performance.

Abstract: When using LLMs to rank items based on given criteria, or evaluate answers,
the order of candidate items can influence the model's final decision. This
sensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.
Prior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its
severity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs
also exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the
LLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To
address both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple
times with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority
voting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases
computational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the
direction -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --
and magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within
a single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance
mitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method
that adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each
instance. Evaluating our approach across three LLMs of varying sizes and on two
tasks, namely re-ranking and alignment, we demonstrate that transitioning to a
dynamic repetition strategy reduces the number of LLM calls by an average of
81%, while preserving the accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a confidence-based
adaptation to our early-stopping method, reducing LLM calls by an average of
87% compared to static repetition, with only a slight accuracy trade-off
relative to our original early-stopping method.

*Jingyi Yu,Tim Pychynski,Marco F. Huber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CICME is a three-step method for inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous data, leveraging causal transfer learning to identify domain-invariant mechanisms and guide individual domain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand complex sensor systems through causality by addressing the challenge of inferring causal mechanisms from heterogeneous multi-domain data.

Method: CICME uses causal transfer learning (CTL) to detect domain-invariant causal mechanisms, then guides individual domain estimation. Evaluated on linear Gaussian models in manufacturing-inspired scenarios.

Result: CICME outperforms baseline methods by combining pooled and individual domain causal discovery, showing reliability in detecting common mechanisms.

Conclusion: CICME effectively infers causal mechanisms in heterogeneous data, demonstrating superior performance in certain scenarios compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: To gain deeper insights into a complex sensor system through the lens of
causality, we present common and individual causal mechanism estimation
(CICME), a novel three-step approach to inferring causal mechanisms from
heterogeneous data collected across multiple domains. By leveraging the
principle of Causal Transfer Learning (CTL), CICME is able to reliably detect
domain-invariant causal mechanisms when provided with sufficient samples. The
identified common causal mechanisms are further used to guide the estimation of
the remaining causal mechanisms in each domain individually. The performance of
CICME is evaluated on linear Gaussian models under scenarios inspired from a
manufacturing process. Building upon existing continuous optimization-based
causal discovery methods, we show that CICME leverages the benefits of applying
causal discovery on the pooled data and repeatedly on data from individual
domains, and it even outperforms both baseline methods under certain scenarios.

*Shiyuan Zhang,Tong Li,Zhu Xiao,Hongyang Du,Kaibin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LSDM, an LLM-enhanced spatio-temporal diffusion model, improves mobile traffic prediction by integrating diffusion models and transformers, achieving better accuracy and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile traffic prediction methods struggle with adaptability across urban environments and accuracy due to high uncertainty and lack of contextual data.

Method: LSDM combines diffusion models for distribution modeling and transformers for adaptive learning, enhanced by LLMs for contextual understanding.

Result: LSDM outperforms existing models, improving prediction accuracy by 2.83% (R²) and reducing RMSE by 8.29% compared to CSDI.

Conclusion: LSDM offers a robust solution for service-level traffic prediction, leveraging advanced modeling and contextual data for superior performance.

Abstract: Service-level mobile traffic prediction for individual users is essential for
network efficiency and quality of service enhancement. However, current
prediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban
environments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in
personal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the
complex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand
advanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and
rich environmental features. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models
in distribution modeling and Large Language Models (LLMs) in contextual
understanding, we propose an LLM-Enhanced Spatio-temporal Diffusion Model
(LSDM). LSDM integrates the generative power of diffusion models with the
adaptive learning capabilities of transformers, augmented by the ability to
capture multimodal environmental information for modeling service-level
patterns and dynamics. Extensive evaluations on real-world service-level
datasets demonstrate that the model excels in traffic usage predictions,
showing outstanding generalization and adaptability. After incorporating
contextual information via LLM, the performance improves by at least 2.83% in
terms of the coefficient of determination. Compared to models of a similar
type, such as CSDI, the root mean squared error can be reduced by at least
8.29%. The code and dataset will be available at:

TL;DR: CoCAI combines generative AI and copula modeling for accurate forecasting and robust anomaly detection in multivariate time-series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multivariate time-series analysis, such as accurate predictions and anomaly detection.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based model for dependencies, conformal prediction for calibration, and copula-based modeling for anomaly detection.

Result: Effective in forecasting and identifying anomalies in real-world water and sewerage systems data.

Conclusion: CoCAI provides statistically valid predictions and robust anomaly detection with minimal deployment overhead.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that harnesses the power of generative
artificial intelligence and copula-based modeling to address two critical
challenges in multivariate time-series analysis: delivering accurate
predictions and enabling robust anomaly detection. Our method, Copula-based
Conformal Anomaly Identification for Multivariate Time-Series (CoCAI),
leverages a diffusion-based model to capture complex dependencies within the
data, enabling high quality forecasting. The model's outputs are further
calibrated using a conformal prediction technique, yielding predictive regions
which are statistically valid, i.e., cover the true target values with a
desired confidence level. Starting from these calibrated forecasts, robust
outlier detection is performed by combining dimensionality reduction techniques
with copula-based modeling, providing a statistically grounded anomaly score.
CoCAI benefits from an offline calibration phase that allows for minimal
overhead during deployment and delivers actionable results rooted in
established theoretical foundations. Empirical tests conducted on real
operational data derived from water distribution and sewerage systems confirm
CoCAI's effectiveness in accurately forecasting target sequences of data and in
identifying anomalous segments within them.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenSelect leverages LLMs' comparative reasoning to efficiently select the best solution among multiple candidates, outperforming pointwise and pairwise methods in math reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods (pointwise or pairwise) underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities or scale poorly with larger sampling budgets.

Method: Introduces GenSelect, where LLMs use long reasoning to select the best solution from N candidates, scaling efficiently with parallel sampling.

Result: GenSelect outperforms existing scoring methods in math reasoning tasks, as demonstrated with models like QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528.

Conclusion: GenSelect effectively combines LLMs' comparative strengths with scalable parallel sampling, offering a superior approach for reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Generative reward models with parallel sampling have enabled effective
test-time scaling for reasoning tasks. Current approaches employ pointwise
scoring of individual solutions or pairwise comparisons. However, pointwise
methods underutilize LLMs' comparative abilities, while pairwise methods scale
inefficiently with larger sampling budgets. We introduce GenSelect, where the
LLM uses long reasoning to select the best solution among N candidates. This
leverages LLMs' comparative strengths while scaling efficiently across parallel
sampling budgets. For math reasoning, we demonstrate that reasoning models,
such as QwQ and DeepSeek-R1-0528, excel at GenSelect, outperforming existing
scoring approaches with simple prompting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using WGAN for high-resolution precipitation downscaling, improving perceptual realism despite slightly lower conventional metric performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution precipitation prediction is challenging but crucial for mitigating damage from localized heavy rainfall.

Method: Uses Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with optimal transport cost for precipitation downscaling.

Result: WGAN produces visually realistic precipitation fields with fine-scale structures, though slightly underperforms on conventional metrics. Critic scores correlate with human perceptual realism.

Conclusion: WGAN enhances perceptual realism in precipitation downscaling and provides a new evaluation perspective for precipitation datasets.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) precipitation prediction is essential for reducing
damage from stationary and localized heavy rainfall; however, HR precipitation
forecasts using process-driven numerical weather prediction models remains
challenging. This study proposes using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial
Network (WGAN) to perform precipitation downscaling with an optimal transport
cost. In contrast to a conventional neural network trained with mean squared
error, the WGAN generated visually realistic precipitation fields with
fine-scale structures even though the WGAN exhibited slightly lower performance
on conventional evaluation metrics. The learned critic of WGAN correlated well
with human perceptual realism. Case-based analysis revealed that large
discrepancies in critic scores can help identify both unrealistic WGAN outputs
and potential artifacts in the reference data. These findings suggest that the
WGAN framework not only improves perceptual realism in precipitation
downscaling but also offers a new perspective for evaluating and
quality-controlling precipitation datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphEXT is a novel explainability framework for GNNs that uses cooperative game theory and social externalities to quantify node importance by analyzing interactions and structural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The 'black-box' nature of GNNs and the lack of effective methods to capture node interaction patterns drive the need for improved explainability.

Method: GraphEXT partitions nodes into coalitions, decomposes the graph into subgraphs, and uses the Shapley value under externalities to measure node contributions.

Result: GraphEXT outperforms existing methods in fidelity across various GNN architectures, enhancing model explainability.

Conclusion: GraphEXT effectively addresses GNN explainability by focusing on node interactions and structural impacts, validated by superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved outstanding performance across a
wide range of graph-related tasks. However, their "black-box" nature poses
significant challenges to their explainability, and existing methods often fail
to effectively capture the intricate interaction patterns among nodes within
the network. In this work, we propose a novel explainability framework,
GraphEXT, which leverages cooperative game theory and the concept of social
externalities. GraphEXT partitions graph nodes into coalitions, decomposing the
original graph into independent subgraphs. By integrating graph structure as an
externality and incorporating the Shapley value under externalities, GraphEXT
quantifies node importance through their marginal contributions to GNN
predictions as the nodes transition between coalitions. Unlike traditional
Shapley value-based methods that primarily focus on node attributes, our
GraphEXT places greater emphasis on the interactions among nodes and the impact
of structural changes on GNN predictions. Experimental studies on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that GraphEXT outperforms existing
baseline methods in terms of fidelity across diverse GNN architectures ,
significantly enhancing the explainability of GNN models.

TL;DR: Molecular task arithmetic trains models on negative examples to learn property directions, enabling zero-shot, dual-objective, and few-shot molecule design with high diversity and success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of positive molecules by leveraging abundant negative examples to learn property directions without labeled positive data.

Method: Proposes molecular task arithmetic: training on negative examples to learn property directions and moving models in opposite directions to generate positive molecules.

Result: Outperforms models trained on positive molecules in zero-shot experiments, increasing design diversity while maintaining desirable properties.

Conclusion: Molecular task arithmetic is a simple, data-efficient, and effective transfer learning strategy for de novo molecule design.

Abstract: The scarcity of molecules with desirable properties (i.e., 'positive'
molecules) is an inherent bottleneck for generative molecule design. To
sidestep such obstacle, here we propose molecular task arithmetic: training a
model on diverse and abundant negative examples to learn 'property directions'
$--$ without accessing any positively labeled data $--$ and moving models in
the opposite property directions to generate positive molecules. When analyzed
on 20 zero-shot design experiments, molecular task arithmetic generated more
diverse and successful designs than models trained on positive molecules.
Moreover, we employed molecular task arithmetic in dual-objective and few-shot
design tasks. We find that molecular task arithmetic can consistently increase
the diversity of designs while maintaining desirable design properties. With
its simplicity, data efficiency, and performance, molecular task arithmetic
bears the potential to become the $\textit{de-facto}$ transfer learning
strategy for de novo molecule design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of learning dynamics in stochastic systems, particularly for non-periodic inputs, where standard architectures like FNO fall short.

Method: Extends FNO with mirror padding, enabling handling of non-periodic inputs. Uses theoretical analysis (Wong-Zakai theorems) and empirical validation.

Result: MFNO approximates stochastic solutions accurately, generalizes well across resolutions, and outperforms baselines (LSTMs, TCNs, DeepONet) in speed and performance.

Conclusion: MFNO is a robust and efficient solution for stochastic systems, offering theoretical guarantees and practical advantages over existing methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces an operator-based neural network, the mirror-padded
Fourier neural operator (MFNO), designed to learn the dynamics of stochastic
systems. MFNO extends the standard Fourier neural operator (FNO) by
incorporating mirror padding, enabling it to handle non-periodic inputs. We
rigorously prove that MFNOs can approximate solutions of path-dependent
stochastic differential equations and Lipschitz transformations of fractional
Brownian motions to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. Our theoretical analysis
builds on Wong--Zakai type theorems and various approximation techniques.
Empirically, the MFNO exhibits strong resolution generalization--a property
rarely seen in standard architectures such as LSTMs, TCNs, and DeepONet.
Furthermore, our model achieves performance that is comparable or superior to
these baselines while offering significantly faster sample path generation than
classical numerical schemes.

*Amrith Setlur,Pratiksha Thaker,Jonathan Ullman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper extends lower bounds for public-private learning to cases with significant distribution shift, showing public data's limited benefit under large shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complementary value of public and private data in machine learning when distribution shifts exist.

Method: Extends known lower bounds to scenarios with distribution shift, focusing on Gaussian mean estimation and linear regression.

Result: Public data is beneficial only for small shifts; for large shifts, it provides no advantage.

Conclusion: Public data's utility in private learning depends on the magnitude of distribution shift.

Abstract: The most effective differentially private machine learning algorithms in
practice rely on an additional source of purportedly public data. This paradigm
is most interesting when the two sources combine to be more than the sum of
their parts. However, there are settings such as mean estimation where we have
strong lower bounds, showing that when the two data sources have the same
distribution, there is no complementary value to combining the two data
sources. In this work we extend the known lower bounds for public-private
learning to setting where the two data sources exhibit significant distribution
shift. Our results apply to both Gaussian mean estimation where the two
distributions have different means, and to Gaussian linear regression where the
two distributions exhibit parameter shift. We find that when the shift is small
(relative to the desired accuracy), either public or private data must be
sufficiently abundant to estimate the private parameter. Conversely, when the
shift is large, public data provides no benefit.

TL;DR: The paper explores Federated Learning (FL) in cloud robotic manipulation, highlighting its benefits and challenges compared to classical ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of classical ML in robotic tasks by leveraging FL for distributed, privacy-preserving model training.

Method: Discusses FL concepts and their application to cloud robotic manipulation, proposing centralized or decentralized FL model designs.

Result: Identifies FL's potential to enhance robotic manipulation through distributed computing, while noting challenges in scalability and reliability.

Conclusion: FL offers promising solutions for cloud robotic manipulation but requires further research to address its challenges.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm,
where the collaborative training of a model involves dynamic participation of
devices to achieve broad objectives. In contrast, classical machine learning
(ML) typically requires data to be located on-premises for training, whereas FL
leverages numerous user devices to train a shared global model without the need
to share private data. Current robotic manipulation tasks are constrained by
the individual capabilities and speed of robots due to limited low-latency
computing resources. Consequently, the concept of cloud robotics has emerged,
allowing robotic applications to harness the flexibility and reliability of
computing resources, effectively alleviating their computational demands across
the cloud-edge continuum. Undoubtedly, within this distributed computing
context, as exemplified in cloud robotic manipulation scenarios, FL offers
manifold advantages while also presenting several challenges and opportunities.
In this paper, we present fundamental concepts of FL and their connection to
cloud robotic manipulation. Additionally, we envision the opportunities and
challenges associated with realizing efficient and reliable cloud robotic
manipulation at scale through FL, where researchers adopt to design and verify
FL models in either centralized or decentralized settings.

TL;DR: The study introduces a deep learning-based generative framework (pVAE) for inverse design of porous metamaterials with tailored hydraulic properties, reducing computational costs and enabling efficient exploration of structure-property relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the inverse design of porous metamaterials with tailored hydraulic properties (e.g., porosity, permeability) using a deep learning approach, addressing computational inefficiencies of traditional methods like LBM.

Method: Developed a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE) combining VAE with a regressor, trained on synthetic and real foam datasets. Used CNN for property prediction and LBM for limited permeability data.

Result: The pVAE framework successfully generates metamaterials with desired properties, maps microstructural features into an interpretable latent space, and reduces computational costs.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient inverse design of porous metamaterials, with open-access datasets and codes provided for further research.

Abstract: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore the inverse design of porous
metamaterials using a deep learning-based generative framework. Specifically,
we develop a property-variational autoencoder (pVAE), a variational autoencoder
(VAE) augmented with a regressor, to generate structured metamaterials with
tailored hydraulic properties, such as porosity and permeability. While this
work uses the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate intrinsic permeability
tensor data for limited porous microstructures, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) is trained using a bottom-up approach to predict effective hydraulic
properties. This significantly reduces the computational cost compared to
direct LBM simulations. The pVAE framework is trained on two datasets: a
synthetic dataset of artificial porous microstructures and CT-scan images of
volume elements from real open-cell foams. The encoder-decoder architecture of
the VAE captures key microstructural features, mapping them into a compact and
interpretable latent space for efficient structure-property exploration. The
study provides a detailed analysis and interpretation of the latent space,
demonstrating its role in structure-property mapping, interpolation, and
inverse design. This approach facilitates the generation of new metamaterials
with desired properties. The datasets and codes used in this study will be made
open-access to support further research.

Conclusion: SETOL provides a robust theoretical framework for understanding NN performance, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: We present a SemiEmpirical Theory of Learning (SETOL) that explains the
remarkable performance of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) Neural Networks (NNs). We
provide a formal explanation of the origin of the fundamental quantities in the
phenomenological theory of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR): the
heavy-tailed power-law layer quality metrics, alpha and alpha-hat. In prior
work, these metrics have been shown to predict trends in the test accuracies of
pretrained SOTA NN models, importantly, without needing access to either
testing or training data. Our SETOL uses techniques from statistical mechanics
as well as advanced methods from random matrix theory and quantum chemistry.
The derivation suggests new mathematical preconditions for ideal learning,
including a new metric, ERG, which is equivalent to applying a single step of
the Wilson Exact Renormalization Group. We test the assumptions and predictions
of SETOL on a simple 3-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), demonstrating
excellent agreement with the key theoretical assumptions. For SOTA NN models,
we show how to estimate the individual layer qualities of a trained NN by
simply computing the empirical spectral density (ESD) of the layer weight
matrices and plugging this ESD into our SETOL formulas. Notably, we examine the
performance of the HTSR alpha and the SETOL ERG layer quality metrics, and find
that they align remarkably well, both on our MLP and on SOTA NNs.

*Jessica Quaye,Charvi Rastogi,Alicia Parrish,Oana Inel,Minsuk Kahng,Lora Aroyo,Vijay Janapa Reddi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seed2Harvest combines human and machine methods to create diverse adversarial prompts for robust T2I model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current adversarial prompt datasets are either small and imbalanced (human-crafted) or lack realism (synthetic). A hybrid approach is needed.

Method: Seed2Harvest uses a hybrid red-teaming method to expand human-crafted adversarial prompts while preserving human-like attack patterns.

Result: The method achieves high diversity (535 locations, 7.48 entropy) and maintains strong attack success rates (e.g., 0.31 NudeNet).

Conclusion: Human-machine collaboration is key for scalable and comprehensive T2I model safety evaluation.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have become prevalent across numerous
applications, making their robust evaluation against adversarial attacks a
critical priority. Continuous access to new and challenging adversarial prompts
across diverse domains is essential for stress-testing these models for
resilience against novel attacks from multiple vectors. Current techniques for
generating such prompts are either entirely authored by humans or synthetically
generated. On the one hand, datasets of human-crafted adversarial prompts are
often too small in size and imbalanced in their cultural and contextual
representation. On the other hand, datasets of synthetically-generated prompts
achieve scale, but typically lack the realistic nuances and creative
adversarial strategies found in human-crafted prompts. To combine the strengths
of both human and machine approaches, we propose Seed2Harvest, a hybrid
red-teaming method for guided expansion of culturally diverse, human-crafted
adversarial prompt seeds. The resulting prompts preserve the characteristics
and attack patterns of human prompts while maintaining comparable average
attack success rates (0.31 NudeNet, 0.36 SD NSFW, 0.12 Q16). Our expanded
dataset achieves substantially higher diversity with 535 unique geographic
locations and a Shannon entropy of 7.48, compared to 58 locations and 5.28
entropy in the original dataset. Our work demonstrates the importance of
human-machine collaboration in leveraging human creativity and machine
computational capacity to achieve comprehensive, scalable red-teaming for
continuous T2I model safety evaluation.

*Hongrong Yang,Markus Schlaepfer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanPulse is a scalable deep learning framework for ultra-fine-grained city-wide population flow prediction, overcoming limitations of traditional and deep learning methods by treating each POI as a node and using transfer learning for cross-city generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate population flow prediction is crucial for urban planning, transportation, and public health, but existing methods suffer from static assumptions, poor generalization, high computational costs, and low resolution.

Method: UrbanPulse combines a temporal graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model spatiotemporal dependencies. It uses a three-stage transfer learning strategy: pretraining, cold-start adaptation, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluated on 103 million GPS records from three California metropolitan areas, UrbanPulse achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability.

Conclusion: UrbanPulse advances high-resolution urban forecasting, making it practical for diverse cities through efficient transfer learning.

Abstract: Accurate population flow prediction is essential for urban planning,
transportation management, and public health. Yet existing methods face key
limitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep
learning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language
Models (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial
structure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points
of Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their
utility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep
learning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow
predictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal
graph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model
multi-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across
urban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:
pretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and
reinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS
records from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and scalability. Through efficient transfer learning,
UrbanPulse takes a key step toward making high-resolution, AI-powered urban
forecasting deployable in practice across diverse cities.

*Xiaoxu Guo,Siyan Liang,Yachao Cui,Juxiang Zhou,Lei Wang,Han Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MFTRR, a framework for post-quality assessment using multimodal data and relational reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to leverage multimodal cues, introduce noise, and lack complex semantic relationship capture, limiting post-quality assessment.

Method: MFTRR reframes the task as ranking, using Local-Global Semantic Correlation Reasoning and Multi-Level Evidential Relational Reasoning modules.

Result: MFTRR achieves up to 9.52% NDCG@3 improvement over unimodal methods on the Art History dataset.

Conclusion: MFTRR effectively addresses limitations of existing methods by mimicking human cognitive processes and leveraging multimodal data.

Abstract: Accurately assessing post quality requires complex relational reasoning to
capture nuanced topic-post relationships. However, existing studies face three
major limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which
fails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)
introducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;
and (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like
relevance and comprehensiveness. To address these issues, we propose the
Multimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,
which mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment
as a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality
variations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic
Correlation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions
between posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum
information fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level
Evidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level
relational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on
three newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public
Lazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3
improvement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset.

overall in the Algonauts 2025 Challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper improves GeoAggregator (GA) by optimizing its pipeline for computational efficiency and enhancing explainability using model ensembling and GeoShapley. Results show better accuracy, speed, and effective spatial effect capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) is crucial for understanding geospatial phenomena, and existing methods like GA need further improvements in efficiency and explainability.

Method: The authors optimize GA's dataloading and forward pass for efficiency, and incorporate model ensembling and GeoShapley-based explanations.

Result: The improved GA shows higher prediction accuracy, faster inference, and effectively captures spatial effects in synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The enhanced GA model, with its efficient pipeline and explainability features, is publicly available for community use.

Abstract: Accurate modeling and explaining geospatial tabular data (GTD) are critical
for understanding geospatial phenomena and their underlying processes. Recent
work has proposed a novel transformer-based deep learning model named
GeoAggregator (GA) for this purpose, and has demonstrated that it outperforms
other statistical and machine learning approaches. In this short paper, we
further improve GA by 1) developing an optimized pipeline that accelerates the
dataloading process and streamlines the forward pass of GA to achieve better
computational efficiency; and 2) incorporating a model ensembling strategy and
a post-hoc model explanation function based on the GeoShapley framework to
enhance model explainability. We validate the functionality and efficiency of
the proposed strategies by applying the improved GA model to synthetic
datasets. Experimental results show that our implementation improves the
prediction accuracy and inference speed of GA compared to the original
implementation. Moreover, explanation experiments indicate that GA can
effectively captures the inherent spatial effects in the designed synthetic
dataset. The complete pipeline has been made publicly available for community
use (https://github.com/ruid7181/GA-sklearn).

*Shubham Mohole,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SIFOTL is a privacy-compliant method for identifying data shifts in tabular datasets, outperforming baselines with high F1 scores even under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like privacy restrictions and noise hinder analysis of data shifts, especially in healthcare.

Method: SIFOTL uses summary statistics, twin XGBoost models with LLM assistance, and a Pareto-weighted decision tree for interpretable segment identification.

Result: Achieves F1 scores of 0.85-0.96 in real-world tests, outperforming baselines (F1=0.19-0.67).

Conclusion: SIFOTL offers a robust, interpretable, and privacy-safe solution for data shift analysis.

Abstract: Identifying the factors driving data shifts in tabular datasets is a
significant challenge for analysis and decision support systems, especially
those focusing on healthcare. Privacy rules restrict data access, and noise
from complex processes hinders analysis. To address this challenge, we propose
SIFOTL (Statistically-Informed Fidelity-Optimization Method for Tabular
Learning) that (i) extracts privacy-compliant data summary statistics, (ii)
employs twin XGBoost models to disentangle intervention signals from noise with
assistance from LLMs, and (iii) merges XGBoost outputs via a Pareto-weighted
decision tree to identify interpretable segments responsible for the shift.
Unlike existing analyses which may ignore noise or require full data access for
LLM-based analysis, SIFOTL addresses both challenges using only privacy-safe
summary statistics. Demonstrating its real-world efficacy, for a MEPS panel
dataset mimicking a new Medicare drug subsidy, SIFOTL achieves an F1 score of
0.85, substantially outperforming BigQuery Contribution Analysis (F1=0.46) and
statistical tests (F1=0.20) in identifying the segment receiving the subsidy.
Furthermore, across 18 diverse EHR datasets generated based on Synthea ABM,
SIFOTL sustains F1 scores of 0.86-0.96 without noise and >= 0.75 even with
injected observational noise, whereas baseline average F1 scores range from
0.19-0.67 under the same tests. SIFOTL, therefore, provides an interpretable,
privacy-conscious workflow that is empirically robust to observational noise.

TL;DR: A novel learning paradigm, Machine Unlearning TSEP, is introduced to allow traffic state estimation and prediction models to selectively forget sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data, addressing privacy and trust concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy, cybersecurity, and data freshness concerns in data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) erode public trust. Regulations like the 'right to be forgotten' necessitate solutions beyond simple data removal.

Method: The study proposes Machine Unlearning TSEP, a learning paradigm enabling trained models to selectively forget specific data.

Result: The approach aims to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of TSEP models by addressing privacy and data integrity issues.

Conclusion: Machine Unlearning TSEP offers a promising solution to privacy and trust challenges in data-driven traffic systems.

Abstract: Data-driven traffic state estimation and prediction (TSEP) relies heavily on
data sources that contain sensitive information. While the abundance of data
has fueled significant breakthroughs, particularly in machine learning-based
methods, it also raises concerns regarding privacy, cybersecurity, and data
freshness. These issues can erode public trust in intelligent transportation
systems. Recently, regulations have introduced the "right to be forgotten",
allowing users to request the removal of their private data from models. As
machine learning models can remember old data, simply removing it from back-end
databases is insufficient in such systems. To address these challenges, this
study introduces a novel learning paradigm for TSEP-Machine Unlearning
TSEP-which enables a trained TSEP model to selectively forget
privacy-sensitive, poisoned, or outdated data. By empowering models to
"unlearn," we aim to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of data-driven
traffic TSEP.

Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO is computationally expensive, necessitating a method to optimize resource usage.

Method: Proposes a predictive framework modeling training dynamics, deriving empirical scaling laws from experiments on Llama and Qwen models.

Result: Identifies three training phases (slow start, rapid improvement, plateau) and suggests early stopping to reduce compute without performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes across models, offering a practical guide for efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks using
reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
is computationally expensive. To address this, we propose a predictive
framework that models training dynamics and helps optimize resource usage.
Through experiments on Llama and Qwen models (3B 8B), we derive an empirical
scaling law based on model size, initial performance, and training progress.
This law predicts reward trajectories and identifies three consistent training
phases: slow start, rapid improvement, and plateau. We find that training
beyond certain number of an epoch offers little gain, suggesting earlier
stopping can significantly reduce compute without sacrificing performance. Our
approach generalizes across model types, providing a practical guide for
efficient GRPO-based fine-tuning.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using neural operators is introduced to solve PDEs and downscale ocean current data, providing high-resolution solutions for applications like coastal management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution ocean current data is crucial for coastal management and safety, but existing satellite data lacks sufficient spatial granularity.

Method: A supervised deep learning framework based on neural operators is proposed to solve PDEs and downscale data, enabling arbitrary resolution solutions.

Result: The model was tested on real-world Copernicus data and synthetic Navier-Stokes datasets, demonstrating its ability to predict high-resolution solutions.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the resolution limitations of current ocean data, offering scalable solutions for detailed local analyses.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of physical systems governed by partial differential
equations is a central challenge in scientific computing. In oceanography,
high-resolution current data are critical for coastal management, environmental
monitoring, and maritime safety. However, available satellite products, such as
Copernicus data for sea water velocity at ~0.08 degrees spatial resolution and
global ocean models, often lack the spatial granularity required for detailed
local analyses. In this work, we (a) introduce a supervised deep learning
framework based on neural operators for solving PDEs and providing arbitrary
resolution solutions, and (b) propose downscaling models with an application to
Copernicus ocean current data. Additionally, our method can model surrogate
PDEs and predict solutions at arbitrary resolution, regardless of the input
resolution. We evaluated our model on real-world Copernicus ocean current data
and synthetic Navier-Stokes simulation datasets.

ratios, GSPO defines the importance ratio based on sequence likelihood and
performs sequence-level clipping, rewarding, and optimization. We demonstrate
that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the
GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and
has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits
of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3

TL;DR: C-AAE combines an Anonymizing AutoEncoder (AAE) with ADPCM to protect user privacy in wearable sensor data while maintaining activity recognition accuracy and reducing data volume.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wearable sensors capture behavioral data that can re-identify users, posing privacy risks in healthcare applications.

Method: C-AAE uses an AAE to suppress identity cues in sensor data and ADPCM to further anonymize and compress the data.

Result: C-AAE reduces re-identification F1 scores by 10-15%, keeps activity recognition F1 within 5% of baseline, and cuts data volume by 75%.

Conclusion: C-AAE effectively balances privacy and utility for sensor-based healthcare applications.

Abstract: Wearable accelerometers and gyroscopes encode fine-grained behavioural
signatures that can be exploited to re-identify users, making privacy
protection essential for healthcare applications. We introduce C-AAE, a
compressive anonymizing autoencoder that marries an Anonymizing AutoEncoder
(AAE) with Adaptive Differential Pulse-Code Modulation (ADPCM). The AAE first
projects raw sensor windows into a latent space that retains activity-relevant
features while suppressing identity cues. ADPCM then differentially encodes
this latent stream, further masking residual identity information and shrinking
the bitrate. Experiments on the MotionSense and PAMAP2 datasets show that C-AAE
cuts user re-identification F1 scores by 10-15 percentage points relative to
AAE alone, while keeping activity-recognition F1 within 5 percentage points of
the unprotected baseline. ADPCM also reduces data volume by roughly 75 %,
easing transmission and storage overheads. These results demonstrate that C-AAE
offers a practical route to balancing privacy and utility in continuous,
sensor-based activity recognition for healthcare.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision PTQ framework that reduces LLM weights by 10 times, achieving 1.6 bits per weight, with innovations PBAR and FIAS to mitigate performance degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to high computational costs and massive parameters. Ultra low-bit quantization often degrades performance, necessitating a better solution.

Method: Squeeze10-LLM uses a staged mixed-precision PTQ framework, quantizing 80% of weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. It introduces PBAR (refined weight significance metric) and FIAS (full activation preservation) to improve accuracy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1.6 bits per weight, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on zero-shot tasks compared to existing PTQ methods.

Conclusion: Squeeze10-LLM effectively balances compression and performance, making LLM deployment more feasible with minimal accuracy loss.

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive
parameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can
significantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression
(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To
address this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively "squeezing" 16-bit LLMs'
weights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits
per weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We
introduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation
Robustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a
refined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization
on activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that
preserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate
cumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2
show that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit
weight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six
zero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.
Our code will be released upon publication.

*Kosuke Sugiyama,Masato Uchida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework to analyze how additional supervision (beyond hard labels) improves classification model accuracy, revealing that distribution over non-hard-labeled classes is key.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited training data and the need for high-accuracy models motivate exploring additional supervision (e.g., label confidences) to enhance label information.

Method: A theoretical framework treats hard labels and additional supervision as distributions, combining them via affine combinations to refine soft labels.

Result: The analysis shows that non-hard-labeled class distribution is crucial, and additional supervision and mixing coefficients refine labels in complementary ways.

Conclusion: The framework theoretically and experimentally demonstrates improved classification accuracy by leveraging additional supervision.

Abstract: In scenarios where training data is limited due to observation costs or data
scarcity, enriching the label information associated with each instance becomes
crucial for building high-accuracy classification models. In such contexts, it
is often feasible to obtain not only hard labels but also {\it additional
supervision}, such as the confidences for the hard labels. This setting
naturally raises fundamental questions: {\it What kinds of additional
supervision are intrinsically beneficial?} And {\it how do they contribute to
improved generalization performance?} To address these questions, we propose a
theoretical framework that treats both hard labels and additional supervision
as probability distributions, and constructs soft labels through their affine
combination. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the essential component of
additional supervision is not the confidence score of the assigned hard label,
but rather the information of the distribution over the non-hard-labeled
classes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the
mixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary
roles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision
determines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing
the hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the
mixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction. Through
generalization error analysis, we theoretically characterize how the additional
supervision and its mixing coefficient affect both the convergence rate and
asymptotic value of the error bound. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate
that, based on our theory, designing additional supervision can lead to
improved classification accuracy, even when utilized in a simple manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize PRB utilization for MVNOs in O-RAN while meeting probabilistic delay constraints, improving over existing DRL models.

Method: Derived a reward function using LLN, adapted it for real-world use, and proposed PDA-DRL. Introduced reward-based model weight personalization for MVNOs.

Result: PDA-DRL reduced average delay by 38% over baselines. Reward-based personalization outperformed traditional methods like federated averaging.

Conclusion: PDA-DRL and reward-based personalization effectively address RAN slicing challenges, offering superior performance and robustness for MVNOs.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the challenge of radio access network (RAN) slicing
within an open RAN (O-RAN) architecture. Our focus centers on a network that
includes multiple mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) competing for
physical resource blocks (PRBs) with the goal of meeting probabilistic delay
upper bound constraints for their clients while minimizing PRB utilization.
Initially, we derive a reward function based on the law of large numbers (LLN),
then implement practical modifications to adapt it for real-world experimental
scenarios. We then propose our solution, the Percentile-based Delay-Aware Deep
Reinforcement Learning (PDA-DRL), which demonstrates its superiority over
several baselines, including DRL models optimized for average delay
constraints, by achieving a 38\% reduction in resultant average delay.
Furthermore, we delve into the issue of model weight sharing among multiple
MVNOs to develop a robust personalized model. We introduce a reward-based
personalization method where each agent prioritizes other agents' model weights
based on their performance. This technique surpasses traditional aggregation
methods, such as federated averaging, and strategies reliant on traffic
patterns and model weight distance similarities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of adversarial attacks on RL systems without modifying the environment or policy, enhancing practicality.

Method: Uses a reward iteration optimization framework with LLMs to generate adversarial rewards and a critical state identification algorithm to target vulnerabilities.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over existing methods in diverse environments by effectively inducing suboptimal decision-making.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical and effective approach to adversarial attacks in RL, leveraging LLMs and critical state analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in fields like
robotics and autonomous driving, but adversarial attacks designed to mislead RL
systems remain challenging. Existing approaches often rely on modifying the
environment or policy, limiting their practicality. This paper proposes an
adversarial attack method in which existing agents in the environment guide the
target policy to output suboptimal actions without altering the environment. We
propose a reward iteration optimization framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate adversarial rewards explicitly tailored to the
vulnerabilities of the target agent, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
inducing the target agent toward suboptimal decision-making. Additionally, a
critical state identification algorithm is designed to pinpoint the target
agent's most vulnerable states, where suboptimal behavior from the victim leads
to significant degradation in overall performance. Experimental results in
diverse environments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
approaches.

### [196] [Maximizing Prefix-Confidence at Test-Time Efficiently Improves Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18122)
*Matthias Otth,Jonas Hübotter,Ido Hakimi,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Language models self-improve by using their own confidence to select predictions, achieving better performance in math tasks without external signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how language models can scale at test-time for mathematical reasoning by leveraging their own confidence.

Method: Uses prefix-confidence scaling to select the most promising attempts, evaluated on five math datasets.

Result: Prefix-confidence scaling outperforms majority voting and is less biased than BoN, with 32-token prefixes being optimal.

Conclusion: Prefix-confidence scaling is effective for math tasks, but test-time training doesn't surpass it.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that language models can self-improve by maximizing
their own confidence in their predictions, without relying on external
verifiers or reward signals. In this work, we study the test-time scaling of
language models for mathematical reasoning tasks, where the model's own
confidence is used to select the most promising attempts. Surprisingly, we find
that we can achieve significant performance gains by continuing only the most
promising attempt, selected by the model's prefix-confidence. We systematically
evaluate prefix-confidence scaling on five mathematical reasoning datasets: the
school-level GSM8K and MATH500, and the competition-level AMC23, AIME24, and
AIME25. We find that prefix-confidence scaling with prefixes of only 32 tokens
achieves a better accuracy-compute trade-off than majority voting. Moreover,
prefix-confidence scaling appears less susceptible than BoN to length biases.
Finally, we also evaluate test-time training with prefix-confidence and find
that, while outperforming the base model, it does not improve over
prefix-confidence scaling.

### [198] [When Noisy Labels Meet Class Imbalance on Graphs: A Graph Augmentation Method with LLM and Pseudo Label](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18153)
*Riting Xia,Rucong Wang,Yulin Liu,Anchen Li,Xueyan Liu,Yan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphALP is a novel framework using LLMs and pseudo-labeling to address class-imbalanced graph node classification with noisy labels, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world graphs often have noisy labels and class imbalance, but existing methods assume clean labels. This gap motivates the need for robust solutions.

Method: GraphALP combines LLM-based oversampling for minority nodes, dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling for noise reduction, and secondary LLM-guided oversampling to balance class distribution.

Result: GraphALP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

Conclusion: GraphALP effectively addresses class imbalance and label noise in graphs, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced graph node classification is a practical yet underexplored
research problem. Although recent studies have attempted to address this issue,
they typically assume clean and reliable labels when processing
class-imbalanced graphs. This assumption often violates the nature of
real-world graphs, where labels frequently contain noise. Given this gap, this
paper systematically investigates robust node classification for
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels. We propose GraphALP, a novel Graph
Augmentation framework based on Large language models (LLMs) and
Pseudo-labeling techniques. Specifically, we design an LLM-based oversampling
method to generate synthetic minority nodes, producing label-accurate minority
nodes to alleviate class imbalance. Based on the class-balanced graphs, we
develop a dynamically weighted pseudo-labeling method to obtain high-confidence
pseudo labels to reduce label noise ratio. Additionally, we implement a
secondary LLM-guided oversampling mechanism to mitigate potential class
distribution skew caused by pseudo labels. Experimental results show that
GraphALP achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods on
class-imbalanced graphs with noisy labels.

*Jianchao Wang,Qingfeng Li,Pengcheng Zheng,Xiaorong Pu,Yazhou Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChronoSelect is a novel framework for learning with noisy labels, using a four-stage memory architecture and sliding updates to dynamically partition samples into clean, boundary, and noisy subsets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for learning with noisy labels lack temporal dynamics, leading to degraded generalization. ChronoSelect addresses this by leveraging learning evolution.

Method: Proposes a four-stage memory architecture with sliding updates and controlled decay, compressing prediction history into temporal distributions for sample partitioning.

Result: Theoretical guarantees confirm convergence and stability; experiments show superior performance on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: ChronoSelect effectively handles noisy labels by integrating temporal dynamics, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks on real-world datasets is often hampered by the
presence of noisy labels, which can be memorized by over-parameterized models,
leading to significant degradation in generalization performance. While
existing methods for learning with noisy labels (LNL) have made considerable
progress, they fundamentally suffer from static snapshot evaluations and fail
to leverage the rich temporal dynamics of learning evolution. In this paper, we
propose ChronoSelect (chrono denoting its temporal nature), a novel framework
featuring an innovative four-stage memory architecture that compresses
prediction history into compact temporal distributions. Our unique sliding
update mechanism with controlled decay maintains only four dynamic memory units
per sample, progressively emphasizing recent patterns while retaining essential
historical knowledge. This enables precise three-way sample partitioning into
clean, boundary, and noisy subsets through temporal trajectory analysis and
dual-branch consistency. Theoretical guarantees prove the mechanism's
convergence and stability under noisy conditions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate ChronoSelect's state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new GNN-based method improves generalization in autonomous driving by using a heterogeneous graph and multi-staged goal classification for trajectory prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for predicting traffic participant trajectories lack generalization to unseen areas, causing performance drops.

Method: A Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a heterogeneous graph (traffic participants and vectorized road network) classifies goals in a multi-staged approach.

Result: The method shows better generalization in cross-dataset evaluations (trained on Argoverse2, tested on NuScenes).

Conclusion: The proposed GNN with goal classification enhances generalization for autonomous driving in unseen scenarios.

Abstract: To achieve full autonomous driving, a good understanding of the surrounding
environment is necessary. Especially predicting the future states of other
traffic participants imposes a non-trivial challenge. Current SotA-models
already show promising results when trained on real datasets (e.g. Argoverse2,
NuScenes). Problems arise when these models are deployed to new/unseen areas.
Typically, performance drops significantly, indicating that the models lack
generalization. In this work, we introduce a new Graph Neural Network (GNN)
that utilizes a heterogeneous graph consisting of traffic participants and
vectorized road network. Latter, is used to classify goals, i.e. endpoints of
the predicted trajectories, in a multi-staged approach, leading to a better
generalization to unseen scenarios. We show the effectiveness of the goal
selection process via cross-dataset evaluation, i.e. training on Argoverse2 and
evaluating on NuScenes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedSA-GCL is a semi-asynchronous federated framework for graph learning, addressing inefficiencies of synchronous methods and limitations of current AFL approaches by leveraging graph topology and label distribution divergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGL methods rely on synchronous communication, which is inefficient, while AFL methods ignore graph data's unique properties, risking semantic drift.

Method: Proposes FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous framework using ClusterCast to account for graph topology and label divergence. Evaluated on real-world datasets with Louvain and Metis splits.

Result: Outperforms 9 baselines by 2.92% (Louvain) and 3.4% (Metis), demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: FedSA-GCL effectively addresses inefficiencies and inconsistencies in FGL, offering a practical solution for distributed graph learning.

Abstract: Federated Graph Learning (FGL) is a distributed learning paradigm that
enables collaborative training over large-scale subgraphs located on multiple
local systems. However, most existing FGL approaches rely on synchronous
communication, which leads to inefficiencies and is often impractical in
real-world deployments. Meanwhile, current asynchronous federated learning
(AFL) methods are primarily designed for conventional tasks such as image
classification and natural language processing, without accounting for the
unique topological properties of graph data. Directly applying these methods to
graph learning can possibly result in semantic drift and representational
inconsistency in the global model. To address these challenges, we propose
FedSA-GCL, a semi-asynchronous federated framework that leverages both
inter-client label distribution divergence and graph topological
characteristics through a novel ClusterCast mechanism for efficient training.
We evaluate FedSA-GCL on multiple real-world graph datasets using the Louvain
and Metis split algorithms, and compare it against 9 baselines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves strong robustness and
outstanding efficiency, outperforming the baselines by an average of 2.92% with
the Louvain and by 3.4% with the Metis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SINDy-LOM combines sparse regression with library optimization to improve model accuracy and usability by optimizing basis functions for long-term prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SINDy struggles with library design for complex systems. SINDy-LOM aims to automate and optimize this process.

Method: Uses a two-layer optimization: inner-layer for sparse regression and outer-layer for optimizing parametrized basis functions based on recursive long-term prediction accuracy.

Result: Produces interpretable, parsimonious models with reduced user burden and improved reliability over traditional SINDy.

Conclusion: SINDy-LOM is validated on a diesel engine airpath system, showing effectiveness for complex industrial applications.

Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover
the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where
the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given
basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which
is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not
trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study
proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a
combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy
of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.
The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the
inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear
combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the
basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term
(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the
optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model
has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the
parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces
user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting
model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the
one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is
demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a
well-known complex industrial system.

Motivation: To empirically evaluate the effectiveness of totally corrective boosting methods based on linear programming, which have been theoretically appealing but understudied.

Method: Study six LP-based boosting formulations (including NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost) across 20 datasets, using heuristic and optimal base learners, and analyzing accuracy, sparsity, margins, anytime performance, and hyperparameter sensitivity.

Result: Totally corrective methods match or outperform XGBoost/LightGBM with shallow trees, produce sparser ensembles, and can thin pre-trained ensembles without performance loss.

Conclusion: LP-based boosting methods are viable alternatives to heuristics, offering sparsity and performance benefits, though optimal decision trees have limitations.

Abstract: Despite their theoretical appeal, totally corrective boosting methods based
on linear programming have received limited empirical attention. In this paper,
we conduct the first large-scale experimental study of six LP-based boosting
formulations, including two novel methods, NM-Boost and QRLP-Boost, across 20
diverse datasets. We evaluate the use of both heuristic and optimal base
learners within these formulations, and analyze not only accuracy, but also
ensemble sparsity, margin distribution, anytime performance, and hyperparameter
sensitivity. We show that totally corrective methods can outperform or match
state-of-the-art heuristics like XGBoost and LightGBM when using shallow trees,
while producing significantly sparser ensembles. We further show that these
methods can thin pre-trained ensembles without sacrificing performance, and we
highlight both the strengths and limitations of using optimal decision trees in
this context.

TL;DR: SiamSA-PPM is a self-supervised learning framework for Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) that uses Siamese learning and statistical augmentation to address data limitations in real-world event logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning PPM approaches struggle with low variability and small size of real-world event logs, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: SiamSA-PPM combines Siamese learning with three novel statistically grounded transformation methods to generate realistic trace variants and learn generalizable representations without labeled supervision.

Result: SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior performance in next activity and final outcome prediction tasks, with statistical augmentation outperforming random transformations.

Conclusion: SiamSA-PPM is a promising approach for training data enrichment in process prediction, improving variability and performance.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) enables forecasting future events or
outcomes of ongoing business process instances based on event logs. However,
deep learning PPM approaches are often limited by the low variability and small
size of real-world event logs. To address this, we introduce SiamSA-PPM, a
novel self-supervised learning framework that combines Siamese learning with
Statistical Augmentation for Predictive Process Monitoring. It employs three
novel statistically grounded transformation methods that leverage control-flow
semantics and frequent behavioral patterns to generate realistic, semantically
valid new trace variants. These augmented views are used within a Siamese
learning setup to learn generalizable representations of process prefixes
without the need for labeled supervision. Extensive experiments on real-life
event logs demonstrate that SiamSA-PPM achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to the SOTA in both next activity and final outcome
prediction tasks. Our results further show that statistical augmentation
significantly outperforms random transformations and improves variability in
the data, highlighting SiamSA-PPM as a promising direction for training data
enrichment in process prediction.

TL;DR: An algorithm for coarsening unstructured grids using differentiable physics, k-means clustering, autodifferentiation, and stochastic minimization, achieving up to 10x reduction in grid points while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational load in numerical simulations necessitates methods to reduce problem size without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Uses k-means clustering, autodifferentiation, and stochastic minimization to coarsen grids. Tested on linear parabolic and wave equations.

Result: Achieved up to 10x reduction in grid points while preserving dynamics in points of interest.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for systems described by evolutionary PDEs.

Abstract: Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there is a
demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable
physics. We achieve this by employing k-means clustering, autodifferentiation
and stochastic minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the
designed algorithm on two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs
slightly compressible fluid flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our
results show that in the considered scenarios, we reduced the number of grid
points up to 10 times while preserving the modeled variable dynamics in the
points of interest. The proposed approach can be applied to the simulation of
an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial differential equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses security regression in continual learning (CL)-based malware detectors, proposing a regression-aware penalty to mitigate harmful prediction changes while maintaining detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware evolves rapidly, making full retraining impractical. CL offers scalability but risks security regression, where previously detected malware evades detection after updates, undermining trust.

Method: The authors formalize and quantify security regression, adapting Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to CL to preserve prior predictive behavior model-agnostically.

Result: Experiments on ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show the method effectively reduces regression across CL scenarios while maintaining strong detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed regression-aware penalty mitigates security regression in CL-based malware detectors, ensuring reliable updates without compromising detection accuracy.

Abstract: Malware evolves rapidly, forcing machine learning (ML)-based detectors to
adapt continuously. With antivirus vendors processing hundreds of thousands of
new samples daily, datasets can grow to billions of examples, making full
retraining impractical. Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a scalable
alternative, enabling incremental updates without full data access while
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we analyze a critical yet
overlooked issue in this context: security regression. Unlike forgetting, which
manifests as a general performance drop on previously seen data, security
regression captures harmful prediction changes at the sample level, such as a
malware sample that was once correctly detected but evades detection after a
model update. Although often overlooked, regressions pose serious risks in
security-critical applications, as the silent reintroduction of previously
detected threats in the system may undermine users' trust in the whole updating
process. To address this issue, we formalize and quantify security regression
in CL-based malware detectors and propose a regression-aware penalty to
mitigate it. Specifically, we adapt Positive Congruent Training (PCT) to the CL
setting, preserving prior predictive behavior in a model-agnostic manner.
Experiments on the ELSA, Tesseract, and AZ-Class datasets show that our method
effectively reduces regression across different CL scenarios while maintaining
strong detection performance over time.

TL;DR: A novel architecture, TIDSIT, is proposed for accurate battery State of Health (SoH) estimation, addressing irregularities in real-world discharge cycle data and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Battery health monitoring is critical due to degradation impacting efficiency and safety, but existing models struggle with irregular real-world data.

Method: TIDSIT uses continuous time embeddings and temporal attention mechanisms to handle irregular and variable-length discharge cycle data without information loss.

Result: TIDSIT reduces prediction error by over 50% and achieves SoH prediction error below 0.58% on the NASA dataset.

Conclusion: TIDSIT is effective for battery SoH estimation and generalizable for other irregular time-series health monitoring tasks.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of battery-powered vehicles and energy storage systems
over the past decade has made battery health monitoring increasingly critical.
Batteries play a central role in the efficiency and safety of these systems,
yet they inevitably degrade over time due to repeated charge-discharge cycles.
This degradation leads to reduced energy efficiency and potential overheating,
posing significant safety concerns. Accurate estimation of a State of Health
(SoH) of battery is therefore essential for ensuring operational reliability
and safety. Several machine learning architectures, such as LSTMs,
transformers, and encoder-based models, have been proposed to estimate SoH from
discharge cycle data. However, these models struggle with the irregularities
inherent in real-world measurements: discharge readings are often recorded at
non-uniform intervals, and the lengths of discharge cycles vary significantly.
To address this, most existing approaches extract features from the sequences
rather than processing them in full, which introduces information loss and
compromises accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
architecture: Time-Informed Dynamic Sequence Inverted Transformer (TIDSIT).
TIDSIT incorporates continuous time embeddings to effectively represent
irregularly sampled data and utilizes padded sequences with temporal attention
mechanisms to manage variable-length inputs without discarding sequence
information. Experimental results on the NASA battery degradation dataset show
that TIDSIT significantly outperforms existing models, achieving over 50%
reduction in prediction error and maintaining an SoH prediction error below
0.58%. Furthermore, the architecture is generalizable and holds promise for
broader applications in health monitoring tasks involving irregular time-series
data.

*Kale-ab Abebe Tessera,Leonard Hinckeldey,Riccardo Zamboni,David Abel,Amos Storkey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Current MARL methods rely on simple conventions, not effective Markov signal recovery, leading to brittle policies. Task design flaws, not model limitations, are the issue. New environments should enforce observation-based behaviors and memory reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the shortcomings of current MARL benchmarks and advocate for better-designed cooperative environments that test core Dec-POMDP assumptions.

Method: Analyzed empirical success of MARL algorithms through a case study, comparing brittle conventions with grounded policies.

Result: Found that co-adapting agents learn fragile conventions, failing with non-adaptive partners. Task design flaws, not model limitations, are the root issue.

Conclusion: Proposes new MARL environments emphasizing observation-based behaviors and memory reasoning to ensure genuine skill over brittle conventions.

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is typically formalised
as a Decentralised Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP),
where agents must reason about the environment and other agents' behaviour. In
practice, current model-free MARL algorithms use simple recurrent function
approximators to address the challenge of reasoning about others using partial
information. In this position paper, we argue that the empirical success of
these methods is not due to effective Markov signal recovery, but rather to
learning simple conventions that bypass environment observations and memory.
Through a targeted case study, we show that co-adapting agents can learn
brittle conventions, which then fail when partnered with non-adaptive agents.
Crucially, the same models can learn grounded policies when the task design
necessitates it, revealing that the issue is not a fundamental limitation of
the learning models but a failure of the benchmark design. Our analysis also
suggests that modern MARL environments may not adequately test the core
assumptions of Dec-POMDPs. We therefore advocate for new cooperative
environments built upon two core principles: (1) behaviours grounded in
observations and (2) memory-based reasoning about other agents, ensuring
success requires genuine skill rather than fragile, co-adapted agreements.

TL;DR: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets reduce complexity and improve performance in operator learning by using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to decompose hypernetwork output weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory and computational costs of HyperDeepONets while maintaining or improving expressivity and performance.

Method: Introduces PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets, leveraging LoRA to decompose the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into smaller low-rank matrices, reducing trainable parameters and adding regularization.

Result: Achieves up to 70% parameter reduction and consistently outperforms regular HyperDeepONets in predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets offer a more efficient and effective alternative for operator learning in physics-informed machine learning.

Abstract: HyperDeepONets were introduced in Lee, Cho and Hwang [ICLR, 2023] as an
alternative architecture for operator learning, in which a hypernetwork
generates the weights for the trunk net of a DeepONet. While this improves
expressivity, it incurs high memory and computational costs due to the large
number of output parameters required. In this work we introduce, in the
physics-informed machine learning setting, a variation, PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets,
which leverage low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to reduce complexity by decomposing
the hypernetwork's output layer weight matrix into two smaller low-rank
matrices. This reduces the number of trainable parameters while introducing an
extra regularization of the trunk networks' weights. Through extensive
experiments on both ordinary and partial differential equations we show that
PI-LoRA-HyperDeepONets achieve up to 70\% reduction in parameters and
consistently outperform regular HyperDeepONets in terms of predictive accuracy
and generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for efficient uncertainty estimation in LLMs by distilling uncertainty-aware teacher models into compact student models using LoRA, achieving comparable performance with fewer computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard LLMs struggle with accurate uncertainty quantification, and existing Bayesian/ensemble methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Distill teacher models (requiring multiple forward passes) into student models using LoRA, comparing softmax-based and Dirichlet-distributed outputs for uncertainty modeling.

Result: Student models achieve comparable or better predictive and uncertainty performance than teachers, with only one forward pass.

Conclusion: Evidential distillation enables robust and efficient uncertainty quantification in LLMs, a novel advancement.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty quantification remains a key challenge for standard
LLMs, prompting the adoption of Bayesian and ensemble-based methods. However,
such methods typically necessitate computationally expensive sampling,
involving multiple forward passes to effectively estimate predictive
uncertainty.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach enabling efficient and effective
uncertainty estimation in LLMs without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we distill uncertainty-aware teacher models - originally requiring multiple
forward passes - into compact student models sharing the same architecture but
fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We compare two distinct
distillation strategies: one in which the student employs traditional
softmax-based outputs, and another in which the student leverages
Dirichlet-distributed outputs to explicitly model epistemic uncertainty via
evidential learning.
  Empirical evaluations on classification datasets demonstrate that such
students can achieve comparable or superior predictive and uncertainty
quantification performance relative to their teacher models, while critically
requiring only a single forward pass. To our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that immediate and robust uncertainty quantification can be
achieved in LLMs through evidential distillation.

### [212] [Multi-Model Ensemble and Reservoir Computing for River Discharge Prediction in Ungauged Basins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18423)
*Mizuki Funato,Yohei Sawada*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HYPER combines multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing for efficient, accurate flood prediction, especially in data-scarce regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate flood prediction and water management in regions with limited river discharge observations.

Method: Uses Bayesian model averaging on 43 uncalibrated hydrological models, then trains a reservoir computing model for error correction. Weights are inferred for ungauged basins using catchment attributes.

Result: HYPER matches LSTM performance in data-rich scenarios (KGE 0.56 vs. 0.55) with 95% less computational time. In data-scarce scenarios, HYPER outperforms LSTM (KGE 0.55 vs. -0.04).

Conclusion: HYPER offers a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge prediction, particularly in ungauged basins.

Abstract: Despite the critical need for accurate flood prediction and water management,
many regions lack sufficient river discharge observations, limiting the skill
of rainfall-runoff analyses. Although numerous physically based and machine
learning models exist, achieving high accuracy, interpretability, and
computational efficiency under data-scarce conditions remains a major
challenge. We address this challenge with a novel method, HYdrological
Prediction with multi-model Ensemble and Reservoir computing (HYPER) that
leverages multi-model ensemble and reservoir computing (RC). Our approach first
applies Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to 43 "uncalibrated" catchment-based
conceptual hydrological models. An RC model is then trained via linear
regression to correct errors in the BMA output, a non-iterative process that
ensures high computational efficiency. For ungauged basins, we infer the
required BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged
basins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from
87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta
Efficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)
but required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%
of basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower
uncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).
These results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not
necessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is
assembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction. HYPER
provides a robust, efficient, and generalizable solution for discharge
prediction, particularly in ungauged basins, making it applicable to a wide
range of regions.

### [213] [Revisiting Bisimulation Metric for Robust Representations in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18519)
*Leiji Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Xin Li,Yao-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper critiques the conventional bisimulation metric in reinforcement learning, identifying two flaws: inadequate representation of distinctive scenarios and reliance on fixed weights. It proposes a revised metric with a precise reward gap definition and adaptive coefficients, supported by theory and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional bisimulation metric has limitations in representing distinctive scenarios and uses fixed weights, which may not suit all training stages or tasks. The authors aim to improve its adaptability and precision.

Method: The authors introduce a revised bisimulation metric with a more precise reward gap definition and adaptive update operators. They provide theoretical convergence guarantees and validate the method experimentally.

Result: The proposed metric shows improved representation distinctiveness and adaptability, supported by theoretical analysis and successful experiments on DeepMind Control and Meta-World benchmarks.

Conclusion: The revised bisimulation metric addresses the limitations of the conventional approach, offering better adaptability and precision, with theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Bisimulation metric has long been regarded as an effective control-related
representation learning technique in various reinforcement learning tasks.
However, in this paper, we identify two main issues with the conventional
bisimulation metric: 1) an inability to represent certain distinctive
scenarios, and 2) a reliance on predefined weights for differences in rewards
and subsequent states during recursive updates. We find that the first issue
arises from an imprecise definition of the reward gap, whereas the second issue
stems from overlooking the varying importance of reward difference and
next-state distinctions across different training stages and task settings. To
address these issues, by introducing a measure for state-action pairs, we
propose a revised bisimulation metric that features a more precise definition
of reward gap and novel update operators with adaptive coefficient. We also
offer theoretical guarantees of convergence for our proposed metric and its
improved representation distinctiveness. In addition to our rigorous
theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive experiments on two representative
benchmarks, DeepMind Control and Meta-World, demonstrating the effectiveness of
our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLANCE improves GNN performance on heterophilous graphs by integrating logic-guided reasoning, dynamic refinement, and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs struggle with heterophilous graphs due to indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and lack of higher-order structural patterns.

Method: GLANCE combines logic layers, attention-based edge pruning, and clustering for better representation learning.

Result: GLANCE outperforms benchmarks on datasets like Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin.

Conclusion: GLANCE is a lightweight, adaptable, and interpretable solution for heterophilous graphs.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant success in
learning from graph-structured data but often struggle on heterophilous graphs,
where connected nodes differ in features or class labels. This limitation
arises from indiscriminate neighbor aggregation and insufficient incorporation
of higher-order structural patterns. To address these challenges, we propose
GLANCE (Graph Logic Attention Network with Cluster Enhancement), a novel
framework that integrates logic-guided reasoning, dynamic graph refinement, and
adaptive clustering to enhance graph representation learning. GLANCE combines a
logic layer for interpretable and structured embeddings, multi-head
attention-based edge pruning for denoising graph structures, and clustering
mechanisms for capturing global patterns. Experimental results in benchmark
datasets, including Cornell, Texas, and Wisconsin, demonstrate that GLANCE
achieves competitive performance, offering robust and interpretable solutions
for heterophilous graph scenarios. The proposed framework is lightweight,
adaptable, and uniquely suited to the challenges of heterophilous graphs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C2G-KD is a data-free knowledge distillation method using a class-conditional generator guided by a teacher model and PCA-derived geometric constraints, achieving effective synthetic training with minimal real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable knowledge distillation without access to real training data, leveraging synthetic samples generated by a teacher model and geometric constraints.

Method: Train a class-conditional generator using semantic and structural losses, guided by a frozen teacher model and PCA subspaces from few real examples.

Result: Experiments on MNIST demonstrate the framework's ability to generate useful synthetic training data with minimal class structure.

Conclusion: C2G-KD successfully bootstraps synthetic training pipelines using minimal real data, preserving topological consistency and diversity.

Abstract: We introduce C2G-KD, a data-free knowledge distillation framework where a
class-conditional generator is trained to produce synthetic samples guided by a
frozen teacher model and geometric constraints derived from PCA. The generator
never observes real training data but instead learns to activate the teacher's
output through a combination of semantic and structural losses. By constraining
generated samples to lie within class-specific PCA subspaces estimated from as
few as two real examples per class, we preserve topological consistency and
diversity. Experiments on MNIST show that even minimal class structure is
sufficient to bootstrap useful synthetic training pipelines.

### [216] [The Price equation reveals a universal force-metric-bias law of algorithmic learning and natural selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18549)
*Steven A. Frank*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a universal FMB law (Force-Metric-Bias) using the Price equation, unifying diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection under a common mathematical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reveal the shared mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate learning and optimization processes, enabling a unified understanding and design of algorithms.

Method: The Price equation partitions change into force, metric, bias, and noise components, formalized as Δθ = Mf + b + ξ. This framework is applied to various algorithms.

Result: The FMB law unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating, Newton's method, gradient descent, and other algorithms, showing why metrics like Fisher information and KL divergence arise naturally.

Conclusion: The FMB law provides a principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning algorithms across disciplines.

Abstract: Diverse learning algorithms, optimization methods, and natural selection
share a common mathematical structure, despite their apparent differences. Here
I show that a simple notational partitioning of change by the Price equation
reveals a universal force-metric-bias (FMB) law: $\Delta\mathbf{\theta} =
\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{f} + \mathbf{b} + \mathbf{\xi}$. The force $\mathbf{f}$
drives improvement in parameters, $\Delta\mathbf{\theta}$, through the
covariance between the parameters and performance. The metric $\mathbf{M}$
rescales movement by inverse curvature. The bias $\mathbf{b}$ adds momentum or
changes in the frame of reference. The noise $\mathbf{\xi}$ enables
exploration. This framework unifies natural selection, Bayesian updating,
Newton's method, stochastic gradient descent, stochastic Langevin dynamics,
Adam optimization, and most other algorithms as special cases of the same
underlying process. The Price equation also reveals why Fisher information,
Kullback-Leibler divergence, and d'Alembert's principle arise naturally in
learning dynamics. By exposing this common structure, the FMB law provides a
principled foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing learning
algorithms across disciplines.

### [217] [The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553)
*Jiale Chen,Torsten Hoefler,Dan Alistarh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPTQ, a method for quantizing LLM weights, is mathematically equivalent to Babai's nearest plane algorithm, providing geometric insights and error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical foundations of GPTQ and its equivalence to classical lattice algorithms.

Method: Mathematical analysis showing GPTQ's equivalence to Babai's algorithm for the closest vector problem (CVP).

Result: GPTQ's error propagation gains a geometric interpretation and inherits error bounds from Babai's algorithm.

Conclusion: This theoretical grounding opens avenues for improving quantization methods using lattice algorithm advancements.

Abstract: Quantizing the weights of large language models (LLMs) from 16-bit to lower
bitwidth is the de facto approach to deploy massive transformers onto more
affordable accelerators. GPTQ emerged as one of the standard methods for
one-shot post-training quantization at LLM scale. Yet, its inner workings are
described as a sequence of ad-hoc algebraic updates that obscure any geometric
meaning or worst-case guarantees. In this work, we show that, when executed
back-to-front (from the last to first dimension) for a linear layer, GPTQ is
mathematically identical to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for the classical
closest vector problem (CVP) on a lattice defined by the Hessian matrix of the
layer's inputs. This equivalence is based on a sophisticated mathematical
argument, and has two analytical consequences: (i) the GPTQ error propagation
step gains an intuitive geometric interpretation; (ii) GPTQ inherits the error
upper bound of Babai's algorithm under the no-clipping condition. Taken
together, these results place GPTQ on firm theoretical footing and open the
door to importing decades of progress in lattice algorithms towards the design
of future quantization algorithms for billion-parameter models.

Motivation: To understand the connection between Fisher information matrices and NTK in 2-layer ReLU networks, and to analyze their spectral properties.

Result: Concrete forms of eigenfunctions for major eigenvalues of NTK are presented, along with an approximation formula for functions represented by 2-layer neural networks.

Conclusion: The work clarifies the relationship between Fisher information matrices and NTK, offering insights into the spectral structure and function approximation in 2-layer ReLU networks.

Abstract: Fisher information matrices and neural tangent kernels (NTK) for 2-layer ReLU

### [219] [Beyond Internal Data: Constructing Complete Datasets for Fairness Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18561)
*Varsha Ramineni,Hossein A. Rahmani,Emine Yilmaz,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of testing AI fairness without complete demographic data by proposing synthetic data construction from overlapping datasets, validated for accuracy and consistency with real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI in high-risk domains necessitates fairness testing, but legal and privacy concerns limit access to demographic data, making traditional methods impractical.

Method: The authors propose using separate overlapping datasets to create synthetic data with demographic information, ensuring it reflects real-world relationships. This synthetic data is validated against real data.

Result: Fairness metrics derived from synthetic data are consistent with those from real data, demonstrating its reliability for fairness testing.

Conclusion: The synthetic data approach provides a viable solution to data scarcity in fairness testing, enabling independent and model-agnostic evaluations.

Abstract: As AI becomes prevalent in high-risk domains and decision-making, it is
essential to test for potential harms and biases. This urgency is reflected by
the global emergence of AI regulations that emphasise fairness and adequate
testing, with some mandating independent bias audits. However, procuring the
necessary data for fairness testing remains a significant challenge.
Particularly in industry settings, legal and privacy concerns restrict the
collection of demographic data required to assess group disparities, and
auditors face practical and cultural challenges in gaining access to data.
Further, internal historical datasets are often insufficiently representative
to identify real-world biases. This work focuses on evaluating classifier
fairness when complete datasets including demographics are inaccessible. We
propose leveraging separate overlapping datasets to construct complete
synthetic data that includes demographic information and accurately reflects
the underlying relationships between protected attributes and model features.
We validate the fidelity of the synthetic data by comparing it to real data,
and empirically demonstrate that fairness metrics derived from testing on such
synthetic data are consistent with those obtained from real data. This work,
therefore, offers a path to overcome real-world data scarcity for fairness
testing, enabling independent, model-agnostic evaluation of fairness, and
serving as a viable substitute where real data is limited.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an SE(2) invariant transformer for spatial data in autonomous driving, reducing memory usage from quadratic to linear while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial data processing is crucial for autonomous driving tasks, but existing SE(2) invariant methods require quadratic memory, limiting scalability.

Method: Introduces SE(2) invariant scaled dot-product attention, enabling linear memory usage relative to object count.

Result: The approach is practical and outperforms non-invariant architectures in performance.

Conclusion: The SE(2) invariant transformer offers scalable and efficient spatial data processing for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Processing spatial data is a key component in many learning tasks for
autonomous driving such as motion forecasting, multi-agent simulation, and
planning. Prior works have demonstrated the value in using SE(2) invariant
network architectures that consider only the relative poses between objects
(e.g. other agents, scene features such as traffic lanes). However, these
methods compute the relative poses for all pairs of objects explicitly,
requiring quadratic memory. In this work, we propose a mechanism for SE(2)
invariant scaled dot-product attention that requires linear memory relative to
the number of objects in the scene. Our SE(2) invariant transformer
architecture enjoys the same scaling properties that have benefited large
language models in recent years. We demonstrate experimentally that our
approach is practical to implement and improves performance compared to
comparable non-invariant architectures.

TL;DR: A multi-level conditional diffusion model integrates sequence and structure data for efficient protein design, introducing a new evaluation metric, Protein-MMD, to assess quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable protein generation remains a challenge, especially with conditional diffusion models, due to the multi-level nature of protein structures.

Method: Proposes a multi-level conditional diffusion model combining sequence and structure information, and introduces Protein-MMD for evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates efficacy in conditional protein generation tasks on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework and metric improve protein design by capturing hierarchical relations and ensuring functional and distributional similarity.

Abstract: Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of continuous state-action space and physical constraints in human-AI collaboration.

Method: Proposes BASS (Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection) to enhance agent diversity and action outcome understanding.

Result: BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI collaboration tasks.

Conclusion: The Moving Out benchmark and BASS method effectively improve adaptability in physically grounded human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The ability to adapt to physical actions and constraints in an environment is
crucial for embodied agents (e.g., robots) to effectively collaborate with
humans. Such physically grounded human-AI collaboration must account for the
increased complexity of the continuous state-action space and constrained
dynamics caused by physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce
\textit{Moving Out}, a new human-AI collaboration benchmark that resembles a
wide range of collaboration modes affected by physical attributes and
constraints, such as moving heavy items together and maintaining consistent
actions to move a big item around a corner. Using Moving Out, we designed two
tasks and collected human-human interaction data to evaluate models' abilities
to adapt to diverse human behaviors and unseen physical attributes. To address
the challenges in physical environments, we propose a novel method, BASS
(Behavior Augmentation, Simulation, and Selection), to enhance the diversity of
agents and their understanding of the outcome of actions. Our experiments show
that BASS outperforms state-of-the-art models in AI-AI and human-AI
collaboration. The project page is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of quantum circuit synthesis in NISQ and fault-tolerant computing by managing exponential state-space growth.

Method: Uses tabular Q-learning with action sequences in discretized state space, hybrid rewards (static and dynamic penalties), and sparse matrix representations.

Result: Demonstrates minimal-depth circuits for graph-state preparation (up to 7 qubits) and universal gate sets, with optimized gate counts.

Conclusion: The RL approach efficiently explores quantum state space, synthesizing near-optimal circuits, offering a resource-efficient solution for optimization.

Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient
synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states
from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the NISQ era
and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular
Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state
space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension. The
framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static,
domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with
customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures
such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. By leveraging sparse
matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables
scalable navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing
computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to
seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers
minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the
framework to a universal gate set for arbitrary quantum states, it still
produces minimal depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm's robustness and
adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach efficiently
explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum
circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computing for faster decision-making in RL, particularly in partially observable environments modeled as sparse Bayesian networks.

Method: Introduces QBRL, combining quantum rejection sampling and amplitude amplification for belief updates, with rigorous time complexity analysis.

Result: QBRL achieves sub-quadratic speedup for near-optimal planning in sparse Bayesian networks, with performance varying by deployment setting.

Conclusion: QBRL demonstrates quantum advantage in RL, though its impact depends on specific environmental dynamics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for
decision-making in partially observable environments, which can be modeled as
Markov decision processes and compactly represented through dynamic decision
Bayesian networks. Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse
Bayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined
with amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating
acceptance probabilities.\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum
Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead
algorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a
rigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions
for the quantum device. Unlike standard treatments that assume a black-box
oracle, we explicitly specify the inference process, allowing our bounds to
more accurately reflect the true computational cost. We show that, for
environments whose dynamics form a sparse Bayesian network, horizon-based
near-optimal planning can be achieved sub-quadratically faster through
quantum-enhanced belief updates.
  Furthermore, we present numerical experiments benchmarking QBRL against its
classical counterpart on simple yet illustrative decision-making tasks. Our
results offer a detailed analysis of how the quantum computational advantage
translates into decision-making performance, highlighting that the magnitude of
the advantage can vary significantly across different deployment settings.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling,
specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We
propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query
complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output
guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler,
initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in
$\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using
$\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$
membership queries, where
$M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in
$q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using
$\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$
queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between
known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and
R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing
scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and
translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a
logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general
log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring
additional quadratic queries.

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: A survey on Financial Foundation Models (FFMs), categorizing them into FinLFMs, FinTSFMs, and FinVLFMs, reviewing their architectures, training, datasets, applications, and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unique financial domain requirements like multimodal reasoning, regulatory compliance, and data privacy, which general-purpose foundation models (FMs) struggle with.

Method: Presents a taxonomy of FFMs, reviews their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and applications.

Result: Identifies challenges in data availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure, and suggests future research directions.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a reference for FFMs and a roadmap for future innovation, with resources maintained on a dedicated website.

Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) - large-scale pre-trained models with
strong generalization capabilities - has opened new frontiers for financial
engineering. While general-purpose FMs such as GPT-4 and Gemini have
demonstrated promising performance in tasks ranging from financial report
summarization to sentiment-aware forecasting, many financial applications
remain constrained by unique domain requirements such as multimodal reasoning,
regulatory compliance, and data privacy. These challenges have spurred the
emergence of Financial Foundation Models (FFMs) - a new class of models
explicitly designed for finance. This survey presents a comprehensive overview
of FFMs, with a taxonomy spanning three key modalities: Financial Language
Foundation Models (FinLFMs), Financial Time-Series Foundation Models
(FinTSFMs), and Financial Visual-Language Foundation Models (FinVLFMs). We
review their architectures, training methodologies, datasets, and real-world
applications. Furthermore, we identify critical challenges in data
availability, algorithmic scalability, and infrastructure constraints, and
offer insights into future research opportunities. We hope this survey serves
as both a comprehensive reference for understanding FFMs and a practical
roadmap for future innovation. An updated collection of FFM-related
publications and resources will be maintained on our website

*Zihang Li,Hao Xie,Xinyang Dong,Lei Wang*

Main category: cond-mat.str-el

TL;DR: A deep variational free energy framework using three neural networks computes hydrogen's equation of state in warm dense matter, resolving discrepancies in deuterium Hugoniot curve data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address discrepancies in theoretical and experimental results for hydrogen's equation of state in the warm dense matter region.

Method: Uses three deep generative models: a normalizing flow for nuclei, an autoregressive transformer for excited electrons, and a permutational equivariant flow for Hartree-Fock orbitals. Joint optimization minimizes variational free energy.

Result: Provides the equation of state and thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen, benchmarked against deuterium Hugoniot curve data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reliable benchmark for deuterium in warm dense matter, resolving prior inconsistencies.

Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation
of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes
the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite
temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that
represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an
autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited
states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow
coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the
three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the
equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We
compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the
deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The
calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense
matter region.

*Florian List,Yujin Park,Nicholas L. Rodd,Eve Schoen,Florian Wolf*

Main category: astro-ph.HE

TL;DR: The paper investigates the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) using a neural network-aided approach to analyze spatial and spectral data, suggesting it may be diffuse or composed of an exceptionally large number of point sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The GCE's origin is unclear, with debates between dark matter annihilation or dim point sources. Prior analyses lacked spectral data, limiting conclusions.

Method: A neural network-aided simulation-based inference approach is used to analyze both spatial and spectral data of the GCE.

Result: Spectral data suggests the GCE is either diffuse or made of ~10^5 point sources, conflicting with earlier estimates of hundreds.

Conclusion: The GCE is likely diffuse or consists of an unusually large number of point sources, aligning more with dark matter predictions than prior point-source hypotheses.

Abstract: The Galactic Center Excess (GCE) remains one of the defining mysteries
uncovered by the Fermi $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope. Although it may yet herald
the discovery of annihilating dark matter, weighing against that conclusion are
analyses showing the spatial structure of the emission appears more consistent
with a population of dim point sources. Technical limitations have restricted
prior analyses to studying the point-source hypothesis purely spatially. All
spectral information that could help disentangle the GCE from the complex and
uncertain astrophysical emission was discarded. We demonstrate that a neural
network-aided simulation-based inference approach can overcome such limitations
and thereby confront the point source explanation of the GCE with spatial and
spectral data. The addition is profound: energy information drives the putative
point sources to be significantly dimmer, indicating either the GCE is truly
diffuse in nature or made of an exceptionally large number of sources.
Quantitatively, for our best fit background model, the excess is essentially
consistent with Poisson emission as predicted by dark matter. If the excess is
instead due to point sources, our median prediction is ${\cal O}(10^5)$ sources
in the Galactic Center, or more than 35,000 sources at 90% confidence, both
significantly larger than the hundreds of sources preferred by earlier
point-source analyses of the GCE.

TL;DR: The paper proposes caching strategies (FIFO, LRU, Priority-Based) to reduce communication costs in Federated Learning (FL) while maintaining model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication cost is a bottleneck in FL, especially in resource-constrained environments. Reducing unnecessary model updates can improve efficiency.

Method: Introduces caching strategies (FIFO, LRU, Priority-Based) to selectively forward significant updates, lowering bandwidth usage.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: Intelligent caching improves scalability, memory efficiency, and supports reliable FL in edge IoT networks, making it practical for smart cities and healthcare.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple distributed devices to jointly train
a shared model without centralizing data, but communication cost remains a
major bottleneck, especially in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces caching strategies - FIFO, LRU, and Priority-Based - to reduce
unnecessary model update transmissions. By selectively forwarding significant
updates, our approach lowers bandwidth usage while maintaining model accuracy.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets show reduced communication with
minimal accuracy loss. Results confirm that intelligent caching improves

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) showed decentralized LLM pretraining is viable but had issues like local model fitting and unfair rewards. IOTA addresses these by enabling cooperative scaling and fair incentives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome SN9's limitations (isolated miners, unfair rewards) and enable scalable, fair decentralized pretraining.

Method: IOTA introduces data/pipeline-parallel SWARM, granular incentives, activation compression, Butterfly All-Reduce, and CLASP for fair attribution.

Result: Preliminary results show scalable model sizes, improved training speed, linear scalability, and fair contribution measurement.

Conclusion: IOTA successfully addresses SN9's issues, enabling scalable and fair decentralized LLM pretraining.

Abstract: In August 2024, Bittensor's Subnet 9 (SN9) demonstrated that a distributed
network of incentivized, permissionless actors could each pretrain large
language models (LLMs) ranging from 700 million to 14 billion parameters, while
surpassing established baselines. While that work validated blockchain-based
decentralized pretraining as viable, it contained core issues: (i) every miner
had to fit an entire model locally, and (ii) "winner-takes-all" rewards
encouraged model hoarding.
  Here we introduce IOTA (Incentivized Orchestrated Training Architecture), an
architecture that addresses these limitations by transforming SN9's previously
isolated competitors into a single cooperating unit that can scale arbitrarily
while still rewarding each contributor fairly.
  Key preliminary results: (1) Data- and Pipeline-parallel SWARM architecture -
An orchestrator distributes model layers across heterogeneous miners and
streams activations between them, enabling model sizes to scale with the number
of participants rather than being constrained by the VRAM of a single machine;
(2) Granular, continuous incentives - Validators measure each miner's
contribution and allocate token emissions proportionally; (3) Activation
compression - We used model-bottlenecks to cut communication bandwidths of
activations by up to 128x, vastly improving training speed; (4) Butterfly
All-Reduce - Miners average disjoint parameter slices in O(1) bandwidth,
offering linear scalability, redundancy and built-in collusion detection; (5)
CLASP (Contribution Loss Assessment via Sampling of Pathways) - A fair
attribution scheme assigns credit to miners proportional to their marginal
utility and detects exploits, even when contributions are interdependent across
the pipeline.

### [234] [PolyServe: Efficient Multi-SLO Serving at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17769)
*Kan Zhu,Haiyang Shi,Le Xu,Jiaxin Shan,Arvind Krishnamurthy,Baris Kasikci,Liguang Xie*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PolyServe is a novel scheduling policy for LLM-powered applications that efficiently handles diverse latency SLOs, improving throughput and SLO attainment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems inadequately address the nuanced latency requirements within latency-sensitive workloads, leading to suboptimal performance and scheduling.

Method: PolyServe groups requests by latency SLOs, schedules them to subsets of servers, and uses profiling for dynamic scheduling and tail latency control.

Result: PolyServe achieves a 1.23x goodput gain and up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

Conclusion: PolyServe effectively addresses multi-SLO scheduling challenges, enhancing performance and user experience.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a surge of LLM-powered
applications. These applications have diverse token-generation latency
requirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive
(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive
category and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling
opportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO
requirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch
generate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct
SLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for
handling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates
fine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE
scenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO
attainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot
tolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO
scheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing
throughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their
per-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the
server fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still
SLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.
To increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share
tighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses
profiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through
request-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked
prefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing
policies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.

*Zhongzhen Wen,Yinghui Zhang,Zhong Li,Zhongxin Liu,Linna Xie,Tian Zhang*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: MultiKernelBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM-based DL kernel generation, addressing limitations like hardware support and task coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-based DL kernel generation lack hardware diversity, granularity, and balanced task coverage, limiting their utility.

Method: Introduces MultiKernelBench with 285 tasks across 14 kernel categories and 3 hardware platforms, featuring a modular backend and category-aware prompting.

Result: Evaluations show task difficulty variation, poor generalization to less-exposed platforms, and the effectiveness of targeted prompting.

Conclusion: MultiKernelBench provides a robust, extensible benchmark for advancing LLM-based DL kernel generation.

Abstract: The automatic generation of deep learning (DL) kernels using large language
models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the manual effort
and hardware-specific expertise required for writing high-performance operator
implementations. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in this
domain suffer from limited hardware support, coarse-grained kernel
categorization, and imbalanced task coverage. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiKernelBench, the first comprehensive, multi-platform benchmark
for LLM-based DL kernel generation. MultiKernelBench spans 285 tasks across 14
well-defined kernel categories and supports three major hardware platforms:
Nvidia GPUs, Huawei NPUs, and Google TPUs. To enable future extensibility, we
design a modular backend abstraction layer that decouples platform-specific
logic from the core benchmarking infrastructure, allowing easy integration of
new hardware platforms. We further propose a simple yet effective
category-aware one-shot prompting method that improves generation quality by
providing in-category exemplars. Through systematic evaluations of seven
state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal significant variation in task difficulty, poor
generalization to platforms with less training exposure, and the effectiveness
of targeted prompting strategies. MultiKernelBench is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To streamline ADAS and autonomous software development, reduce compliance and re-engineering cycles, and cut development/testing time.

Method: Leverages LLMs for model-based summarization, test scenario generation, and code generation (Python/C++). Uses RAG for scenario generation from regulations. Includes MDE for requirements consistency.

Result: Automated generation of test scenarios, simulation code, and platform-specific code, enhancing efficiency.

Conclusion: The approach reduces development time and improves compliance for ADAS and autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs improves automated code review accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual code review is subjective and time-consuming; automation is needed but LLMs lack logical reasoning for full code understanding.

Method: Proposes integrating symbolic reasoning with LLMs, tested on CodexGlue dataset with models like CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT.

Result: The hybrid approach enhances accuracy and efficiency in automated code review.

Conclusion: Combining symbolic reasoning with LLMs is effective for automating code review.

Abstract: Code review is one of the key processes in the software development lifecycle
and is essential to maintain code quality. However, manual code review is
subjective and time consuming. Given its rule-based nature, code review is well
suited for automation. In recent years, significant efforts have been made to
automate this process with the help of artificial intelligence. Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have also emerged as a promising
tool in this area, but these models often lack the logical reasoning
capabilities needed to fully understand and evaluate code. To overcome this
limitation, this study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates symbolic
reasoning techniques with LLMs to automate the code review process. We tested
our approach using the CodexGlue dataset, comparing several models, including
CodeT5, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT, to assess the effectiveness of combining
symbolic reasoning and prompting techniques with LLMs. Our results show that
this approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of automated code review.

and access laboratory tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system
architecture encompasses agent-specific tool integration, asynchronous
communication patterns, and comprehensive configuration management through
Git-based tracking. Our production deployment strategy utilizes Kubernetes
container orchestration with Helm charts, Docker containerization, and CI/CD
pipelines for automated testing and deployment. The implementation integrates

*Jérôme Emery,Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan,Jean-François Frigon,François Leduc-Primeau*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding reduces energy consumption and adapts to per-user rate requirements, outperforming traditional methods with less complexity and addressing data scarcity via a novel augmentation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based precoding in mMIMO systems requires high-quality local datasets, which are hard to collect, prompting the need for a solution that minimizes energy consumption and adapts dynamically.

Method: Proposes a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO precoding, with a data augmentation method using cosine similarity for adaptation in data-scarce settings.

Result: The model outperforms zero forcing at equal energy consumption and approaches weighted minimum mean squared error performance with 8x less complexity.

Conclusion: The work enables practical DL-based mMIMO solutions by addressing data availability and training complexity, offering greater control over energy efficiency, spectral efficiency, and fairness.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a solution for precoding in massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems due to its capacity to learn the
characteristics of the propagation environment. However, training such a model
requires high-quality, local datasets at the deployment site, which are often
difficult to collect. We propose a transformer-based foundation model for mMIMO
precoding that seeks to minimize the energy consumption of the transmitter
while dynamically adapting to per-user rate requirements. At equal energy
consumption, zero-shot deployment of the proposed foundation model
significantly outperforms zero forcing, and approaches weighted minimum mean
squared error performance with 8x less complexity. To address model adaptation
in data-scarce settings, we introduce a data augmentation method that finds
training samples similar to the target distribution by computing the cosine
similarity between the outputs of the pre-trained feature extractor. Our work
enables the implementation of DL-based solutions in practice by addressing
challenges of data availability and training complexity. Moreover, the ability
to dynamically configure per-user rate requirements can be leveraged by higher
level resource allocation and scheduling algorithms for greater control over
energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and fairness.

*Milad Taghipour,Bane Vasic*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper applies reinforcement learning to improve decoding of linear block codes, proposing methods like MDP mapping, truncated MDP, and action-list decoding. It leverages automorphism groups and feedback to enhance performance, validated on LDPC codes over BSC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of decoding linear block codes by integrating reinforcement learning techniques, reducing complexity, and improving accuracy.

Method: Proposes mapping decoding to MDPs, truncating MDPs via Hamming balls, action-list decoding using Deep-Q networks, leveraging code automorphism, and feedback-based enhancement of existing decoders.

Result: Demonstrates improved decoding performance and reduced complexity, validated experimentally on LDPC codes over BSC.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning effectively enhances decoding performance and reduces complexity, with potential applicability to various code classes.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping
bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the
iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose
different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is
proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball
with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for
reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to
improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list
decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values
that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism
group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose
a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing
high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after
the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of
the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for
the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel
(BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

*Amirarsalan Moatazedian,Yauhen Yakimenka,Rémi A. Chou,Jörg Kliewer*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving data-sharing system is studied, where a privatizer sanitizes data for a reconstructor and two adversaries. The goal is to limit reconstructor distortion while maximizing adversaries' loss, ensuring accurate reconstruction only through collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model scenarios where individual adversaries cannot accurately reconstruct private data, but combined side information allows it, mimicking secret-sharing principles with lossy recovery.

Method: A constrained minimax optimization problem is framed, with a data-driven training procedure updating the privatizer, reconstructor, and adversaries alternately. Special cases (Gaussian and binary) are analyzed for optimal solutions.

Result: Theoretical optimal results for Gaussian and binary cases serve as benchmarks, validating the proposed minimax training approach.

Conclusion: The system effectively balances privacy and utility, ensuring accurate reconstruction only through collaboration, with theoretical benchmarks supporting the method.

Abstract: We study a privacy-preserving data-sharing setting where a privatizer
transforms private data into a sanitized version observed by an authorized
reconstructor and two unauthorized adversaries, each with access to side
information correlated with the private data.
  The reconstructor is evaluated under a distortion function, while each
adversary is evaluated using a separate loss function. The privatizer ensures
the reconstructor distortion remains below a fixed threshold while maximizing
the minimum loss across the two adversaries. This two-adversary setting models
cases where individual users cannot reconstruct the data accurately, but their
combined side information enables estimation within the distortion threshold.
The privatizer maximizes individual loss while permitting accurate
reconstruction only through collaboration. This echoes secret-sharing
principles, but with lossy rather than perfect recovery. We frame this as a
constrained data-driven minimax optimization problem and propose a data-driven
training procedure that alternately updates the privatizer, reconstructor, and
adversaries. We also analyze the Gaussian and binary cases as special scenarios
where optimal solutions can be obtained. These theoretical optimal results are
benchmarks for evaluating the proposed minimax training approach.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the integration of AI/ML in 5G RAN, highlighting challenges like model drift and vendor lock-in. It reviews 3GPP's evolution of AI/ML from experimental to managed functions, focusing on a standardized LCM framework, and identifies open challenges for 6G.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of AI/ML in 5G RAN faces challenges like model drift and lack of transparency, necessitating a standardized LCM framework for large-scale deployment.

Method: The paper reviews 3GPP's progression from Releases 16-20, introducing standardized interfaces for AI/ML model transfer, execution, and monitoring, culminating in a vendor-agnostic LCM profile.

Result: A five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven monitoring, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes are developed, addressing key challenges in AI/ML deployment for 5G RAN.

Conclusion: The advancements lay the groundwork for AI-native transceivers in 6G, though challenges remain in monitoring, drift detection, and model training.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are rapidly
permeating the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), powering beam management, channel
state information (CSI) feedback, positioning, and mobility prediction.
However, without a standardized life-cycle management (LCM) framework,
challenges, such as model drift, vendor lock-in, and limited transparency,
hinder large-scale adoption. 3GPP Releases 16-20 progressively evolve AI/ML
from experimental features to managed, interoperable network functions.
Beginning with the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) in Rel-16,
subsequent releases introduced standardized interfaces for model transfer,
execution, performance monitoring, and closed-loop control, culminating in
Rel-20's two-sided CSI-compression Work Item and vendor-agnostic LCM profile.
This article reviews the resulting five-block LCM architecture, KPI-driven
monitoring mechanisms, and inter-vendor collaboration schemes, while
identifying open challenges in resource-efficient monitoring, environment drift
detection, intelligent decision-making, and flexible model training. These
developments lay the foundation for AI-native transceivers as a key enabler for
6G.

Method: The study introduces PathoROB, a benchmark with three metrics, and evaluates 20 FMs across four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 centers.

Result: All evaluated FMs showed robustness deficits, leading to diagnostic errors. Robust FMs and post-hoc methods reduced but did not eliminate risks.

Conclusion: Robustness evaluation is critical for clinical FM adoption. Future FM development must prioritize robustness, with PathoROB serving as a blueprint for biomedical domains.

Abstract: Biomedical Foundation Models (FMs) are rapidly transforming AI-enabled
healthcare research and entering clinical validation. However, their
susceptibility to learning non-biological technical features -- including
variations in surgical/endoscopic techniques, laboratory procedures, and
scanner hardware -- poses risks for clinical deployment. We present the first
systematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.
Our work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates
the consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM
robustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,
a robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness
index, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical
centers. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated
FMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that
non-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and
clinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs
and post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)
the risk of such errors. This work establishes that robustness evaluation is
essential for validating pathology FMs before clinical adoption and
demonstrates that future FM development must integrate robustness as a core
design principle. PathoROB provides a blueprint for assessing robustness across
biomedical domains, guiding FM improvement efforts towards more robust,
representative, and clinically deployable AI systems that prioritize biological
information over technical artifacts.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes TenVOO, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for 3D U-Net-based DDPMs in MRI image generation, achieving high performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of research on parameter-efficient representations for 3D convolution operations in MRI image generation.

Method: Introduces TenVOO, leveraging tensor network modeling to represent 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional tensors.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in MS-SSIM on brain MRI datasets (ADNI, PPMI, BraTS2021) with only 0.3% of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: TenVOO is an effective PEFT method for 3D DDPMs, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: We address the challenge of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for
three-dimensional (3D) U-Net-based denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image generation. Despite its
practical significance, research on parameter-efficient representations of 3D
convolution operations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Tensor
Volumetric Operator (TenVOO), a novel PEFT method specifically designed for
fine-tuning DDPMs with 3D convolutional backbones. Leveraging tensor network
modeling, TenVOO represents 3D convolution kernels with lower-dimensional
tensors, effectively capturing complex spatial dependencies during fine-tuning
with few parameters. We evaluate TenVOO on three downstream brain MRI
datasets-ADNI, PPMI, and BraTS2021-by fine-tuning a DDPM pretrained on 59,830
T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the UK Biobank. Our results demonstrate that
TenVOO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scale structural
similarity index measure (MS-SSIM), outperforming existing approaches in
capturing spatial dependencies while requiring only 0.3% of the trainable
parameters of the original model. Our code is available at:

score, which indicates that our model's reliability and consistency across
various input scenarios. Our method also secured first place in the challenge.

TL;DR: A deep learning approach for glioblastoma diagnosis using a pre-trained model, achieving modest performance metrics and second place in the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the diagnostic challenges of glioblastoma's heterogeneity to improve treatment selection and patient outcomes.

Method: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the BraTS-Path training dataset.

Result: Modest accuracy, recall, and F1-score (0.392229), high specificity (0.898704), and second place in testing.

Conclusion: The model shows potential but requires improvement for better diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Glioblastoma, a highly aggressive brain tumor with diverse molecular and
pathological features, poses a diagnostic challenge due to its heterogeneity.
Accurate diagnosis and assessment of this heterogeneity are essential for
choosing the right treatment and improving patient outcomes. Traditional
methods rely on identifying specific features in tissue samples, but deep
learning offers a promising approach for improved glioblastoma diagnosis. In
this paper, we present our approach to the BraTS-Path Challenge 2024. We
leverage a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on the BraTS-Path training
dataset. Our model demonstrates poor performance on the challenging BraTS-Path
validation set, as rigorously assessed by the Synapse online platform. The
model achieves an accuracy of 0.392229, a recall of 0.392229, and a F1-score of
0.392229, indicating a consistent ability to correctly identify instances under
the target condition. Notably, our model exhibits perfect specificity of
0.898704, showing an exceptional capacity to correctly classify negative cases.
Moreover, a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.255267 is calculated,
to signify a limited positive correlation between predicted and actual values
and highlight our model's overall predictive power. Our solution also achieves
the second place during the testing phase.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study uses hyperspectral imaging and ML models to predict nitrogen (N) concentration in grapevine leaves and canopies, identifying key spectral regions for accurate N estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nitrogen is vital for vineyards, but its variability in soil makes precise estimation and management at the plant level necessary for optimal growth and product quality.

Method: Hyperspectral images (400-1000nm) of four grapevine cultivars were analyzed. Feature selection identified key spectral bands, and ML models (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) were trained for N prediction.

Result: Key spectral regions (500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, 900-950nm) were robust for N prediction. ML models achieved R² of 0.49 (canopy) and 0.57 (leaf).

Conclusion: Hyperspectral imaging combined with feature selection and ML techniques is effective for monitoring N status in vineyards.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting
plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has
high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate
the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the
individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used
in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of
four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over
two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N
concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two
feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral
bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral
bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,
Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The
comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets
showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection
methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level
datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,
and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral
regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction
demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level
data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets
of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the
potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data
in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in
vineyards.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model for multislice electron ptychography, enhances 3D atomic structure reconstruction by integrating with iterative solvers, improving SSIM by 90.50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative algorithms for MEP are slow and produce suboptimal results due to ill-posed nature.

Method: Developed MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion model trained on crystal structures, integrated via Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) with iterative solvers.

Result: Achieved a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over existing methods.

Conclusion: Hybrid approach of MEP-Diffusion with iterative solvers significantly enhances reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Multislice electron ptychography (MEP) is an inverse imaging technique that
computationally reconstructs the highest-resolution images of atomic crystal
structures from diffraction patterns. Available algorithms often solve this
inverse problem iteratively but are both time consuming and produce suboptimal
solutions due to their ill-posed nature. We develop MEP-Diffusion, a diffusion
model trained on a large database of crystal structures specifically for MEP to
augment existing iterative solvers. MEP-Diffusion is easily integrated as a
generative prior into existing reconstruction methods via Diffusion Posterior
Sampling (DPS). We find that this hybrid approach greatly enhances the quality
of the reconstructed 3D volumes, achieving a 90.50% improvement in SSIM over
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized, large-scale datasets for TCM tongue diagnosis hinders AI development and clinical integration.

Method: The dataset includes 6,719 high-quality images annotated with 20 pathological symptoms, verified by TCM practitioners, and supports multiple annotation formats. Nine deep learning models were benchmarked.

Result: The dataset provides a foundation for reliable computational tools in TCM, demonstrating utility for AI development.

Conclusion: This resource bridges the data gap, facilitating AI integration into TCM research and clinical practice with standardized diagnostic data.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) tongue diagnosis, while clinically
valuable, faces standardization challenges due to subjective interpretation and
inconsistent imaging protocols, compounded by the lack of large-scale,
annotated datasets for AI development. To address this gap, we present the
first specialized dataset for AI-driven TCM tongue diagnosis, comprising 6,719
high-quality images captured under standardized conditions and annotated with
20 pathological symptom categories (averaging 2.54 clinically validated labels
per image, all verified by licensed TCM practitioners). The dataset supports
multiple annotation formats (COCO, TXT, XML) for broad usability and has been
benchmarked using nine deep learning models (YOLOv5/v7/v8 variants, SSD, and
MobileNetV2) to demonstrate its utility for AI development. This resource
provides a critical foundation for advancing reliable computational tools in
TCM, bridging the data shortage that has hindered progress in the field, and
facilitating the integration of AI into both research and clinical practice
through standardized, high-quality diagnostic data.

### [250] [Hierarchical Diffusion Framework for Pseudo-Healthy Brain MRI Inpainting with Enhanced 3D Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17911)
*Dou Hoon Kwark,Shirui Luo,Xiyue Zhu,Yudu Li,Zhi-Pei Liang,Volodymyr Kindratenko*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hierarchical diffusion framework for pseudo-healthy MRI inpainting combines axial and coronal 2D models to balance data efficiency and volumetric consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D inpainting methods for brain MRI scans suffer from slice discontinuities, while 3D models require extensive training data, which is often impractical in medical settings.

Method: The proposed method uses two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D diffusion stages: an axial model for global consistency and a coronal model for refining anatomical details, with adaptive resampling.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in realism and volumetric consistency.

Conclusion: The hierarchical diffusion framework is a promising solution for pseudo-healthy MRI inpainting, offering a balance between data efficiency and volumetric fidelity.

Abstract: Pseudo-healthy image inpainting is an essential preprocessing step for
analyzing pathological brain MRI scans. Most current inpainting methods favor
slice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence
across slices produces discontinuities in the volume. Fully 3D models alleviate
this issue, but their high model capacity demands extensive training data for
reliable, high-fidelity synthesis -- often impractical in medical settings. We
address these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing
direct 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial
diffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a
coronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining
perpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data
efficiency and volumetric consistency. Our experiments show our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both realism and volumetric
consistency, making it a promising solution for pseudo-healthy image
inpainting. Code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A benchmarking study evaluates three MRI abdominal segmentation models and introduces ABDSynth, a CT-trained alternative, highlighting MRSegmentator as the top performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI segmentation is challenging due to signal variability and annotation effort, limiting generalizability of existing tools.

Method: Benchmarked three state-of-the-art models (MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, TotalSegmentator MRI) and introduced ABDSynth, trained on CT data. Evaluated on diverse public datasets.

Result: MRSegmentator performed best; ABDSynth, though less accurate, offers a viable option with limited annotation resources.

Conclusion: MRSegmentator is the most generalizable, while ABDSynth provides a practical alternative for low-annotation scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to robust automated tools for
segmentation of abdominal computed tomography (CT). Meanwhile, segmentation of
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is substantially more challenging due to the
inherent signal variability and the increased effort required for annotating
training datasets. Hence, existing approaches are trained on limited sets of
MRI sequences, which might limit their generalizability. To characterize the
landscape of MRI abdominal segmentation tools, we present here a comprehensive
benchmarking of the three state-of-the-art and open-source models:
MRSegmentator, MRISegmentator-Abdomen, and TotalSegmentator MRI. Since these
models are trained using labor-intensive manual annotation cycles, we also
introduce and evaluate ABDSynth, a SynthSeg-based model purely trained on
widely available CT segmentations (no real images). More generally, we assess
accuracy and generalizability by leveraging three public datasets (not seen by
any of the evaluated methods during their training), which span all major
manufacturers, five MRI sequences, as well as a variety of subject conditions,
voxel resolutions, and fields-of-view. Our results reveal that MRSegmentator
achieves the best performance and is most generalizable. In contrast, ABDSynth
yields slightly less accurate results, but its relaxed requirements in training
data make it an alternative when the annotation budget is limited. The
evaluation code and datasets are given for future benchmarking at
https://github.com/deepakri201/AbdoBench, along with inference code and weights

*Hang Xu,Alexandre Bousse,Alessandro Perelli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning method (DEcomp-MoD) for material decomposition in DECT directly processes projection data, outperforming existing methods by integrating spectral DECT knowledge and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DECT material decomposition methods are sub-optimal due to post-reconstruction processing and beam-hardening effects.

Method: DEcomp-MoD combines spectral DECT model knowledge with a score-based denoising diffusion prior, directly converting sinograms to material images.

Result: DEcomp-MoD outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised methods on synthetic DECT data.

Conclusion: DEcomp-MoD shows promise for clinical DECT diagnosis by improving material decomposition accuracy.

Abstract: Dual-energy X-ray Computed Tomography (DECT) constitutes an advanced
technology which enables automatic decomposition of materials in clinical
images without manual segmentation using the dependency of the X-ray linear
attenuation with energy. However, most methods perform material decomposition
in the image domain as a post-processing step after reconstruction but this
procedure does not account for the beam-hardening effect and it results in
sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called
Dual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative
material decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into
material images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the
spectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a
score-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.
Importantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the
sinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional
diffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the
performance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed
DEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.
Finally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised
score-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to
be deployed for clinical diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UniSegDiff improves lesion segmentation by addressing uneven attention in diffusion models with staged training and inference, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models suffer from uneven attention across timesteps, leading to longer training and suboptimal results for lesion segmentation.

Method: Proposes UniSegDiff, a framework with staged training and inference, dynamically adjusting prediction targets and pre-training feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in lesion segmentation across six organs and multiple imaging modalities.

Conclusion: UniSegDiff effectively unifies lesion segmentation, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: The Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) has demonstrated remarkable
performance across a variety of generative tasks. The inherent randomness in
diffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical
images and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a
promising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current
training and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven
distribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer
training times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a
novel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a
unified manner across multiple modalities and organs. This framework introduces
a staged training and inference approach, dynamically adjusting the prediction
targets at different stages, forcing the model to maintain high attention
across all timesteps, and achieves unified lesion segmentation through
pre-training the feature extraction network for segmentation. We evaluate
performance on six different organs across various imaging modalities.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that UniSegDiff significantly
outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. The code is available

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology by introducing a high-quality dataset and a prompt argumentation strategy, improving diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal models for gastrointestinal pathology suffer from data noise, incomplete annotations, and lack of reasoning transparency, leading to unreliable outputs in clinical settings.

Method: The authors construct a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations and propose a prompt argumentation strategy. They also use supervised fine-tuning and GRPO for post-training.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4% improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors.

Conclusion: The proposed solution enhances diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility, making it more reliable for pathology report generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large models have shown great potential in automating pathology
image analysis. However, current multimodal models for gastrointestinal
pathology are constrained by both data quality and reasoning transparency:
pervasive noise and incomplete annotations in public datasets predispose vision
language models to factual hallucinations when generating diagnostic text,
while the absence of explicit intermediate reasoning chains renders the outputs
difficult to audit and thus less trustworthy in clinical practice. To address
these issues, we construct a large scale gastrointestinal pathology dataset
containing both microscopic descriptions and diagnostic conclusions, and
propose a prompt argumentation strategy that incorporates lesion classification
and anatomical site information. This design guides the model to better capture
image specific features and maintain semantic consistency in generation.
Furthermore, we employ a post training pipeline that combines supervised fine
tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve reasoning
quality and output structure. Experimental results on real world pathology
report generation tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state of the art open source and proprietary baselines in terms of generation
quality, structural completeness, and clinical relevance. Our solution
outperforms state of the art models with 18.7% higher clinical relevance, 32.4%
improved structural completeness, and 41.2% fewer diagnostic errors,
demonstrating superior accuracy and clinical utility compared to existing
solutions.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the definability issue of Rumsfeld ignorance by assuming distinct accessibility relations, retaining previous validities, and providing axiomatizations over bi-frame classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the trivialization of results and axiomatization problems caused by the definability of Rumsfeld ignorance in terms of ignorance, due to identical accessibility relations.

Method: Assume two distinct accessibility relations (one a subset of the other) to avoid definability issues, then axiomatize over proper bi-frame classes.

Result: Axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame classes are achieved, and the framework is applied to analyze Fine's results.

Conclusion: Distinct accessibility relations resolve the definability problem while preserving most validities, enabling meaningful axiomatization and analysis of ignorance-related logical properties.

Abstract: In a recent paper, Kit Fine presents some striking results concerning the
logical properties of (first-order) ignorance, second-order ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance. However, Rumsfeld ignorance is definable in terms of
ignorance, which makes some existing results and the axiomatization problem
trivial. A main reason is that the accessibility relations for the implicit
knowledge operator contained in the packaged operators of ignorance and
Rumsfeld ignorance are the same. In this work, we assume the two accessibility
relations to be different so that one of them is an arbitrary subset of the
other. This will avoid the definability issue and retain most of the previous
validities. The main results are axiomatizations over various proper bi-frame
classes. Finally we apply our framework to analyze Fine's results.

*Zeqiang Zhang,Ruxin Chen*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: RL in economic modeling shows a conflict between equilibrium theory and agent behavior. A calibrated Mean-Field RL framework resolves this, aligning agent policies with competitive equilibrium.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between RL agent behavior and economic equilibrium assumptions, ensuring theoretically sound modeling.

Method: Proposes a calibrated Mean-Field RL framework with iterative algorithm to align agent policies with competitive equilibrium.

Result: The framework converges to a self-consistent fixed point where agent behavior matches equilibrium theory.

Conclusion: Provides a tractable and theoretically sound method for modeling learning agents in economic systems.

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

TL;DR: Four unresolved graph theory conjectures generated by an AI system, TxGraffiti, are presented. They are empirically validated but defy proof or counterexample, inviting human and AI collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To showcase how AI can contribute to mathematical creativity by generating conjectures that challenge and inspire human mathematicians and AI systems alike.

Method: The conjectures were generated by the automated system TxGraffiti, using symbolic pattern recognition and mathematician-defined heuristics, and refined through human dialogue.

Result: Four concise, empirically validated conjectures in graph theory that remain unresolved despite extensive effort.

Conclusion: The conjectures serve as collaborative artifacts, inspiring reflection on AI's role in mathematical discovery and encouraging engagement from both humans and machines.

Abstract: We present four open conjectures in graph theory generated by the automated
conjecturing system \texttt{TxGraffiti}. Each conjecture is concise, grounded
in natural graph invariants, and empirically validated across hundreds of
graphs. Despite extensive effort, these statements remain unresolved--defying
both proof and counterexample. They are not only mathematical challenges but
creative expressions--born of symbolic pattern recognition and
mathematician-defined heuristics, refined through years of human dialogue, and
now offered back to the community as collaborative artifacts. These conjectures
invite not only formal proof, but also reflection on how machines can evoke
wonder, spark curiosity, and contribute to the raw material of discovery. By
highlighting these problems, we aim to inspire both human mathematicians and AI
systems to engage with them--not only to solve them, but to reflect on what it
means when machines participate meaningfully in the creative process of
mathematical thought.

### [259] [Machine Learning Workflow for Analysis of High-Dimensional Order Parameter Space: A Case Study of Polymer Crystallization from Molecular Dynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17980)
*Elyar Tourani,Brian J. Edwards,Bamin Khomami*

Main category: physics.comp-ph

TL;DR: A machine learning workflow is introduced to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymers using atomistic data, reducing reliance on biased single-order parameters and achieving high classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for identifying crystallization pathways in polymers rely on preset cut-off points on single order parameters, which introduce biases and sensitivity issues.

Method: An integrated machine learning workflow combines high-dimensional feature vectors, low-dimensional embeddings, and unsupervised clustering to label crystalline and amorphous atoms. Supervised learning then identifies a minimal set of order parameters.

Result: The workflow achieves over 0.98 AUC classification performance, defining a crystallinity index (C-index) that remains bimodal. It efficiently computes crystallinity on-the-fly and reveals entropy and symmetry's roles in crystallization.

Conclusion: The study provides a data-driven approach for order parameter selection and monitoring structural transformations in polymer simulations, highlighting the dominance of entropy early and symmetry later in crystallization.

Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being
carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on
a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions.
Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own
systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is
presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using
atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a
high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,
and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to
expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,
unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous
atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with
multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a
minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various
tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only
three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.
Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as
the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal
throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance
(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient
on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal
C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the
hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains
relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection
and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer
simulations.

### [261] [Approximate SMT Counting Beyond Discrete Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18612)
*Arijit Shaw,Kuldeep S. Meel*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: pact is a hybrid SMT model counter using hashing-based approximate counting, outperforming baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend SMT solvers to model counting for hybrid formulas, addressing limitations of existing discrete-only methods.

Method: Uses hashing-based approximate model counting with optimized hash functions, requiring logarithmic SMT solver calls.

Result: pact finished 603 out of 14,202 instances, vastly outperforming the baseline's 13.

Conclusion: pact is an effective solution for hybrid SMT model counting with theoretical guarantees and practical performance gains.

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers have advanced automated reasoning,
solving complex formulas across discrete and continuous domains. Recent
progress in propositional model counting motivates extending SMT capabilities
toward model counting, especially for hybrid SMT formulas. Existing approaches,
like bit-blasting, are limited to discrete variables, highlighting the
challenge of counting solutions projected onto the discrete domain in hybrid
formulas.
  We introduce pact, an SMT model counter for hybrid formulas that uses
hashing-based approximate model counting to estimate solutions with theoretical
guarantees. pact makes a logarithmic number of SMT solver calls relative to the
projection variables, leveraging optimized hash functions. pact achieves
significant performance improvements over baselines on a large suite of
benchmarks. In particular, out of 14,202 instances, pact successfully finished
on 603 instances, while Baseline could only finish on 13 instances.

### [262] [A Supervised Machine Learning Framework for Multipactor Breakdown Prediction in High-Power Radio Frequency Devices and Accelerator Components: A Case Study in Planar Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17881)
*Asif Iqbal,John Verboncoeur,Peng Zhang*

Main category: physics.acc-ph

TL;DR: The paper applies supervised machine learning (ML) to predict multipactor susceptibility in RF devices, using tree-based models and MLPs, highlighting their performance and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility is critical for RF device and accelerator system design but is computationally intensive.

Method: Supervised ML models (Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, MLPs) trained on simulation-derived data to predict electron growth rate, evaluated using IoU, SSIM, and Pearson correlation.

Result: Tree-based models outperform MLPs; MLPs with combined objective functions perform better. PCA reveals feature-space limitations.

Conclusion: ML shows promise for multipactor prediction but requires broader dataset coverage for improved generalization.

Abstract: Multipactor is a nonlinear electron avalanche phenomenon that can severely
impair the performance of high-power radio frequency (RF) devices and
accelerator systems. Accurate prediction of multipactor susceptibility across
different materials and operational regimes remains a critical yet
computationally intensive challenge in accelerator component design and RF
engineering. This study presents the first application of supervised machine
learning (ML) for predicting multipactor susceptibility in two-surface planar
geometries. A simulation-derived dataset spanning six distinct secondary
electron yield (SEY) material profiles is used to train regression models -
including Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost), and funnel-structured Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) - to predict the
time-averaged electron growth rate, ${\delta}_{avg}$. Performance is evaluated
using Intersection over Union (IoU), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and
Pearson correlation coefficient. Tree-based models consistently outperform MLPs
in generalizing across disjoint material domains. MLPs trained using a
scalarized objective function that combines IoU and SSIM during Bayesian
hyperparameter optimization with 5-fold cross-validation outperform those
trained with single-objective loss functions. Principal Component Analysis
reveals that performance degradation for certain materials stems from disjoint
feature-space distributions, underscoring the need for broader dataset
coverage. This study demonstrates both the promise and limitations of ML-based
multipactor prediction and lays the groundwork for accelerated, data-driven
modeling in advanced RF and accelerator system design.

*Mingfeng Yuan,Letian Wang,Steven L. Waslander*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to bridge the gap between language instructions and robot navigation, enabling open-set tasks by generating trajectory points and integrating semantic and spatial data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of translating complex language instructions into actionable robot navigation in open-world settings, beyond predefined motion primitives.

Method: Leverages MLLMs for cross-modal understanding and code-generation to create 2D bird-eye-view value maps, combining semantic knowledge with spatial data. Validated using autonomous vehicle datasets and a Husky robot.

Result: Demonstrates robust execution of diverse natural language navigation instructions, handling object detection errors and linguistic ambiguities in both indoor and outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates MLLMs with perception models for open-world navigation, proving real-world applicability and robustness.

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at

*Arup Kumar Sahoo,Itzik Klein*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoRPI-PINN is a physics-informed neural network for accurate inertial-based robot navigation, improving accuracy by 85% over other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate navigation without satellite or cameras is crucial for mobile robots, but inertial sensors alone suffer from drift due to noise.

Method: Uses a physics-informed neural network (MoRPI-PINN) embedding physical laws to mitigate drift and improve navigation.

Result: Achieves over 85% accuracy improvement in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: MoRPI-PINN is lightweight, robust, and suitable for edge devices in mobile robot applications.

Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy in mobile robots is accurate
navigation even in situations where satellite navigation or cameras are
unavailable. In such practical situations, relying only on inertial sensors
will result in navigation solution drift due to the sensors' inherent noise and
error terms. One of the emerging solutions to mitigate drift is to maneuver the
robot in a snake-like slithering motion to increase the inertial
signal-to-noise ratio, allowing the regression of the mobile robot position. In
this work, we propose MoRPI-PINN as a physics-informed neural network framework
for accurate inertial-based mobile robot navigation. By embedding physical laws
and constraints into the training process, MoRPI-PINN is capable of providing
an accurate and robust navigation solution. Using real-world experiments, we
show accuracy improvements of over 85% compared to other approaches. MoRPI-PINN
is a lightweight approach that can be implemented even on edge devices and used
in any typical mobile robot application.

*Chenyu Su,Weiwei Shang,Chen Qian,Fei Zhang,Shuang Cong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReSem3D leverages MLLMs and VFMs to create fine-grained 3D spatial constraints for real-time robotic manipulation, addressing limitations like coarse semantics and lack of closed-loop planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for robotic manipulation suffer from coarse semantic granularity, no real-time planning, and robustness issues in diverse environments.

Method: ReSem3D uses hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs and VFMs to construct 3D spatial constraints in two stages: part-level extraction and region-level refinement, encoded as real-time optimization objectives.

Result: The framework successfully performs diverse manipulation tasks in zero-shot conditions, showing adaptability and generalization in household and lab environments.

Conclusion: ReSem3D advances robotic manipulation by unifying semantic understanding and execution, demonstrating robustness and real-time performance in diverse settings.

Abstract: Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.

*Ines Frajtag,Marko Švaco,Filip Šuligoj*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the MediaPipe algorithm for facial landmark detection in medical settings, showing improved accuracy under surgical lighting and at larger angles, despite some dispersion issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like variable lighting and flexible detection positions in medical applications of face detection algorithms.

Method: Testing the MediaPipe algorithm in a controlled setting with a robotic arm adjusting positions while surgical light and phantom remain fixed.

Result: Improved accuracy in facial landmark detection under surgical lighting, especially at larger yaw and pitch angles, though with some dispersion.

Conclusion: The study suggests potential for integrating the MediaPipe algorithm into medical procedures, despite minor detection precision issues.

Abstract: The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming
increasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face
detection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,
and plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable
lighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and
precisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe
algorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a
robotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and
the phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate
that the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting
significantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch
angles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise
detection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion
on the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical
procedures.

*Xiaojie Zhang,Yuanfei Wang,Ruihai Wu,Kunqi Xu,Yu Li,Liuyu Xiang,Hao Dong,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaRPG is a framework using foundation models to improve manipulation of articulated objects by focusing on part-level affordances and leveraging common knowledge for adaptive control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in manipulating articulated objects due to geometric diversity and functional variations, which hinder generalization.

Method: Proposes AdaRPG, which extracts object parts for better affordance generalization and uses foundation models to reason about mechanisms and generate control codes.

Result: Demonstrates strong generalization across novel articulated object categories in simulations and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: AdaRPG effectively enhances adaptive manipulation of articulated objects by leveraging part-level affordances and foundation models.

Abstract: Articulated objects pose diverse manipulation challenges for robots. Since
their internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively
explore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.
While existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive
articulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the
geometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual
perception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and
mechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that
leverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater
local geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual
affordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we
construct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance
model. Additionally, AdaRPG utilizes the common knowledge embedded in
foundation models to reason about complex mechanisms and generate high-level
control codes that invoke primitive skill functions based on part affordance
inference. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate AdaRPG's strong
generalization ability across novel articulated object categories.

*Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shusen Liu,Christine Klymko,Shashank Kushwaha,Derek Shi,Wesam Sakla,Sainyam Galhotra,Ruben Glatt*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VERIRAG introduces a framework to evaluate scientific quality in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, improving evidence vetting with a checklist, quality score, and dynamic threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems treat all retrieved evidence equally, ignoring scientific rigor, which can mislead clinical decisions.

Method: VERIRAG uses an 11-point checklist (Veritable), a Hard-to-Vary (HV) Score, and a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold to assess and weight evidence quality.

Result: VERIRAG outperforms baselines, achieving F1 scores of 0.53-0.65, a 10-14 point improvement.

Conclusion: VERIRAG enhances RAG systems by rigorously vetting evidence, improving reliability in clinical decision support.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are increasingly adopted in
clinical decision support, yet they remain methodologically blind-they retrieve
evidence but cannot vet its scientific quality. A paper claiming "Antioxidant
proteins decreased after alloferon treatment" and a rigorous multi-laboratory
replication study will be treated as equally credible, even if the former
lacked scientific rigor or was even retracted. To address this challenge, we
introduce VERIRAG, a framework that makes three notable contributions: (i) the
Veritable, an 11-point checklist that evaluates each source for methodological
rigor, including data integrity and statistical validity; (ii) a Hard-to-Vary
(HV) Score, a quantitative aggregator that weights evidence by its quality and
diversity; and (iii) a Dynamic Acceptance Threshold, which calibrates the
required evidence based on how extraordinary a claim is. Across four
datasets-comprising retracted, conflicting, comprehensive, and settled science
corpora-the VERIRAG approach consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving
absolute F1 scores ranging from 0.53 to 0.65, representing a 10 to 14 point
improvement over the next-best method in each respective dataset. We will
release all materials necessary for reproducing our results.

*Damith Premasiri,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes using LLM-based text embedders for Prior Case Retrieval (PCR) to overcome challenges like lengthy legal texts and lack of training data, outperforming traditional methods like BM25 and supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient retrieval of prior legal cases due to the growing volume of cases, and the limitations of traditional IR methods and deep learning models in PCR.

Method: Leveraging LLM-based text embedders in an unsupervised manner to handle lengthy legal texts and avoid the need for large training datasets.

Result: LLM-based embedders outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models in four PCR benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-based embedders are a promising solution for PCR, addressing key challenges and improving retrieval performance.

Abstract: In common law systems, legal professionals such as lawyers and judges rely on
precedents to build their arguments. As the volume of cases has grown massively
over time, effectively retrieving prior cases has become essential. Prior case
retrieval (PCR) is an information retrieval (IR) task that aims to
automatically identify the most relevant court cases for a specific query from
a large pool of potential candidates. While IR methods have seen several
paradigm shifts over the last few years, the vast majority of PCR methods
continue to rely on traditional IR methods, such as BM25. The state-of-the-art
deep learning IR methods have not been successful in PCR due to two key
challenges: i. Lengthy legal text limitation; when using the powerful
BERT-based transformer models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which
inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss
of legal context information. ii. Lack of legal training data; due to data
privacy concerns, available PCR datasets are often limited in size, making it
difficult to train deep learning-based models effectively. In this research, we
address these challenges by leveraging LLM-based text embedders in PCR.
LLM-based embedders support longer input lengths, and since we use them in an
unsupervised manner, they do not require training data, addressing both
challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLM-based text embedders in four PCR benchmark datasets and show that they
outperform BM25 and supervised transformer-based models.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces DR.EHR, a dense retrieval model for EHRs, addressing semantic gaps with a two-stage training pipeline and outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR retrieval is challenging due to semantic gaps, and existing models lack sufficient medical knowledge or suitable training data.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) medical entity extraction and knowledge injection, (2) training data generation using large language models. Two model variants (110M and 7B parameters) are trained.

Result: DR.EHR achieves state-of-the-art results on the CliniQ benchmark, excelling in semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.

Conclusion: DR.EHR advances EHR retrieval with robust performance and generalizability, offering a practical solution for clinical use.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their
retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent
advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models,
both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient
medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces
\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for
EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV
discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and
large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction
and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second
stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train
two variants of \texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively.
Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all
existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed
analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types,
particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation.
Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and
supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models'
generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with
multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a
robust solution for clinical applications.

*Maria Vlachou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fashion-AlterEval, a dataset with human judgments for alternative items in fashion CRS, and proposes meta-user simulators to improve evaluation by considering alternatives and user patience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing user simulators in CRS focus on a single target item and lack realism due to unlimited patience, limiting offline evaluation.

Method: The authors create Fashion-AlterEval by annotating fashion CRS datasets and develop two meta-user simulators that incorporate alternative item preferences and dynamic patience.

Result: Experiments show that considering alternatives improves CRS evaluation, revealing that single-target evaluation underestimates system effectiveness and faster user satisfaction is possible.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and simulators enhance CRS evaluation by addressing limitations of single-target focus and static patience, leading to more realistic assessments.

Abstract: In Conversational Recommendation Systems (CRS), a user provides feedback on
recommended items at each turn, leading the CRS towards improved
recommendations. Due to the need for a large amount of data, a user simulator
is employed for both training and evaluation. Such user simulators critique the
current retrieved item based on knowledge of a single target item. However,
system evaluation in offline settings with simulators is limited by the focus
on a single target item and their unlimited patience over a large number of
turns. To overcome these limitations of existing simulators, we propose
Fashion-AlterEval, a new dataset that contains human judgments for a selection
of alternative items by adding new annotations in common fashion CRS datasets.
Consequently, we propose two novel meta-user simulators that use the collected
judgments and allow simulated users not only to express their preferences about
alternative items to their original target, but also to change their mind and
level of patience. In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the
original datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of
alternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation
of existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation
underestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to
instead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to
more quickly satisfy the user.

*Arindam Ghosh,Mark Fuhs,Bongjun Kim,Anurag Chowdhury,Monika Woszczyna*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper extends the joint ASR + speaker diarization framework to speaker-role diarization (RD), simplifying training, using task-specific predictors, and leveraging RD to improve ASR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speaker-role diarization (RD) is more practical than traditional speaker diarization (SD) for applications like medical or talk shows, where roles (e.g., doctor-patient) matter more than generic speaker labels.

Method: The authors simplify training with forced alignment and cross-entropy loss, use separate predictors for word and role tasks, and integrate RD posterior activity into ASR decoding.

Result: The approach improves role diarization accuracy and reduces small-word deletion errors in ASR.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively extends joint ASR + SD to RD, enhancing both role prediction and ASR performance.

Abstract: From an application standpoint, speaker-role diarization (RD), such as doctor
vs. patient, host vs. guest, etc. is often more useful than traditional speaker
diarization (SD), which assigns generic labels like speaker-1, speaker-2 etc.
In the context of joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) + SD (who spoke
what?), recent end-to-end models employ an auxiliary SD transducer,
synchronized with the ASR transducer, to predict speakers per word. In this
paper, we extend this framework to RD with three key contributions: (1) we
simplify the training via forced alignment and cross-entropy loss instead of
RNNT loss, (2) we show that word prediction and role prediction require
different amounts of predictor's context, leading to separate task-specific
predictors, unlike existing shared-predictor models, and (3) we propose a way
to leverage RD posterior activity to influence ASR decoding and reduce
small-word deletion errors.

TL;DR: The CHiME-7 and 8 challenges advanced multi-channel ASR and diarization, revealing trends like the shift to e2e ASR, reliance on guided source separation, and the importance of diarization refinement. Despite progress, challenges remain in transcribing spontaneous speech in tough environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance research in multi-channel, generalizable ASR and diarization of conversational speech by analyzing trends from participant submissions in the CHiME-7 and 8 challenges.

Method: Analysis of challenge design, evaluation metrics, datasets, baseline systems, and key trends from 32 diverse systems submitted by 9 teams.

Result: Key findings include the dominance of e2e ASR systems, reliance on guided source separation, importance of diarization refinement, and weak correlation between transcription quality and downstream tasks like summarization.

Conclusion: While significant progress has been made, challenges persist in accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in complex acoustic environments, even with advanced techniques.

Abstract: The CHiME-7 and 8 distant speech recognition (DASR) challenges focus on
multi-channel, generalizable, joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
diarization of conversational speech. With participation from 9 teams
submitting 32 diverse systems, these challenges have contributed to
state-of-the-art research in the field. This paper outlines the challenges'
design, evaluation metrics, datasets, and baseline systems while analyzing key
trends from participant submissions. From this analysis it emerges that: 1)
Most participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were
prevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the
availability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data
burden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and
enhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,
suggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal
with complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems
employ diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.
Accurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to
avoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on
this part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate
weakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of
large-language models in handling errors. On the NOTSOFAR-1 scenario, even
systems with over 50\% time-constrained minimum permutation WER can perform
roughly on par with the most effective ones (around 11\%). 5) Despite recent
progress, accurately transcribing spontaneous speech in challenging acoustic
environments remains difficult, even when using computationally intensive
system ensembles.

*Davide Ghia,Gabriele Ciravegna,Alkis Koudounas,Marco Fantini,Erika Crosetti,Giovanni Succo,Tania Cerquitelli*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper explores Explainable AI (XAI) for diagnosing voice disorders, comparing concept-based models (CBM, CEM) to traditional DNNs for better interpretability without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voice disorders impact many people, and automated, non-invasive diagnosis could improve healthcare. Current AI models lack transparency, limiting clinical trust.

Method: Investigates concept-based models (CBM, CEM) under the XAI framework to enhance interpretability while maintaining performance.

Result: Concept-based models achieve comparable performance to traditional DNNs but with greater transparency.

Conclusion: XAI, particularly concept-based models, offers a promising balance of performance and interpretability for clinical voice disorder diagnosis.

Abstract: Voice disorders affect a significant portion of the population, and the
ability to diagnose them using automated, non-invasive techniques would
represent a substantial advancement in healthcare, improving the quality of
life of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated that artificial intelligence
models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), can effectively address this
task. However, due to their complexity, the decision-making process of such
models often remain opaque, limiting their trustworthiness in clinical
contexts. This paper investigates an alternative approach based on Explainable
AI (XAI), a field that aims to improve the interpretability of DNNs by
providing different forms of explanations. Specifically, this works focuses on
concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM) and Concept
Embedding Model (CEM) and how they can achieve performance comparable to
traditional deep learning methods, while offering a more transparent and
interpretable decision framework.

*Jaechul Roh,Zachary Novack,Yuefeng Peng,Niloofar Mireshghallah,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick,Amir Houmansadr*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper explores vulnerabilities in Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models, revealing memorization issues through Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), where altered lyrics trigger similar outputs. It also uncovers phonetic-to-visual regurgitation in text-to-video models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate underexplored vulnerabilities in LS2 models, focusing on memorization risks and their implications for multimodal generative systems.

Method: Introduces APT, using homophonic substitutions to alter lyrics while preserving acoustic structure, and tests models like SUNO and YuE for memorization. Also examines text-to-video models like Veo 3.

Result: Models regenerate training-like content despite phonetic distortions, with high audio similarity. Phonetically altered lyrics also trigger visual memorization in text-to-video models.

Conclusion: The findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in transcript-conditioned multimodal generation, raising concerns about copyright, safety, and content provenance.

Abstract: Lyrics-to-Song (LS2) generation models promise end-to-end music synthesis
from text, yet their vulnerability to training data memorization remains
underexplored. We introduce Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel
attack where lyrics are semantically altered while preserving their acoustic
structure through homophonic substitutions (e.g., Eminem's famous "mom's
spaghetti" $\rightarrow$ "Bob's confetti"). Despite these distortions, we
uncover a powerful form of sub-lexical memorization: models like SUNO and YuE
regenerate outputs strikingly similar to known training content, achieving high
similarity across audio-domain metrics, including CLAP, AudioJudge, and
CoverID. This vulnerability persists across multiple languages and genres. More
surprisingly, we discover that phoneme-altered lyrics alone can trigger visual
memorization in text-to-video models. When prompted with phonetically modified
lyrics from Lose Yourself, Veo 3 reconstructs visual elements from the original
music video -- including character appearance and scene composition -- despite
no visual cues in the prompt. We term this phenomenon phonetic-to-visual
regurgitation. Together, these findings expose a critical vulnerability in
transcript-conditioned multimodal generation: phonetic prompting alone can
unlock memorized audiovisual content, raising urgent questions about copyright,
safety, and content provenance in modern generative systems. Example
generations are available on our demo page (jrohsc.github.io/music_attack/).

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The study analyzes 1.5 million posts from 400 key opinion leaders (KOLs) on X (2021-2023) to explore anticipatory discourse on tech futures. Using text mining, it identifies 100 topics, highlighting KOLs' dual role in shaping optimistic tech visions and influencing societal debates. Hope dominates, but Anxiety arises in topics like climate change and geopolitics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how KOLs frame and influence anticipatory discourse around emerging technologies (e.g., AI) and their societal impact during uncertainty.

Method: Analyzed 1.5 million posts from 400 KOLs on X (2021-2023) using BERTopic modelling, sentiment, emotion, and attitude analyses.

Result: Identified 100 topics reflecting tech-driven futures, with Hope as the dominant emotion. Anxiety was notable in discussions on climate change and geopolitics. KOLs mediate societal narratives by framing tech as solutions.

Conclusion: KOLs play a pivotal role in shaping public perceptions of emerging technologies, bridging imagined futures with current realities, and directing attention during uncertainty.

Abstract: The volatility and unpredictability of emerging technologies, such as
artificial intelligence (AI), generate significant uncertainty, which is widely
discussed on social media. This study examines anticipatory discourse
surrounding technological futures by analysing 1.5 million posts from 400 key
opinion leaders (KOLs) published on the X platform (from 2021 to 2023). Using
advanced text mining techniques, including BERTopic modelling, sentiment,
emotion, and attitude analyses, the research identifies 100 distinct topics
reflecting anticipated tech-driven futures. Our findings emphasize the dual
role of KOLs in framing \textit{present futures} -- optimistic visions of
transformative technologies like AI and IoT -- and influencing \textit{future
presents}, where these projections shape contemporary societal and geopolitical
debates. Positive emotions such as Hope dominate, outweighing Anxiety,
particularly in topics like ``Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep
Learning,'' while discussions around ``Climate Change'' and ``War, Ukraine, and
Trump People'' elicit \textit{Anxiety}. By framing technologies as solutions to
societal challenges, KOLs act as mediators of societal narratives, bridging
imagined futures and current realities. These insights underscore their pivotal
role in directing public attention with emerging technologies during periods of
heightened uncertainty, advancing our understanding of anticipatory discourse
in technology-mediated contexts.

*Mingkun Xia,Haitao Lin,Weiwei Zhang*

Main category: physics.flu-dyn

TL;DR: Hi-π combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression to discover key dimensionless parameters, validated in fluid mechanics examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing redundancy in high-dimensional systems to find physically meaningful dimensionless parameters.

Method: Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-π), a physics-data hybrid approach integrating dimensional analysis and symbolic regression.

Result: Accurately extracted key parameters (e.g., Rayleigh, Prandtl numbers) in fluid mechanics, balancing accuracy and complexity.

Conclusion: Hi-π effectively discovers hierarchical dimensionless parameters, demonstrating broad applicability in physics.

Abstract: Dimensional analysis provides a universal framework for reducing physical
complexity and reveal inherent laws. However, its application to
high-dimensional systems still generates redundant dimensionless parameters,
making it challenging to establish physically meaningful descriptions. Here, we
introduce Hierarchical Dimensionless Learning (Hi-{\pi}), a physics-data
hybrid-driven method that combines dimensional analysis and symbolic regression
to automatically discover key dimensionless parameter combination(s). We
applied this method to classic examples in various research fields of fluid
mechanics. For the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, this method accurately
extracted two intrinsic dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number and the
Prandtl number, validating its unified representation advantage across
multiscale data. For the viscous flows in a circular pipe, the method
automatically discovers two optimal dimensionless parameters: the Reynolds
number and relative roughness, achieving a balance between accuracy and
complexity. For the compressibility correction in subsonic flow, the method
effectively extracts the classic compressibility correction formulation, while
demonstrating its capability to discover hierarchical structural expressions
through optimal parameter transformations.

TL;DR: The paper examines the impact of chaotic workloads, like DDoS attacks, on 5G core functions, emphasizing diverse resource profiles for SLA compliance and kernel-based monitoring for scalable security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in 5G core deployments, particularly under chaotic workloads like DDoS attacks, ensuring SLA compliance and scalable security.

Method: Analyzes effects of DDoS on NFs using empirical evaluation and packet capture approaches, including kernel-based monitoring.

Result: Diverse resource profiles are essential for SLA compliance, and kernel-based monitoring is effective for scalable security in 5G deployments.

Conclusion: The study provides insights for deploying 5G NFs effectively under chaotic workloads, highlighting resource diversity and kernel-based security monitoring.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale software-based 5G core functions presents
significant challenges due to their reliance on optimized and intelligent
resource provisioning for their services. Many studies have focused on
analyzing the impact of resource allocation for complex deployments using
mathematical models, queue theories, or even Artificial Intelligence (AI). This
paper elucidates the effects of chaotic workloads, generated by Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) on different Network Functions (NFs) on User Equipment
registration performance. Our findings highlight the necessity of diverse
resource profiles to ensure Service-Level Agreement (SLA) compliance in
large-scale 5G core deployments. Additionally, our analysis of packet capture
approaches demonstrates the potential of kernel-based monitoring for scalable
security threat defense. Finally, our empirical evaluation provides insights

*Haoran Gao,Yuanhe Zhang,Zhenhong Zhou,Lei Jiang,Fanyu Meng,Yujia Xiao,Kun Wang,Yang Liu,Junlan Feng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RECALLED is the first method to exploit visual inputs for Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) in large vision-language models (LVLMs), increasing latency and resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing red-teaming studies overlook visual inputs as attack surfaces, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to RCAs.

Method: Uses Vision Guided Optimization for pixel-level adversarial perturbations and Multi-Objective Parallel Losses for universal attack templates.

Result: Increases response latency by 26%, GPU utilization by 20%, and memory consumption.

Conclusion: Exposes LVLM vulnerabilities and provides a red-teaming framework for future RCA defenses.

Abstract: Resource Consumption Attacks (RCAs) have emerged as a significant threat to
the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). With the integration of vision
modalities, additional attack vectors exacerbate the risk of RCAs in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing red-teaming studies have
largely overlooked visual inputs as a potential attack surface, resulting in
insufficient mitigation strategies against RCAs in LVLMs. To address this gap,
we propose RECALLED (\textbf{RE}source \textbf{C}onsumption \textbf{A}ttack on
\textbf{L}arge Vision-\textbf{L}anguag\textbf{E} Mo\textbf{D}els), the first
approach for exploiting visual modalities to trigger unbounded RCAs
red-teaming. First, we present \textit{Vision Guided Optimization}, a
fine-grained pixel-level optimization, to obtain \textit{Output Recall}
adversarial perturbations, which can induce repeating output. Then, we inject
the perturbations into visual inputs, triggering unbounded generations to
achieve the goal of RCAs. Additionally, we introduce \textit{Multi-Objective
Parallel Losses} to generate universal attack templates and resolve
optimization conflicts when intending to implement parallel attacks. Empirical
results demonstrate that RECALLED increases service response latency by over 26
$\uparrow$, resulting in an additional 20\% increase in GPU utilization and
memory consumption. Our study exposes security vulnerabilities in LVLMs and
establishes a red-teaming framework that can facilitate future defense
development against RCAs.

### [280] [LoRA-Leak: Membership Inference Attacks Against LoRA Fine-tuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18302)
*Delong Ran,Xinlei He,Tianshuo Cong,Anyu Wang,Qi Li,Xiaoyun Wang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LoRA-Leak reveals that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs) due to information leakage from pre-trained models, despite LoRA's lightweight nature. The framework evaluates 15 MIAs and identifies effective defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the misconception that LoRA fine-tuning data is immune to MIAs and highlight the overlooked privacy risks from pre-trained models.

Method: Introduces LoRA-Leak, a framework with 15 MIAs (10 existing, 5 improved) leveraging pre-trained models, tested on three LMs across NLP tasks.

Result: LoRA-based LMs are vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC). Dropout and excluding specific layers mitigate risks without losing utility.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models exacerbate MIA risks for LoRA-based LMs, necessitating better privacy protections for specialized LM providers.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) typically adhere to a "pre-training and fine-tuning"
paradigm, where a universal pre-trained model can be fine-tuned to cater to
various specialized domains. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most
widespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and
remarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is
relatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA
fine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).
However, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more
information leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we
introduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the
fine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership
inference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that
leverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply
LoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language
processing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still
vulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).
We also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the
resulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only
dropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively
mitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the
"pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model
makes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can
provide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.

Motivation: Phishing emails exploit human vulnerabilities, and ML models' performance depends on training data quality. Existing datasets lack diversity and face issues like class imbalance.

Method: The paper presents MeAJOR Corpus, integrating diverse phishing and legitimate emails with engineered features. Four ML models (RF, XGB, MLP, CNN) were tested.

Result: The dataset achieved 98.34% F1 score with XGB, demonstrating high effectiveness for phishing detection.

Conclusion: MeAJOR Corpus provides a reusable, balanced, and generalizable resource for phishing detection research, addressing key challenges.

Abstract: Phishing emails continue to pose a significant threat to cybersecurity by
exploiting human vulnerabilities through deceptive content and malicious
payloads. While Machine Learning (ML) models are effective at detecting
phishing threats, their performance largely relies on the quality and diversity
of the training data. This paper presents MeAJOR (Merged email Assets from
Joint Open-source Repositories) Corpus, a novel, multi-source phishing email
dataset designed to overcome critical limitations in existing resources. It
integrates 135894 samples representing a broad number of phishing tactics and
legitimate emails, with a wide spectrum of engineered features. We evaluated
the dataset's utility for phishing detection research through systematic
experiments with four classification models (RF, XGB, MLP, and CNN) across
multiple feature configurations. Results highlight the dataset's effectiveness,
achieving 98.34% F1 with XGB. By integrating broad features from multiple
categories, our dataset provides a reusable and consistent resource, while
addressing common challenges like class imbalance, generalisability and
reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security measures struggle with evolving threats, prompting the need for intelligent solutions like LLMs.

Method: The paper reviews LLM applications in security tasks, leveraging neural networks and Transformer architecture for improved accuracy.

Result: LLMs enhance detection accuracy and reduce false alarms in security systems.

Conclusion: While promising, LLMs face challenges in transparency and adaptability, requiring further optimization for smarter security solutions.

Abstract: Information security is facing increasingly severe challenges, and
traditional protection means are difficult to cope with complex and changing
threats. In recent years, as an emerging intelligent technology, large language
models (LLMs) have shown a broad application prospect in the field of
information security. In this paper, we focus on the key role of LLM in
information security, systematically review its application progress in
malicious behavior prediction, network threat analysis, system vulnerability
detection, malicious code identification, and cryptographic algorithm
optimization, and explore its potential in enhancing security protection
performance. Based on neural networks and Transformer architecture, this paper
analyzes the technical basis of large language models and their advantages in
natural language processing tasks. It is shown that the introduction of large
language modeling helps to improve the detection accuracy and reduce the false
alarm rate of security systems. Finally, this paper summarizes the current
application results and points out that it still faces challenges in model
transparency, interpretability, and scene adaptability, among other issues. It
is necessary to explore further the optimization of the model structure and the
improvement of the generalization ability to realize a more intelligent and
accurate information security protection system.

### [283] [NWaaS: Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service for X-to-Image DNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18036)
*Haonan An,Guang Hua,Yu Guo,Hangcheng Cao,Susanto Rahardja,Yuguang Fang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Nonintrusive Watermarking as a Service (NWaaS) and its implementation, ShadowMark, to protect DNN models without modifying them, addressing concerns of intrusiveness and fidelity-robustness trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DNN watermarking methods are intrusive, altering model parameters or structure, which raises concerns about behavior shifts and costs, limiting practical adoption.

Method: Proposes NWaaS and ShadowMark, a nonintrusive solution using a side channel in the model's black-box API with a key encoder and watermark decoder.

Result: ShadowMark achieves absolute fidelity, works across DNN architectures, and is robust against attacks, validated by experiments on various models.

Conclusion: ShadowMark offers a practical, nonintrusive solution for DNN watermarking, enabling real-world deployment without compromising model integrity.

Abstract: The intellectual property of deep neural network (DNN) models can be
protected with DNN watermarking, which embeds copyright watermarks into model
parameters (white-box), model behavior (black-box), or model outputs
(box-free), and the watermarks can be subsequently extracted to verify model
ownership or detect model theft. Despite recent advances, these existing
methods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or
alter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about
watermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of
fine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a
result, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,
which limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)
systems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a
Service (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in
which we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark
can still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose
ShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical
deployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in
the protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark
decoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining
the so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN
architectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating
the fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,
noise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate
the efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of
nonintrusive DNN watermarking.

Motivation: To adapt CCA for real-time, high-dimensional streaming data analysis.

Method: Uses streaming PCA and a sliding window of samples to estimate CCA components online.

Result: Demonstrates applicability and scalability to high dimensions with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: SWICCA is effective for real-time, high-dimensional streaming data analysis.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlated
sets of features between two datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel
extension of CCA to the online, streaming data setting: Sliding Window
Informative Canonical Correlation Analysis (SWICCA). Our method uses a
streaming principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm as a backend and uses
these outputs combined with a small sliding window of samples to estimate the
CCA components in real time. We motivate and describe our algorithm, provide
numerical simulations to characterize its performance, and provide a
theoretical performance guarantee. The SWICCA method is applicable and scalable
to extremely high dimensions, and we provide a real-data example that
demonstrates this capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the power and efficiency of A/B testing for policy evaluation and product deployment in technology companies.

Method: 1. Doubly robust estimation for pseudo-outcomes. 2. Two-armed bandit framework for test statistic. 3. Permutation-based p-value computation.

Result: The method shows superior performance in asymptotic theories, numerical experiments, and real-world ridesharing data.

Conclusion: The proposed two-armed bandit framework effectively enhances A/B testing power, validated by theory and practical applications.

Abstract: A/B testing is widely used in modern technology companies for policy
evaluation and product deployment, with the goal of comparing the outcomes
under a newly-developed policy against a standard control. Various causal
inference and reinforcement learning methods developed in the literature are
applicable to A/B testing. This paper introduces a two-armed bandit framework
designed to improve the power of existing approaches. The proposed procedure
consists of three main steps: (i) employing doubly robust estimation to
generate pseudo-outcomes, (ii) utilizing a two-armed bandit framework to
construct the test statistic, and (iii) applying a permutation-based method to
compute the $p$-value. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
through asymptotic theories, numerical experiments and real-world data from a
ridesharing company, showing its superior performance in comparison to existing
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate vulnerabilities in machine learning models where adversaries can reconstruct training data from released model specifications and parameters.

Method: Develops a mathematical framework, uses maximum mean discrepancy to identify vulnerable data features, and introduces a score matching framework for data reconstruction in Bayesian and non-Bayesian models.

Result: First literature instance of Bayesian model data reconstruction and a comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing training data vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: The paper provides tools to understand and counter training data reconstruction attacks, enhancing machine learning model security.

Abstract: Publicly releasing the specification of a model with its trained parameters
means an adversary can attempt to reconstruct information about the training
data via training data reconstruction attacks, a major vulnerability of modern
machine learning methods. This paper makes three primary contributions:
establishing a mathematical framework to express the problem, characterising
the features of the training data that are vulnerable via a maximum mean
discrepancy equivalance and outlining a score matching framework for
reconstructing data in both Bayesian and non-Bayesian models, the former is a
first in the literature.

*Miguel Aspis,Sebastián A. Cajas Ordónez,Andrés L. Suárez-Cetrulo,Ricardo Simón Carbajo*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: DriftMoE introduces an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with a neural router and incremental Hoeffding tree experts for efficient concept drift adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptive ensemble methods lack fine-grained adaptation and optimal knowledge utilization, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.

Method: DriftMoE uses a co-training framework with a neural router and incremental Hoeffding tree experts, enabling expert specialization through a symbiotic learning loop.

Result: DriftMoE achieves competitive performance on nine data stream benchmarks, handling abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts effectively.

Conclusion: DriftMoE provides a principled and efficient approach to concept drift adaptation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Learning from non-stationary data streams subject to concept drift requires
models that can adapt on-the-fly while remaining resource-efficient. Existing
adaptive ensemble methods often rely on coarse-grained adaptation mechanisms or
simple voting schemes that fail to optimally leverage specialized knowledge.
This paper introduces DriftMoE, an online Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that addresses these limitations through a novel co-training framework.
DriftMoE features a compact neural router that is co-trained alongside a pool
of incremental Hoeffding tree experts. The key innovation lies in a symbiotic
learning loop that enables expert specialization: the router selects the most
suitable expert for prediction, the relevant experts update incrementally with
the true label, and the router refines its parameters using a multi-hot
correctness mask that reinforces every accurate expert. This feedback loop
provides the router with a clear training signal while accelerating expert
specialization. We evaluate DriftMoE's performance across nine state-of-the-art
data stream learning benchmarks spanning abrupt, gradual, and real-world drifts
testing two distinct configurations: one where experts specialize on data
regimes (multi-class variant), and another where they focus on single-class
specialization (task-based variant). Our results demonstrate that DriftMoE

### [288] [Euclidean Distance Deflation Under High-Dimensional Heteroskedastic Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18520)
*Keyi Li,Yuval Kluger,Boris Landa*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of correcting pairwise Euclidean distances distorted by heteroskedastic noise in high-dimensional settings, proposing a hyperparameter-free method with theoretical guarantees and practical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heteroskedastic noise distorts pairwise distances in machine learning and data analysis, necessitating a reliable method to estimate noise magnitudes and correct distances without prior assumptions.

Method: A principled, hyperparameter-free approach jointly estimates noise magnitudes and corrects distances, supported by theoretical bounds on estimation errors.

Result: The method achieves accurate noise estimation and distance correction, validated on synthetic and real-world (single-cell RNA sequencing) datasets.

Conclusion: The approach reliably addresses heteroskedastic noise, enhancing robustness in distance-based computations and downstream analyses.

Abstract: Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.

### [289] [Digital Twin Technologies in Predictive Maintenance: Enabling Transferability via Sim-to-Real and Real-to-Sim Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18449)
*Sizhe Ma,Katherine A. Flanigan,Mario Bergés*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating a Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into Digital Twin (DT) frameworks to manage bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations, addressing the 'reality gap' challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized frameworks for DTs complicates their transition from academia to industry, particularly in managing knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world operations.

Method: The research integrates an RGA module into an existing DT framework, using data pipelines to connect it with components like the historical repository and simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian bridge demonstrates the approach.

Result: Full implementation of the RGA module and data pipeline enables efficient bidirectional knowledge transfer (sim-to-real and real-to-sim) without compromising efficiency.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of RGA modules to enhance DT frameworks by addressing the reality gap, facilitating standardized and efficient lifecycle management.

Abstract: The advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
has catalyzed the evolution of Digital Twins (DTs) from conceptual ideas to
more implementable realities. Yet, transitioning from academia to industry is
complex due to the absence of standardized frameworks. This paper builds upon
the authors' previously established functional and informational requirements
supporting standardized DT development, focusing on a crucial aspect:
transferability. While existing DT research primarily centers on asset
transfer, the significance of "sim-to-real transfer" and "real-to-sim
transfer"--transferring knowledge between simulations and real-world
operations--is vital for comprehensive lifecycle management in DTs. A key
challenge in this process is calibrating the "reality gap," the discrepancy
between simulated predictions and actual outcomes. Our research investigates
the impact of integrating a single Reality Gap Analysis (RGA) module into an
existing DT framework to effectively manage both sim-to-real and real-to-sim
transfers. This integration is facilitated by data pipelines that connect the
RGA module with the existing components of the DT framework, including the
historical repository and the simulation model. A case study on a pedestrian
bridge at Carnegie Mellon University showcases the performance of different
levels of integration of our approach with an existing framework. With full
implementation of an RGA module and a complete data pipeline, our approach is
capable of bidirectional knowledge transfer between simulations and real-world
operations without compromising efficiency.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The study compares GCNs, GATs, and GINs for toxicological assay classification, finding GINs excel in data-abundant settings while GATs perform better in data-scarce ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore the implications of different GNN architectures in cheminformatics for toxicological assay classification.

Method: Pre-processed molecular graphs, enforced class-balance, stratified datasets, and conducted Bayesian optimizations for GCNs, GATs, and GINs across 7 assays.

Result: GINs outperformed in data-abundant assays (AUC 0.728-0.849), while GATs excelled in data-scarce ones. GCNs and GATs had closer hyperparameter states than GINs.

Conclusion: GINs are optimal for data-rich environments, GATs for data-scarce ones, highlighting GINs' uniqueness among GNNs.

Abstract: Geometric deep learning is an emerging technique in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) driven cheminformatics, however the unique implications of different Graph
Neural Network (GNN) architectures are poorly explored, for this space. This
study compared performances of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph
Attention Networks (GATs) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GINs), applied to 7
different toxicological assay datasets of varying data abundance and endpoint,
to perform binary classification of assay activation. Following pre-processing
of molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all
datasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN
applied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).
Optimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from
0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific
assays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for
the top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however
significantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This
indicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant
environments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce
environments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional
hyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that
GCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,
compared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN
algorithm.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: CM-UNet uses self-supervised pre-training and transfer learning to improve coronary artery segmentation with minimal annotated data, reducing reliance on large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate coronary artery segmentation is challenging due to limited annotated datasets, hindering automated tool development for clinical use.

Method: CM-UNet leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated data and transfer learning on limited annotated data.

Result: Fine-tuning with only 18 annotated images (vs. 500) reduced Dice score drop to 15.2% (vs. 46.5% in baseline models).

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning enhances segmentation performance, reduces dataset dependency, and improves clinical workflows.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of coronary arteries remains a significant challenge in
clinical practice, hindering the ability to effectively diagnose and manage
coronary artery disease. The lack of large, annotated datasets for model
training exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools
that could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which
leverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer
learning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while
minimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with
only 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice
score, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This
demonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance
and reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to
highlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary
artery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for
advancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice. By enhancing segmentation
accuracy in X-ray angiography images, the proposed approach aims to improve
clinical workflows, reduce radiologists' workload, and accelerate disease
detection, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes. The source code

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study explores how personalized support in instructional sequences (I-PS vs. PS-I) in scenario-based learning (SBL) improves diagnostic reasoning for pharmacy technician apprentices, finding PS-I more effective for transfer tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novices struggle with cognitive biases in diagnostic reasoning; SBL offers a solution, but optimal instructional sequencing is unclear.

Method: A between-groups design in PharmaSim (online SBL) compares I-PS and PS-I sequences for pharmacy apprentices.

Result: Both instruction types help, but PS-I significantly outperforms I-PS in transfer tasks.

Conclusion: PS-I sequencing is more effective for enhancing transfer of diagnostic reasoning skills in SBL.

Abstract: Supporting students in developing effective diagnostic reasoning is a key
challenge in various educational domains. Novices often struggle with cognitive
biases such as premature closure and over-reliance on heuristics.
Scenario-based learning (SBL) can address these challenges by offering
realistic case experiences and iterative practice, but the optimal sequencing
of instruction and problem-solving activities remains unclear. This study
examines how personalized support can be incorporated into different
instructional sequences and whether providing explicit diagnostic strategy
instruction before (I-PS) or after problem-solving (PS-I) improves learning and
its transfer. We employ a between-groups design in an online SBL environment
called PharmaSim, which simulates real-world client interactions for pharmacy
technician apprentices. Results indicate that while both instruction types are
beneficial, PS-I leads to significantly higher performance in transfer tasks.

*Lars Ullrich,Michael Buchholz,Jonathan Petit,Klaus Dietmayer,Knut Graichen*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage fine-tuning process for scalable adaptation of automated driving (AD) capabilities, addressing technical and socio-political challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability of AD is hindered by diverse vehicle types, sensors, environments, and socio-political factors like regulations and ethics.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning process: (1) country-specific reward model for socio-political adaptation, (2) vehicle-specific transfer learning for technical adaptation.

Result: The concept enables effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical differences.

Conclusion: The proposed data-driven process integrates technological and socio-political aspects for broad AD deployment.

Abstract: Efficient scalability of automated driving (AD) is key to reducing costs,
enhancing safety, conserving resources, and maximizing impact. However,
research focuses on specific vehicles and context, while broad deployment
requires scalability across various configurations and environments.
Differences in vehicle types, sensors, actuators, but also traffic regulations,
legal requirements, cultural dynamics, or even ethical paradigms demand high
flexibility of data-driven developed capabilities. In this paper, we address
the challenge of scalable adaptation of generic capabilities to desired systems
and environments. Our concept follows a two-stage fine-tuning process. In the
first stage, fine-tuning to the specific environment takes place through a
country-specific reward model that serves as an interface between technological
adaptations and socio-political requirements. In the second stage,
vehicle-specific transfer learning facilitates system adaptation and governs
the validation of design decisions. In sum, our concept offers a data-driven
process that integrates both technological and socio-political aspects,
enabling effective scalability across technical, legal, cultural, and ethical
differences.

TL;DR: Dual-agent LLM setups outperform single agents in math problem-solving, with peer-to-peer collaboration being the most effective. Communication strategies like statements, acknowledgment, and hints are crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the impact of different communication strategies among LLM agents in collaborative problem-solving for AI-aided education.

Method: Examined four communication modes (teacher-student, peer-to-peer, reciprocal teaching, critical debate) in a dual-agent setup using GPT-4o on the MATH dataset.

Result: Peer-to-peer collaboration achieved the highest accuracy. Dual-agent setups outperformed single agents.

Conclusion: Effective communication strategies are essential for complex problem-solving in AI education, with peer-to-peer collaboration being optimal.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly utilized in AI-aided
education to support tutoring and learning. Effective communication strategies
among LLM agents improve collaborative problem-solving efficiency and
facilitate cost-effective adoption in education. However, little research has
systematically evaluated the impact of different communication strategies on
agents' problem-solving. Our study examines four communication modes,
\textit{teacher-student interaction}, \textit{peer-to-peer collaboration},
\textit{reciprocal peer teaching}, and \textit{critical debate}, in a
dual-agent, chat-based mathematical problem-solving environment using the
OpenAI GPT-4o model. Evaluated on the MATH dataset, our results show that
dual-agent setups outperform single agents, with \textit{peer-to-peer
collaboration} achieving the highest accuracy. Dialogue acts like statements,
acknowledgment, and hints play a key role in collaborative problem-solving.
While multi-agent frameworks enhance computational tasks, effective
communication strategies are essential for tackling complex problems in AI
education.

Motivation: Address clinician burnout by automating medical documentation with AI.

Method: Integration of Whisper for transcription and GPT-4o for generating SOAP notes, tested on mock visit data and fine-tuned with BART for conciseness.

Result: Notes exceed expert-written quality, reduce cognitive load (94% of clinicians), and lessen documentation burden (97%). Over 540 clinicians adopted it.

Conclusion: AI systems can effectively reduce administrative burdens and enhance care quality.

Abstract: Clinician burnout has motivated the growing adoption of ambient medical
scribes in the clinic. In this work, we introduce a custom-built ambient scribe
application integrated into the EHR system at Included Health, a personalized
all-in-one healthcare company offering telehealth services. The application
uses Whisper for transcription and a modular in-context learning pipeline with
GPT-4o to automatically generate SOAP notes and patient instructions. Testing
on mock visit data shows that the notes generated by the application exceed the
quality of expert-written notes as determined by an LLM-as-a-judge. The
application has been widely adopted by the clinical practice, with over 540
clinicians at Included Health using the application at least once. 94% (n = 63)
of surveyed clinicians report reduced cognitive load during visits and 97% (n =
66) report less documentation burden when using the application. Additionally,
we show that post-processing notes with a fine-tuned BART model improves
conciseness. These findings highlight the potential for AI systems to ease
administrative burdens and support clinicians in delivering efficient,

Motivation: To rethink traditional human-centered design workflows by integrating AI as a creative collaborator, not just a tool for automation.

Method: Investigates the use of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) and multimodal diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) in iterative design cycles of proposal, critique, and revision.

Result: Highlights the potential of AI as an active participant in creative processes, enabling new forms of collaboration.

Conclusion: Human-AI co-creation represents a transformative shift in design workflows, leveraging AI's generative capabilities for enhanced ideation and decision-making.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to evolve from a back-end

TL;DR: PosterMate is a poster design assistant that uses AI-generated persona agents to simulate diverse audience feedback, facilitating collaborative design edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gathering diverse audience feedback for poster design is challenging, and generative AI models offer potential solutions.

Method: PosterMate creates persona agents from marketing documents, gathers feedback, and moderates discussions to reach design conclusions.

Result: User studies showed PosterMate captures overlooked viewpoints and synthesizes diverse perspectives effectively.

Conclusion: PosterMate demonstrates promise as a prototyping tool for collaborative poster design.

Abstract: Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.

TL;DR: The paper explores educator-AI interactions using a human-AI collaborative method to analyze 140,000 messages, finding LLMs like Claude 3.5 Haiku effective in qualitative coding and revealing key educator-AI engagement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how educators use AI tools in practice and develop scalable methods to study these interactions.

Method: A four-phase coding pipeline combining inductive theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model benchmarking.

Result: LLMs reliably support theme identification and outperform open-weight models. Educators primarily use AI for instructional enhancement (79.7%), content creation (76.1%), and assessment (46.9%).

Conclusion: The study provides a scalable model for AI-augmented research and insights into AI's role in education, with implications for teacher training.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational tools has
the potential to substantially impact how teachers plan instruction, support
diverse learners, and engage in professional reflection. Yet little is known
about how educators actually use these tools in practice and how their
interactions with AI can be meaningfully studied at scale. This paper presents
a human-AI collaborative methodology for large-scale qualitative analysis of
over 140,000 educator-AI messages drawn from a generative AI platform used by
K-12 teachers. Through a four-phase coding pipeline, we combined inductive
theme discovery, codebook development, structured annotation, and model
benchmarking to examine patterns of educator engagement and evaluate the
performance of LLMs in qualitative coding tasks. We developed a hierarchical
codebook aligned with established teacher evaluation frameworks, capturing
educators' instructional goals, contextual needs, and pedagogical strategies.
Our findings demonstrate that LLMs, particularly Claude 3.5 Haiku, can reliably
support theme identification, extend human recognition in complex scenarios,
and outperform open-weight models in both accuracy and structural reliability.
The analysis also reveals substantive patterns in how educators inquire AI to
enhance instructional practices (79.7 percent of total conversations), create
or adapt content (76.1 percent), support assessment and feedback loop (46.9
percent), attend to student needs for tailored instruction (43.3 percent), and
assist other professional responsibilities (34.2 percent), highlighting

Conclusion: The framework is scalable and interpretable, with applications in adaptive learning, HCI, and education.

Abstract: Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and

*Juntao Zhao,Jiuru Li,Chuan Wu*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: Sandwich is a CPU-based LLM serving engine that optimizes prefill and decode phases separately, achieving significant performance improvements over existing solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CPU-based LLM serving solutions are suboptimal due to static partitioning and vendor libraries, ignoring workload differences between prefill and decode phases.

Method: Sandwich uses distinct execution plans for prefill and decode phases, optimizing them separately and generating efficient GEMM kernels.

Result: Sandwich achieves 2.01x higher throughput, 90% satisfactory latencies, and up to 3.40x lower requirements in single-sequence serving, with notable improvements in continuous-batching serving.

Conclusion: Sandwich demonstrates superior performance and efficiency, making CPU-based LLM serving more viable.

Abstract: Utilizing CPUs to serve large language models (LLMs) is a resource-friendly
alternative to GPU serving. Existing CPU-based solutions ignore workload
differences between the prefill and the decode phases of LLM inference,
applying a static per-NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node model partition and
utilizing vendor libraries for operator-level execution, which is suboptimal.
We propose Sandwich, a hardware-centric CPU-based LLM serving engine that uses
different execution plans for the prefill and decode phases and optimizes them
separately.
  We evaluate Sandwich across diverse baselines and datasets on five CPU
platforms, including x86 with AVX-2 and AVX-512, as well as ARM with NEON.
Sandwich achieves an average 2.01x throughput improvement and 90% satisfactory
time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT) latencies with up
to 3.40x lower requirements in single sequence serving, and significant
improvement in Goodput in continuous-batching serving. The GEMM kernels
generated by Sandwich outperform representative vendor kernels and other
dynamic shape solutions, achieving performance comparable to static compilers
with three orders of magnitude less kernel tuning costs.

### [305] [Nonconvex Optimization Framework for Group-Sparse Feedback Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control I: Penalty Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18114)
*Lechen Feng,Xun Li,Yuan-Hua Ni*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: A unified nonconvex optimization framework for designing group-sparse feedback controllers in LQ problems, addressing DFT-LQ and SF-LQ with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems, overcoming limitations of convex relaxations and restrictive structural assumptions.

Method: Formulates controller synthesis as a nonconvex optimization with group ℓ0-norm regularization, proposes PALM algorithm with convergence analysis.

Result: Enables direct design of group-sparse feedback gains with global convergence to critical points.

Conclusion: Fills a key gap in literature by providing theoretical guarantees for group-sparse feedback design without convex surrogates.

Abstract: This paper develops a unified nonconvex optimization framework for the design
of group-sparse feedback controllers in infinite-horizon linear-quadratic (LQ)
problems. We address two prominent extensions of the classical LQ problem: the
distributed LQ problem with fixed communication topology (DFT-LQ) and the
sparse feedback LQ problem (SF-LQ), both of which are motivated by the need for
scalable and structure-aware control in large-scale systems. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on convex relaxations or are limited to block-diagonal
structures, we directly formulate the controller synthesis as a
finite-dimensional nonconvex optimization problem with group $\ell_0$-norm
regularization, capturing general sparsity patterns. We establish a connection
between DFT-LQ and SF-LQ problems, showing that both can be addressed within
our unified framework. Furthermore, we propose a penalty-based proximal
alternating linearized minimization (PALM) algorithm and provide a rigorous
convergence analysis under mild assumptions, overcoming the lack of coercivity
in the objective function. The proposed method admits efficient solvers for all
subproblems and guarantees global convergence to critical points. Our results
fill a key gap in the literature by enabling the direct design of group-sparse
feedback gains with theoretical guarantees, without resorting to convex
surrogates or restrictive structural assumptions.

TL;DR: A hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble model integrates video, audio, and language embeddings to predict cortical fMRI responses, ranking third in a competition with strong performance on challenging subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately predict distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli by integrating visual, auditory, and semantic information over time.

Method: Uses modality-specific bidirectional RNNs for temporal encoding, fuses hidden states, and employs lightweight subject-specific heads. Training involves a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum focusing on sensory to association regions. Averaging 100 model variants enhances robustness.

Result: Achieved an overall Pearson r = 0.2094, with the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63), particularly strong for challenging subjects.

Conclusion: The model provides a simple, extensible baseline for future multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurately predicting distributed cortical responses to naturalistic stimuli
requires models that integrate visual, auditory and semantic information over
time. We present a hierarchical multimodal recurrent ensemble that maps
pretrained video, audio, and language embeddings to fMRI time series recorded
while four subjects watched almost 80 hours of movies provided by the Algonauts
2025 challenge. Modality-specific bidirectional RNNs encode temporal dynamics;
their hidden states are fused and passed to a second recurrent layer, and
lightweight subject-specific heads output responses for 1000 cortical parcels.
Training relies on a composite MSE-correlation loss and a curriculum that
gradually shifts emphasis from early sensory to late association regions.
Averaging 100 model variants further boosts robustness. The resulting system
ranked third on the competition leaderboard, achieving an overall Pearson r =
0.2094 and the highest single-parcel peak score (mean r = 0.63) among all
participants, with particularly strong gains for the most challenging subject
(Subject 5). The approach establishes a simple, extensible baseline for future
multimodal brain-encoding benchmarks.

*Xinyuan Yan,Rita Sevastjanova,Sinie van der Ben,Mennatallah El-Assady,Bei Wang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for semi-automatic annotation of topological structures in LLM embedding spaces using mapper graphs and LLM-based agents for scalable analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces manually is labor-intensive, necessitating a semi-automated approach.

Method: A taxonomy of mapper graph elements is defined, and two types of customizable LLM-based agents use perturbation techniques for annotation and analysis.

Result: The framework is demonstrated through case studies, replicating prior findings on BERT's embeddings and revealing new linguistic properties.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively automates the exploration of LLM embedding spaces, enhancing understanding of their topological and linguistic properties.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce high-dimensional embeddings that capture
rich semantic and syntactic relationships between words, sentences, and
concepts. Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via
mapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.
Specifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the
embedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood
(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their
corresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these
embedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable
human effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for
semi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the
exploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a
mapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The
annotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable
LLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated
analysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of
mapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations. We
instantiate the framework within a visual analytics workspace and demonstrate
its effectiveness through case studies. In particular, we replicate findings
from prior research on BERT's embedding properties across various layers of its
architecture and provide further observations into the linguistic properties of
topological neighborhoods.

*Rameen Abdal,Or Patashnik,Ekaterina Deyneka,Hao Chen,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Sergey Tulyakov,Daniel Cohen-Or,Kfir Aberman*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A zero-shot framework for dynamic concept personalization in text-to-video models using Grid-LoRA adapters and a Grid Fill module, eliminating per-instance fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic concept personalization require per-instance fine-tuning, which limits scalability.

Method: Leverages structured 2x2 video grids and lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and composition, with a Grid Fill module for inference.

Result: Produces temporally coherent, identity-preserving outputs without test-time optimization, generalizing to unseen concepts.

Conclusion: The framework enables scalable, high-quality dynamic concept personalization in a single forward pass.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have enabled high-quality
synthesis from text and image prompts. While the personalization of dynamic
concepts, which capture subject-specific appearance and motion from a single
video, is now feasible, most existing methods require per-instance fine-tuning,
limiting scalability. We introduce a fully zero-shot framework for dynamic
concept personalization in text-to-video models. Our method leverages
structured 2x2 video grids that spatially organize input and output pairs,
enabling the training of lightweight Grid-LoRA adapters for editing and
composition within these grids. At inference, a dedicated Grid Fill module
completes partially observed layouts, producing temporally coherent and
identity preserving outputs. Once trained, the entire system operates in a
single forward pass, generalizing to previously unseen dynamic concepts without
any test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate high-quality and
consistent results across a wide range of subjects beyond trained concepts and
editing scenarios.

### [309] [GeoAvatar: Adaptive Geometrical Gaussian Splatting for 3D Head Avatar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18155)
*SeungJun Moon,Hah Min Lew,Seungeun Lee,Ji-Su Kang,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GeoAvatar improves 3D head avatar generation by balancing identity preservation and animation using adaptive Gaussian Splatting, a novel mouth structure, and a regularization loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with balancing identity reconstruction and animation due to poor adaptation of Gaussians to facial geometry variations.

Method: GeoAvatar uses Adaptive Pre-allocation Stage (APS) to segment Gaussians, introduces a mouth structure and part-wise deformation, and applies a regularization loss for rigging.

Result: GeoAvatar outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and animation, validated by the DynamicFace dataset.

Conclusion: GeoAvatar effectively addresses the challenge of balancing identity preservation and animation in 3D head avatars.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D head avatar generation, balancing identity
preservation, i.e., reconstruction, with novel poses and expressions, i.e.,
animation, remains a challenge. Existing methods struggle to adapt Gaussians to
varying geometrical deviations across facial regions, resulting in suboptimal
quality. To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive
geometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation
Stage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and
flexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy
and dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise
deformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,
we propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM
faces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive
facial motions. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GeoAvatar
compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and novel animation
scenarios.

*Zhen Han,Mattias Teye,Derek Yadgaroff,Judith Bütepage*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for real-time, on-device speech-driven 3D facial animation using hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling, reducing model size and audio context requirements while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the lack of large datasets and the prohibitive size of existing models for offline inference, enabling real-time, on-device facial animation for applications like game development.

Method: Hybrid knowledge distillation with pseudo-labeling, using a high-performing teacher model to train small student models with convolutional and fully-connected layers, eliminating attention or recurrent updates.

Result: Reduced memory footprint to 3.4 MB and required future audio context to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations.

Conclusion: The approach enables on-device inference, advancing realistic, model-driven digital characters.

Abstract: The training of high-quality, robust machine learning models for
speech-driven 3D facial animation requires a large, diverse dataset of
high-quality audio-animation pairs. To overcome the lack of such a dataset,
recent work has introduced large pre-trained speech encoders that are robust to
variations in the input audio and, therefore, enable the facial animation model
to generalize across speakers, audio quality, and languages. However, the
resulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves
only to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore
on-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game
development. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge
distillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a
high-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast
to the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of
convolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention
context or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can
reduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context
to up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations. This paves the way
for on-device inference, an important step towards realistic, model-driven
digital characters.

*Yixiao Chen,Bin Liang,Hanzhi Guo,Yongqing Cheng,Jiayi Zhao,Dongdong Weng*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PS-GS integrates Gaussian Splatting with MVPS for efficient inverse rendering, improving 3D reconstruction accuracy and enabling novel-view synthesis, relighting, and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inverse rendering methods with fixed illumination lack accuracy. MVPS offers better results but is inefficient. PS-GS addresses this gap.

Method: Uses Gaussian Splatting for initial geometry, deferred inverse rendering with a lighting MLP, and regularizes normals. Introduces 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for lighting refinement.

Result: Outperforms prior works in accuracy and efficiency, validated on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: PS-GS effectively combines MVPS and inverse rendering, offering superior reconstruction and practical applications like relighting.

Abstract: Integrating inverse rendering with multi-view photometric stereo (MVPS)
yields more accurate 3D reconstructions than the inverse rendering approaches
that rely on fixed environment illumination. However, efficient inverse
rendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the
Gaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently
and jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that
is illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first
reconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.
Based on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse
rendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing
multi-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the
rendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.
We also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to
refine the incident lighting. The regularizations and the use of multi-view and
multi-light images mitigate the ill-posed problem of inverse rendering. After
optimization, the reconstructed object can be used for novel-view synthesis,
relighting, and material and shape editing. Experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms prior works in terms of
reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Contemporary database systems, while effective, suffer severe issues related
to complexity and usability, especially among individuals who lack technical
expertise but are unfamiliar with query languages like Structured Query
Language (SQL). This paper presents a new database system supported by
Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is intended to improve the management of

strengthen the potential of databases through the integration of Large Language
Models (LLMs) and advanced machine learning algorithms. The integration is
purposed to allow the automation of fundamental tasks such as data modeling,
schema creation, query comprehension, and performance optimization. We present
in this paper a system that aims to alleviate the main problems with current
database technologies. It is meant to reduce the need for technical skills,
manual tuning for better performance, and the potential for human error. The AI
database employs generative schema inference and format selection to build its
schema models and execution formats.

However, deploying these fixed models in\nreal-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess\nheterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to\ndeploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression\nmethods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve\nefficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing\nresource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable\nand Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by\nstitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires\naddressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal\nstitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models,\nand choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these\nchallenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the\nstitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers\nfrom a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To\nfacilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This\ndesign enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging\navailable resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN,\nTransformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching,\nallowing to combine different model families flexibly.

We first introduce a linear layer calibration method\nfor low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a\nsmall image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization.\nWe then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies\nclipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization\nthresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nQ-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving\nefficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses\nexisting state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for\nultra-low 2-bit quantization.

We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

According to the \\textit{neural\nadaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg\nkinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of\nthis kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to\nretain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real\nexperiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy\nbeach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,\nand 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of\nasphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed\nthat our odometry estimation incorporating the \\textit{neural leg kinematics\nmodel} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

We\ninvestigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide\nneedle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning\nstage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan\nquality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of\none selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined\nreward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent\nthen moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple\nrounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.\nPlan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for\ntesting) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric\nmetrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the\nclinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical\nplans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no\nstatistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate\nV150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans\nuse 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the\nfirst study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to\nautonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.\nThis RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to\nconventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles.

This complex\ninterplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately\nlinked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that\nrepresents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep\nlearning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In\nthis representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while\nedges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two\nmain steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to\nlearn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the\ngraph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by\npreviously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial\ncoordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes\nfeatures on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned\nstatistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,\nensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential\nfeatures of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst\nnetworks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the\ndatabase, by using geometry and topology metrics.

### [1] [GAITEX: Human motion dataset from impaired gait and rehabilitation exercises of inertial and optical sensor data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21069)
*Andreas Spilz,Heiko Oppel,Jochen Werner,Kathrin Stucke-Straub,Felix Capanni,Michael Munz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises and gait patterns, recorded using IMUs and MoCap, supports ML model development for movement analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of large, diverse datasets for robust sensor-based classification models in physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis.

Method: Recorded data from 19 participants using synchronized IMUs and MoCap, including raw and processed data, annotations, and tools for analysis.

Result: Provided a comprehensive dataset with raw and processed IMU data, MoCap reference, OpenSim models, and tools for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The dataset accelerates ML-driven human movement analysis by enabling model development and benchmarking.

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

### [2] [Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161)
*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BF-PIP is a zero-shot method for pedestrian intention prediction using continuous video clips and contextual metadata, outperforming GPT-4V by 18% without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian intention prediction is critical for autonomous driving, but current methods require extensive retraining for new scenarios.

Method: BF-PIP uses continuous video clips with JAAD metadata and multimodal prompts (bounding-box annotations, ego-vehicle speed) for zero-shot prediction.

Result: Achieves 73% accuracy, 18% higher than GPT-4V, showing improved spatiotemporal perception.

Conclusion: Combining temporal inputs with contextual cues enhances intent inference, enabling agile, retraining-free perception for intelligent transportation.

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

### [3] [ChartM$^3$: Benchmarking Chart Editing with Multimodal Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21167)
*Danglu Yang,Liang Zhang,Zihao Yue,Liangyu Chen,Yichen Xu,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartM3, a multimodal benchmark for chart editing, combining natural language and visual indicators to improve precision. It reveals limitations in current MLLMs and proposes a training set to enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart editing methods rely on ambiguous natural language instructions, lacking support for fine-grained edits. A multimodal approach is needed for clearer intent expression.

Method: Introduces ChartM3, a benchmark with 1,000 samples of varying difficulty, combining charts, code, and multimodal instructions. It also creates ChartM3-Train, a 24,000-sample training set for fine-tuning MLLMs.

Result: Current MLLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with visual indicators. Fine-tuning on ChartM3-Train significantly improves performance, highlighting the need for multimodal supervision.

Conclusion: Multimodal supervision is crucial for practical chart editing systems. ChartM3 provides a robust benchmark and training set to advance the field.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

### [4] [PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21200)
*Soren Pedersen,Sanyam Jain,Mikkel Chavez,Viktor Ladehoff,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GAN for dental radiographs was developed to tackle data scarcity, using WGANGP on 2322 images. Models varied in critic iterations, feature depth, and denoising, with trade-offs in detail vs. clarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of data in dental research and education by generating synthetic panoramic radiographs.

Method: Trained a DCGAN with WGANGP on 2322 radiographs, focusing on dentoalveolar regions. Preprocessing and four model variations were tested.

Result: Generated images showed moderate anatomical depiction, with trade-offs: non-denoised models had finer details, while denoised models offered better clarity.

Conclusion: The study lays groundwork for future GAN applications in dental imaging, highlighting trade-offs between detail and image quality.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [5] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) is proposed to explain how DNNs integrate multimodal information for image captioning, offering interpretable insights beyond standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics for evaluating DNNs in image captioning lack deep insights into how models integrate visual, language, and knowledge information.

Method: The framework learns a HMLN distribution over training instances and infers distribution shifts when conditioning on generated captions, identifying influential examples.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art captioning models demonstrate the interpretability of the explanations and enable model comparison based on explainability.

Conclusion: The HMLN-based framework provides a transparent and interpretable way to understand and compare DNNs in multimodal tasks like image captioning.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

### [6] [Dual Guidance Semi-Supervised Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21247)
*Ankit Singh,Efstratios Gavves,Cees G. M. Snoek,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised learning approach for spatial-temporal action localization using a dual guidance network to improve pseudo-bounding box selection, outperforming image-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL is underutilized in spatial-temporal action localization despite its potential to reduce annotation dependency.

Method: Introduces a dual guidance network combining frame-level classification and bounding-box prediction for action class consistency.

Result: Significantly improves performance on UCF101-24, J-HMDB-21, and AVA datasets in limited labeled data settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework is effective for semi-supervised spatial-temporal action localization, surpassing image-based SSL methods.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

### [7] [Tracking Moose using Aerial Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21256)
*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores patching augmentation for small object detection in aerial wildlife tracking, comparing three object detectors. Results show high accuracy (≥93% mAP) and suggest simpler models are effective for UAV deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial wildlife tracking faces challenges like cost, risk, and computational limits. Small object detection is difficult due to tiny object sizes and efficiency needs.

Method: Applies patching augmentation to datasets and compares three object detectors, varying hyperparameters to study detection accuracy.

Result: All models achieved ≥93% mAP@IoU=0.5 in some configurations. Simpler models performed comparably to complex ones, suitable for UAVs.

Conclusion: Patching augmentation improves small object detection. Simpler models are viable for UAV deployment, balancing accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [8] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach using Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for HDR environment map estimation from single-view images, addressing ERP distortions and seams with ERP convolutional padding and a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer (PanoDiT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve HDR environment map estimation by addressing distortions and seams in ERP representations, enhancing quality and plausibility for mirror-reflective surfaces.

Method: Proposes ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder to remove border seams and introduces PanoDiT, a panoramically-adapted Diffusion Transformer, to reduce ERP distortions.

Result: Models produce high-quality environment maps, competitive with state-of-the-art in image quality and lighting accuracy, though PanoDiT trades some image quality for reduced distortions.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses ERP issues and advances single-view HDR environment map estimation, balancing quality and accuracy.

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

### [9] [Fairness and Robustness of CLIP-Based Models for Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21291)
*Théo Sourget,David Restrepo,Céline Hudelot,Enzo Ferrante,Stergios Christodoulidis,Maria Vakalopoulou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates six CLIP-based models for chest X-ray classification, focusing on fairness and robustness across patient subgroups and clinical conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the fairness and robustness of CLIP-based models in medical tasks, particularly radiology, where performance gaps and reliance on spurious correlations are underexplored.

Method: Evaluation of six CLIP-based models on three datasets (MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, NEATX) for fairness across age, sex, race, and robustness to shortcut learning in pneumothorax cases.

Result: Performance gaps exist for age, but equitable results for sex and race. Models perform worse without chest drains, indicating reliance on spurious correlations. Embeddings reveal sensitive attribute classification but not with PCA.

Conclusion: CLIP-based models show fairness issues for age and shortcut learning, highlighting the need for further research to improve robustness and fairness in medical applications.

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

### [10] [VoluMe -- Authentic 3D Video Calls from Live Gaussian Splat Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21311)
*Martin de La Gorce,Charlie Hewitt,Tibor Takacs,Robert Gerdisch,Zafiirah Hosenie,Givi Meishvili,Marek Kowalski,Thomas J. Cashman,Antonio Criminisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for real-time 3D Gaussian reconstructions from a single 2D webcam feed, enhancing remote meetings with realistic and authentic 3D representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving remote meetings by addressing the challenges of 3D representation in virtual meetings, which often require complex hardware or fixed appearances.

Method: Predicts 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed, ensuring authenticity and realism by conditioning on each video frame independently and introducing a stability loss for temporal consistency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and stability, enabling live 3D meetings with standard 2D cameras and displays.

Conclusion: The method provides a highly accessible, realistic, and authentic solution for 3D videoconferencing, democratizing volumetric communication.

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

### [11] [GLCP: Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation for Tubular Structure Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21328)
*Feixiang Zhou,Zhuangzhi Gao,He Zhao,Jianyang Xie,Yanda Meng,Yitian Zhao,Gregory Y. H. Lip,Yalin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework for accurate tubular structure segmentation, addressing fragmentation by jointly learning global and local features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structural fragmentation in tubular segmentation hinders downstream applications; existing methods neglect local discontinuities.

Method: GLCP includes an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation module for global and local learning and a Dual-Attention-based Refinement module for quality improvement.

Result: GLCP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and continuity on 2D and 3D datasets.

Conclusion: The GLCP framework effectively addresses fragmentation by integrating global and local structural insights, enhancing segmentation quality.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at
https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

### [12] [Analyzing the Sensitivity of Vision Language Models in Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21335)
*Monika Shah,Sudarshan Balaji,Somdeb Sarkhel,Sanorita Dey,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how Vision Language Models (VLMs) handle violations of Grice's conversational maxims, finding their performance declines with added modifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if VLMs can process conversational violations like humans, using Grice's maxims as a framework.

Method: Modifiers were added to human-crafted questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset, tested on GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-Flash.

Result: VLMs' performance consistently diminished with modifiers, highlighting limitations.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for uncovering VLM limitations in handling conversational violations.

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

### [13] [Enhancing and Accelerating Brain MRI through Deep Learning Reconstruction Using Prior Subject-Specific Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21349)
*Amirmohammad Shamaei,Alexander Stebner,Salome,Bosshart,Johanna Ospel,Gouri Ginde,Mariana Bento,Roberto Souza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework improves scan quality and reduces time by integrating prior scans, validated on a dataset of 2,808 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long MRI acquisition times increase costs and reduce patient comfort; prior scans can enhance reconstruction but require time-consuming registration.

Method: Proposes a framework with an initial reconstruction network, deep registration model, and transformer-based enhancement network, tested on T1-weighted MRI scans.

Result: Outperforms existing methods (p < 0.05), improves brain segmentation accuracy, and reduces reconstruction time significantly.

Conclusion: The method is efficient for real-time clinical use, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

TL;DR: Efficient adaptation of Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using few examples, addressing overfitting and granularity mismatch with parameter-efficient tuning and feature augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in adapting VLMs for action detection include overfitting and scene-level vs. person-centric granularity mismatch.

Method: Combines LoRA for parameter-efficient tuning with learnable internal feature augmentation (FiLM) and a group-weighted loss function.

Result: Achieves strong mAP on AVA and MOMA datasets, demonstrating data efficiency with limited examples.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively adapts VLMs for action detection, balancing robustness and efficiency.

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

*Jicheng Yuan,Manh Nguyen Duc,Qian Liu,Manfred Hauswirth,Danh Le Phuoc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoP, a multi-task learning framework for BEV 3D object detection, leveraging spatial occupancy to improve environmental context understanding and feature refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing BEV methods neglect intrinsic environmental contexts like roads and pavements, limiting comprehensive perception. CoP addresses this by integrating occupancy prediction.

Method: CoP uses a pipeline for dense occupancy ground truths (LDO), voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS), and a global-local feature fusion (CFF) module to enhance BEV representations.

Result: CoP achieves 49.5% mAP and 59.2% NDS on the nuScenes benchmark, outperforming existing vision-based methods.

Conclusion: CoP effectively bridges gaps in spatial representation and feature refinement, demonstrating superior performance in BEV 3D object detection.

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

TL;DR: The paper compares deep learning models for classifying African wildlife images, finding ViT-H/14 most accurate but computationally costly, while DenseNet-201 offers a deployable balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the decline of African wildlife by leveraging deep learning for efficient biodiversity monitoring.

Method: Comparative study of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and ViT-H/14 on a dataset of four species, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors.

Result: ViT-H/14 achieved 99% accuracy but high computational cost; DenseNet-201 (67% accuracy) was deployed for practical use.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into model selection and deployment for wildlife conservation, emphasizing practicality.

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and
responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

*I-Hsiang Chen,Hua-En Chang,Wei-Ting Chen,Jenq-Neng Hwang,Sy-Yen Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDAF introduces a Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework to enhance domain generalization in semantic segmentation by modeling latent domain priors and iteratively refining feature representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in unseen environments degrade model performance, and existing methods often ignore intrinsic latent domain priors, leading to suboptimal results.

Method: PDAF uses a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts, integrating three modules: Latent Prior Extractor (LPE), Domain Compensation Module (DCM), and Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE). It leverages probabilistic diffusion modeling and paired/pseudo-target images for alignment.

Result: PDAF effectively enhances generalization under complex target conditions, validated by extensive experiments in diverse urban scenes.

Conclusion: PDAF advances DGSS by modeling domain shifts iteratively and refining features, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

TL;DR: Top2Pano generates realistic 360° indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views using volumetric occupancy estimation and diffusion-based refinement, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task is challenging due to missing 3D structure and the need for geometric consistency and photorealism, with applications in VR, design, real estate, and robotics.

Method: Top2Pano estimates volumetric occupancy for 3D structure, uses volumetric rendering for coarse panoramas, and refines them with ControlNet-based diffusion.

Result: Top2Pano outperforms baselines, reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial arrangements effectively, and generalizes well to schematic floorplans.

Conclusion: Top2Pano bridges top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis, showing strong potential in various applications.

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward is an efficient reward model for evaluating text-to-image generations using pretrained MLLMs, enhanced by a SkipCA module for better text-image correlation. It supports diverse preference data and outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLM-based approaches for evaluating T2I generations are time-consuming and require instruction-following data. LLaVA-Reward aims to simplify this by leveraging hidden states of MLLMs and improving bidirectional interaction.

Method: LLaVA-Reward uses hidden states of MLLMs for text-image pairs and introduces a SkipCA module to enhance visual-textual interaction. It supports paired and unpaired preference data for fine-tuning across four evaluation perspectives.

Result: LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based methods in generating human-aligned scores and inference-time scaling for T2I evaluations.

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward provides an efficient, scalable solution for automatic evaluation of T2I generations, improving upon existing methods in accuracy and flexibility.

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

*Chaoyu Li,Yogesh Kulkarni,Pooyan Fazli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReGATE is an adaptive token pruning method for accelerating MLLM training by selectively processing crucial tokens, reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is computationally expensive due to token volume, and existing efficiency methods focus on inference, offering limited training benefits.

Method: ReGATE uses a teacher-student framework with a frozen reference LLM (teacher) to compute per-token reference losses, combined with the student's difficulty scores for adaptive token pruning.

Result: ReGATE accelerates training by up to 2x, uses only 35% of tokens, and surpasses baseline performance on benchmarks while reducing token count by over 41%.

Conclusion: ReGATE effectively reduces computational overhead in MLLM training without sacrificing accuracy, outperforming standard methods.

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

*Thomas Monninger,Zihan Zhang,Zhipeng Mo,Md Zafar Anwar,Steffen Staab,Sihao Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapDiffusion introduces a generative approach using diffusion models to predict multiple plausible vectorized maps, improving accuracy and uncertainty estimation in autonomous driving environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional map construction models provide deterministic outputs, lacking uncertainty capture for real-world ambiguities like occlusions and missing lane markings.

Method: MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries conditioned on a BEV latent grid to generate diverse map samples, leveraging the diffusion paradigm.

Result: Outperforms baselines by 5% in single-sample performance on nuScenes, with aggregated samples improving accuracy and uncertainty estimates correlating with scene ambiguity.

Conclusion: MapDiffusion enhances robustness and reliability in HD map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

*Han Wu,Chong Wang,Zhiming Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new semi-supervised learning framework, DuCiSC, improves medical image segmentation by enforcing region-level semantic consistency and addressing feature discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods overlook semantic consistency and suffer from feature discrepancies due to imbalanced labeled and unlabeled data.

Method: DuCiSC introduces dual paradigms for region-level consistency and a self-aware confidence estimation strategy for reliable pseudo-labeling.

Result: DuCiSC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: DuCiSC effectively addresses limitations of current approaches and achieves superior segmentation performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

*Bolei Chen,Jiaxu Kang,Yifei Wang,Ping Zhong,Qi Wu,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a navigation policy for Vision Language Navigation (VLN) using Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) and Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) to improve scene representation and alignment with commands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLN agents struggle with overly detailed scene representation and poor vision-language alignment, leading to navigation errors.

Method: The method involves RVI for summarizing visual perceptions and ALG for aligning situational memories with linguistic commands.

Result: The proposed policy outperforms state-of-the-art methods on VLN-CE and ObjectNav tasks.

Conclusion: RVI and ALG techniques enhance VLN by improving scene comprehension and linguistic grounding.

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, a method to create compact sets of exemplars from self-supervisedly trained representations, enhancing cross-architecture generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of dataset sizes increases training costs, making dataset distillation essential for reducing computational expenses while maintaining model performance.

Method: Proposes novel techniques: 1) low-dimensional bases for parameterizing images and representations, 2) predetermined augmentations to address instability, and 3) a lightweight network to model connections among augmented views.

Result: The method shows superior distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer learning performance in experiments.

Conclusion: Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation effectively preserves key dataset characteristics compactly, offering a scalable solution for reducing training costs.

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

*Mianzhao Wang,Fan Shi,Xu Cheng,Feifei Zhang,Shengyong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel light field representation (ESI) and an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for improved object tracking in low-light scenes, validated by a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with reliable angular modeling in temporal domains, especially in low-light scenes, necessitating better representation and tracking solutions.

Method: Proposes ESI for geometric structure in light fields and ATINet for angular-temporal interaction learning, with self-supervised optimization.

Result: ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking and shows promise in multiple object tracking.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance light field modeling and tracking, particularly in challenging low-light conditions.

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

TL;DR: DAC framework leverages CLIP and MLLM for open-set 3D object retrieval, achieving superior performance with multi-view images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with generalized representations due to limited 3D training data. CLIP's pre-trained capabilities offer a solution.

Method: DAC combines CLIP with MLLM for adaptation and inference, using AB-LoRA to enhance generalization.

Result: DAC outperforms prior methods by +10.01% mAP on four datasets and shows strong generalization.

Conclusion: DAC is a simple yet effective solution for open-set 3DOR, validated across diverse setups.

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces VAGU, a benchmark for Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) that combines anomaly grounding and understanding, along with a training-free framework (GtS) and a new metric (JeAUG).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VAD methods lack integration of anomaly understanding and grounding, limiting comprehensive detection.

Method: Proposes VAGU benchmark with annotations for anomaly category, explanation, temporal grounding, and Video QA. Introduces GtS framework for coarse localization and refinement, and JeAUG metric for joint evaluation.

Result: Experiments confirm the effectiveness of VAGU, GtS, and JeAUG in improving VAD performance.

Conclusion: The work bridges the gap in VAD by unifying grounding and understanding, offering a robust benchmark and framework.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient sampling for large-scale vision-language models in AL.

Method: Introduces a differentiable loss function for uncertainty calibration within AL, comparing Prompt learning and LoRA for sample selection.

Result: Matches/exceeds performance of complex feature-based sampling techniques with higher computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method is effective for AL in vision-language models, offering a balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative

*Mengling Xu,Ming Tao,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Cooking, a model for cooking process visualization, addressing challenges like semantic inconsistency and contextual coherence. It uses Dynamic Patch Selection, Semantic Evolution, and Bidirectional CoT Guidance, validated on the CookViz dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on finished food images, lacking solutions for visualizing intermediate cooking steps with semantic consistency and coherence.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Patch Selection for ingredient appearance, Semantic Evolution for text association, and Bidirectional CoT Guidance for coherence.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in generating coherent and semantically consistent cooking process images.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking effectively addresses the challenges of cooking process visualization, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

### [30] [Suppressing Gradient Conflict for Generalizable Deepfake Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21530)
*Ming-Hui Liu,Harry Cheng,Xin Luo,Xin-Shun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CS-DFD, a framework to mitigate gradient conflicts in deepfake detection, improving generalization by reconciling disparities between original and synthesized forgeries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection models degrade when trained on both original and synthesized data due to gradient conflicts, contradicting the belief that more data enhances accuracy.

Method: Proposes CS-DFD with two modules: UVS for reconciling gradient disparities and CGR for enforcing low-conflict feature embeddings.

Result: CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in in-domain accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses gradient conflicts, enhancing deepfake detection robustness.

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms, highlighting research gaps and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sun sensors are critical for spacecraft attitude determination, but their calibration is complex due to spatio-temporal uncertainties. Existing literature lacks consolidation, necessitating a systematic review.

Method: The paper conducts a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling and calibration algorithms, surveying methodologies and analyzing gaps.

Result: A comprehensive survey of methodologies is provided, along with identified research gaps and recommendations for future work.

Conclusion: The review consolidates existing knowledge on sun sensor calibration, offering insights for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack sufficient global information for high-precision 3D anomaly detection.

Method: Converts high-resolution point clouds into multi-view images and uses a reconstruction-based framework.

Result: Achieves 89.6% object-wise AU-ROC and 95.7% point-wise AU-ROC on Real3D-AD.

Conclusion: MVR effectively enhances global information learning for 3D anomaly detection.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection is critical in industrial quality inspection. While
existing methods achieve notable progress, their performance degrades in
high-precision 3D anomaly detection due to insufficient global information. To
address this, we propose Multi-View Reconstruction (MVR), a method that
losslessly converts high-resolution point clouds into multi-view images and
employs a reconstruction-based anomaly detection framework to enhance global
information learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
MVR, achieving 89.6\% object-wise AU-ROC and 95.7\% point-wise AU-ROC on the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RelMap is a transformer-based framework for online HD map construction that improves accuracy by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based methods for online HD map construction often ignore spatial and semantic relationships among map elements, limiting accuracy and generalization.

Method: RelMap introduces a Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior for positional dependencies and a Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior for feature refinement, compatible with single-frame and temporal backbones.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets.

Conclusion: RelMap effectively enhances online HD map construction by leveraging spatial and semantic relationships, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

*Maxim Henry,Adrien Deliège,Anthony Cioppa,Marc Van Droogenbroeck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinDeps is a post-pruning method for CNNs that uses linear dependency analysis to remove redundant filters, improving compression rates without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of optimally pruning CNNs without degrading performance, especially by considering structural dependencies often overlooked by existing methods.

Method: LinDeps applies pivoted QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent filters, followed by a signal recovery mechanism to adjust kernels without fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet show improved compression rates and preserved performance, even in low-resource setups.

Conclusion: LinDeps is a versatile and effective add-on for any pruning technique, advancing the state of the art in CNN pruning.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

### [35] [TARS: MinMax Token-Adaptive Preference Strategy for Hallucination Reduction in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21584)
*Kejia Zhang,Keda Tao,Zhiming Luo,Chang Liu,Jiasheng Tang,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS, a token-adaptive preference strategy, improves multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by reducing hallucinations through dynamic alignment with human preferences, outperforming standard DPO and matching GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce factually incorrect or visually ungrounded outputs, reducing reliability. Current DPO strategies overfit to superficial cues, impairing grounding.

Method: TARS reformulates DPO as a min-max optimization problem, maximizing token-level distributional shifts under semantic constraints to simulate uncertainty and minimize preference loss.

Result: TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and cognition value from 2.5 to 0.4, outperforming standard DPO and matching GPT-4o.

Conclusion: TARS effectively mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs by preserving causal grounding and avoiding overfitting, demonstrating strong performance with minimal data.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Motivation: To address the gap in updated and comprehensive reviews of WSSS with image-level labels, given rapid developments and limitations of existing surveys.

Method: Synthesizes latest advancements and state-of-the-art techniques, categorizing methods by supervision types and levels, and examines domain-specific challenges.

Result: Provides a detailed overview of current WSSS methods, their limitations, and underexplored topics like domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: Highlights current challenges, evaluates limitations, and outlines future research directions for WSSS with image-level labels, targeting researchers familiar with WSSS fundamentals.

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

*Lais Isabelle Alves dos Santos,Julien Despois,Thibaut Chauffier,Sileye O. Ba,Giovanni Palma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel face aging method using latent diffusion models to selectively age facial regions, addressing heterogeneity in aging for more realistic results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods treat aging as a homogeneous process, ignoring regional differences due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

Method: Leverages latent diffusion models to age specific facial regions locally, using a refiner for seamless blending.

Result: Achieves robust identity preservation, high-fidelity imagery, and natural aging progression.

Conclusion: The method provides finer-grained control and more realistic face aging compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised tracking framework (SSTrack) eliminates box annotations by using spatio-temporal consistency and instance contrastive loss, outperforming SOTA methods by up to 25.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual box annotations are labor-intensive, limiting dataset scale and diversity. SSTrack aims to reduce reliance on such annotations.

Method: Uses decoupled spatio-temporal consistency for global-local learning and instance contrastive loss for robust instance supervision without labels.

Result: Achieves improvements of 25.3%, 20.4%, and 14.8% in AUC scores on GOT10K, LaSOT, and TrackingNet datasets.

Conclusion: SSTrack effectively learns tracking representations self-supervised, reducing annotation dependency while outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that larger, generalized models always perform better in medical image segmentation, especially for tasks with subtle boundaries.

Method: Used a carefully configured DeepLabv3 model for segmenting iPS cell colonies, comparing it against SAM2 and MedSAM2.

Result: DeepLabv3 achieved higher performance without structural modifications, outperforming the larger models.

Conclusion: Simpler, domain-specific models can offer better accuracy and reliability for specialized biomedical tasks, and an open-source implementation is provided to support further research.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

TL;DR: Proposes synthetic data generation for training drones to inspect wind turbine blades, improving diversity and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of manually labeled real-world images by generating diverse synthetic training data.

Method: Generate synthetic WT images with controlled variations and train YOLOv11 with a modified loss function.

Result: Achieves high performance (Pose mAP50-95 of 0.97) on real-world images unseen during training.

Conclusion: Synthetic data enhances training diversity and improves detection accuracy for autonomous drone inspections.

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

TL;DR: EMIT enhances MLLMs for industrial anomaly detection (IAD) via difficulty-aware GRPO, achieving a 7.77% performance boost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack domain-specific adaptation for IAD, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: EMIT uses GPT-generated descriptions, soft prompts, heatmap-guided embeddings, and difficulty-aware GRPO with response resampling and advantage reweighting.

Result: EMIT improves IAD performance by 7.77% on the MMAD benchmark.

Conclusion: EMIT effectively adapts MLLMs for IAD, addressing domain-specific challenges.

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GuidPaint is a training-free, class-guided diffusion model for image inpainting, improving semantic consistency and visual realism without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based inpainting methods lack fine-grained control over masked regions, leading to inconsistent or implausible results.

Method: GuidPaint incorporates classifier guidance into denoising, enabling precise control and integrating stochastic and deterministic sampling.

Result: GuidPaint outperforms existing methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: GuidPaint offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for high-quality image inpainting.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

### [45] [APT: Improving Diffusion Models for High Resolution Image Generation with Adaptive Path Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21690)
*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT improves high-resolution image generation by addressing patch-level issues in LDMs, offering faster and clearer results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-resolution LDMs struggle with high-resolution images, and training-based solutions are impractical due to resource demands. Patch-based methods have limitations like distribution shift and monotonicity.

Method: APT uses Statistical Matching and Scale-aware Scheduling to address patch issues, enabling faster and clearer high-resolution generation.

Result: APT produces more detailed images with improved speed and minimal quality loss.

Conclusion: APT is a practical solution for high-resolution image generation, outperforming existing patch-based methods.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

*Yuan Tian,Shuo Wang,Rongzhao Zhang,Zijian Chen,Yankai Jiang,Chunyi Li,Xiangyang Zhu,Fang Yan,Qiang Hu,XiaoSong Wang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for medical image de-identification balances privacy and semantics by blocking identity regions and compensating with medical features, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy risks in medical imaging while preserving diagnostic utility, as current de-identification methods lack flexibility and semantic retention.

Method: A two-step framework: (1) Identity-Blocking for adjustable privacy levels, and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation using pre-trained models, with feature decoupling to remove residual identity.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across seven datasets and three tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively balances privacy and medical utility, offering a flexible and superior solution for de-identification.

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as metrics for evaluating underwater image enhancement, proposing a novel framework to assess enhancement techniques' impact on frame-matching performance and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater image enhancement is crucial for tasks like path detection and autonomous navigation, but existing methods lack robust evaluation metrics for real-world performance.

Method: The authors propose a novel evaluation framework using local matching stability and furthest matchable frame to analyze enhancement techniques' impact on frame-matching.

Result: The framework identifies strengths and limitations of existing approaches and demonstrates its relevance through improved performance in SLAM algorithms.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a context-aware benchmark for comparing underwater image enhancement methods, bridging gaps in real-world applicability assessment.

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

*Nils Hütten,Florian Hölken,Hasan Tercan,Tobias Meisen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper systematically analyzes the impact of ablating key components in detection transformer models (DETR, DDETR, DINO) to understand their roles, revealing model-specific resilience patterns and structural redundancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance interpretability and transparency in complex models like detection transformers by understanding the distinct roles of internal components, inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies.

Method: Ablation studies targeting query embeddings, encoder/decoder MHSA, and decoder MHCA layers in DETR, DDETR, and DINO models, evaluated on COCO dataset using gIoU and F1-score.

Result: Model-specific resilience patterns: DETR is sensitive to encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA ablations, DDETR is robust due to multi-scale deformable attention, and DINO is most resilient due to its update rule. Structural redundancies in DDETR and DINO decoder MHCA layers were identified.

Conclusion: The study clarifies internal component contributions in DETRs, offering insights for optimizing transparency and efficiency, and releases the DeepDissect library for reproducibility.

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

### [49] [SAMITE: Position Prompted SAM2 with Calibrated Memory for Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732)
*Qianxiong Xu,Lanyun Zhu,Chenxi Liu,Guosheng Lin,Cheng Long,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMITE improves Visual Object Tracking (VOT) by addressing occlusion and distraction issues using a Prototypical Memory Bank and Positional Prompt Generator, built on SAM2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VOT methods lack temporal dependencies or generalize poorly to unseen classes, and struggle with occlusions and distractions.

Method: SAMITE enhances SAM2 with a Prototypical Memory Bank to filter inaccurate frames and a Positional Prompt Generator for explicit positional clues.

Result: SAMITE outperforms existing methods on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: SAMITE effectively tackles occlusion and distraction challenges in VOT, improving accuracy and generalizability.

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at

*Shaojun E,Yuchen Yang,Jiaheng Wu,Yan Zhang,Tiejun Zhao,Ziyan Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MAGE, a multimodal framework for aligning vision and text, enhancing performance via Intelligent Alignment Network and a novel training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spatial and semantic losses in visual data encoding, improving coupling between visual encoders and language models.

Method: Uses Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN) for dimensional and semantic alignment, combining cross-entropy and mean squared error for training.

Result: Achieves superior performance on benchmarks like MME, MMBench, and SEED.

Conclusion: MAGE effectively bridges vision-text semantic gaps, enhancing multimodal model performance.

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

### [51] [Adversarial Reconstruction Feedback for Robust Fine-grained Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21742)
*Shijie Wang,Jian Shi,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRF is a novel adversarial reconstruction feedback framework for fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) that learns category-agnostic discrepancy representations, improving generalization to unseen categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGIR methods rely on predefined categories, introducing semantic dependencies that hinder generalization. AdvRF aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: AdvRF combines category-aware discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature learning from reconstruction models, using adversarial feedback and knowledge distillation.

Result: AdvRF achieves strong performance on fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets, demonstrating improved generalization.

Conclusion: AdvRF effectively learns category-agnostic representations, enhancing FGIR performance and generalization to unseen categories.

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

*Aybora Koksal,A. Aydin Alatan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot reinforcement learning framework (RLVR) for satellite imagery eliminates the need for caption supervision, using rule-based rewards. It achieves strong performance with minimal annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized domains like remote sensing lack annotated data, making large models impractical. RLVR addresses this by reducing reliance on expensive supervision.

Method: Uses policy-gradient optimization with as few as one curated example, adapting the 1-shot RLVR paradigm from language to vision-language models.

Result: Achieves substantial improvements with one example; scaling to 128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of samples.

Conclusion: RLVR enables cost-effective, data-efficient development of domain-specialist models, offering a practical solution for data-scarce fields.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteFat is a lightweight spatio-temporal graph learning model for efficient driver fatigue detection, reducing computational demands while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driver fatigue is a major cause of accidents, but existing deep learning solutions are too resource-intensive for embedded devices.

Method: Converts video data into spatio-temporal graphs using facial landmarks, employs MobileNet for feature extraction, and uses a lightweight graph neural network for fatigue detection.

Result: LiteFat achieves competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity and latency compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Enables real-time, resource-efficient fatigue detection for embedded devices like intelligent vehicles.

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

TL;DR: MoR-ViT introduces a token-level dynamic recursion mechanism for Vision Transformers, reducing parameters by 70% and accelerating inference by 2.5x while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ViTs suffer from parameter redundancy and high computational costs, limiting practical deployment. Existing methods focus on static compression or token sparsification but lack flexibility in computational depth.

Method: MoR-ViT uses a Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR) paradigm to enable adaptive processing depth for each token, dynamically allocating computational resources.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet-1K and transfer benchmarks with significant parameter reduction and inference speedup, outperforming DynamicViT and TinyViT.

Conclusion: Dynamic recursion is an effective strategy for efficient ViTs, offering scalability and deployability for real-world applications.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AU-LLM is a novel framework using LLMs for micro-expression AU detection, addressing the vision-language gap with an Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP). It achieves state-of-the-art results on CASME II and SAMM datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expression AU detection is challenging but crucial for understanding subtle emotions. LLMs' potential in this fine-grained, low-intensity domain is unexplored.

Method: AU-LLM employs an EFP to fuse mid-level and high-level visual features into a dense token, enabling LLMs to reason over subtle facial movements.

Result: AU-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art on CASME II and SAMM datasets under LOSO and cross-domain protocols.

Conclusion: LLM-based reasoning shows significant potential for robust micro-expression analysis, validated by AU-LLM's performance.

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

TL;DR: MSGCoOp enhances few-shot generalization in VLMs by using parallel context vectors and semantic guidance from LLMs, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt learning methods struggle with generalization to novel classes and often introduce complexity or inefficiency.

Method: MSGCoOp uses parallel learnable context vectors, semantic guidance from LLMs, and diversity regularization to capture diverse semantics.

Result: Achieves 1.10% average improvement in harmonic mean over KgCoOp and shows robustness in cross-domain tasks.

Conclusion: MSGCoOp effectively balances generalization and computational efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with variability and ambiguity in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced clinical information.

Method: Uses structured text reports from an LLM to augment image data, focusing on Chest X-Rays, and models inter- and intra-modal uncertainty.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks by improving representations.

Conclusion: The framework enhances medical image-text pre-training by addressing ambiguity and leveraging clinical context.

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

TL;DR: HunyuanWorld 1.0 is a novel framework for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D scenes from text and image inputs, combining the strengths of video-based and 3D-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D world generation either lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency (video-based) or face limited training data and memory inefficiency (3D-based). HunyuanWorld 1.0 aims to bridge these gaps.

Method: The framework uses a semantically layered 3D mesh representation with panoramic world proxies for semantic-aware decomposition and reconstruction, enabling 360° immersive experiences, mesh export, and disentangled object representations.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and interactive 3D worlds, with applications in VR, physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0 successfully combines the advantages of existing approaches, offering a versatile and efficient solution for immersive 3D world generation.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,

### [59] [Anyone Can Jailbreak: Prompt-Based Attacks on LLMs and T2Is](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21820)
*Ahmed B Mustafa,Zihan Ye,Yang Lu,Michael P Pound,Shreyank N Gowda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates how non-experts bypass safety mechanisms in LLMs and T2I systems using clever prompts, proposing a taxonomy of jailbreak strategies and calling for context-aware defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and categorize the low-effort, high-impact jailbreak techniques used by everyday users to circumvent safety measures in AI systems.

Method: A systems-style investigation involving empirical case studies of prompt-based jailbreaks across popular APIs, analyzing techniques like multi-turn narrative escalation and lexical camouflage.

Result: Reveals that all stages of the moderation pipeline can be bypassed with accessible strategies, highlighting vulnerabilities in current defenses.

Conclusion: Urges the development of context-aware defenses to address the reproducibility of jailbreaks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

### [60] [Cross-Architecture Distillation Made Simple with Redundancy Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21844)
*Weijia Zhang,Yuehao Liu,Wu Ran,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation via redundancy suppression, outperforming OFA with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are inefficient due to complex designs and excessive parameters, limiting applicability.

Method: Proposes redundancy suppression distillation (RSD) loss with invariance maximization and feature decorrelation, plus a lightweight decoupling module.

Result: Outperforms OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: RSD is a simple, efficient baseline for cross-architecture distillation.

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

### [61] [Unleashing the Power of Motion and Depth: A Selective Fusion Strategy for RGB-D Video Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21857)
*Jiahao He,Daerji Suolang,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) is proposed for RGB-D VSOD, using pixel-level selective fusion and multi-dimensional attention to enhance feature representation, outperforming 19 state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-D VSOD models treat optical flow and depth equally, limiting their potential. The paper aims to address this by selectively fusing modalities based on their contributions.

Method: SMFNet employs a pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) and a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate optical flow, depth, and RGB features effectively.

Result: SMFNet outperforms 19 state-of-the-art models on RDVS and DVisal datasets and shows efficacy on synthetic depth datasets.

Conclusion: SMFNet's selective fusion and attention mechanisms significantly improve RGB-D VSOD performance, validated by comprehensive benchmarks.

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-TTA is a lightweight test-time adaptation framework for video editing, addressing temporal inconsistencies and prompt overfitting through self-supervised tasks, motion-aware reconstruction, and dynamic loss balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods struggle with temporal inconsistencies and prompt overfitting due to UNet limitations and lack of annotated data. Vid-TTA aims to enhance quality without high computational costs.

Method: Vid-TTA uses self-supervised auxiliary tasks, motion-aware frame reconstruction, and prompt perturbation with a meta-learning dynamic loss balancing mechanism.

Result: The framework improves temporal consistency, reduces prompt overfitting, and maintains low computational overhead.

Conclusion: Vid-TTA offers a plug-and-play solution to boost performance in existing video editing models.

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

*Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Dogucan Yaman,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-model framework improves embodied reference understanding by leveraging both head-to-fingertip and wrist-to-fingertip pointing directions, using Gaussian ray heatmaps and a CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multimodal integration (text, pointing, scene context) and oversimplify pointing direction assumptions.

Method: Proposes a dual-model framework with Gaussian ray heatmaps, a CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble, and an auxiliary object center prediction task.

Result: Achieves ~4 mAP improvement at 0.25 IoU on the YouRefIt dataset.

Conclusion: The dual-model approach and auxiliary tasks enhance referent localization by better leveraging pointing cues.

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

*Saeed Ghorbani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aether Weaver is a multimodal narrative co-generation framework that integrates text, visuals, and sound for immersive storytelling, outperforming sequential pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of sequential text-to-visual pipelines by enabling concurrent generation of narratives, visuals, and soundscapes.

Method: Uses a Narrator (LLM) for text and prompts, a Director for scene graphs, a Narrative Arc Controller for story structure, and an Affective Tone Mapper for emotional consistency.

Result: Qualitative evaluations show enhanced narrative depth, visual fidelity, and emotional resonance compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Aether Weaver offers a robust platform for creative prototyping and immersive storytelling.

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates modern deepfake detectors in real-world scenarios, finding them largely ineffective, with basic image manipulations further reducing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes pose a threat to digital media authenticity, but existing detectors lack real-world testing.

Method: A novel testing procedure and a dataset of 500,000 deepfake images were created using state-of-the-art generation methods.

Result: Fewer than half of detectors achieved an AUC score >60%, with basic manipulations like JPEG compression degrading performance.

Conclusion: Deepfake detection remains challenging, and current detectors struggle in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI in pathology can predict race from slides, revealing biases and the need for careful data curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if AI models in pathology can unintentionally learn racial biases from slides.

Method: Used deep learning with attention mechanisms on a racially diverse dataset, testing three curation strategies.

Result: Models predicted race with high AUC for White and Black groups (0.799, 0.762), but overall performance dropped to 0.663. Epidermis was a key feature.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for bias mitigation and careful data curation in AI for equitable pathology applications.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArtSeek is a multimodal framework for art analysis, combining large language models with retrieval-augmented generation, achieving state-of-the-art results in style classification and captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Digitized artworks require deep artistic and historical understanding, but existing methods often rely on external links (e.g., Wikidata). ArtSeek aims to analyze artworks using only image input, addressing gaps in current approaches.

Method: ArtSeek integrates multimodal retrieval, contrastive multitask classification, and agentic reasoning with Qwen2.5-VL. It uses WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset, for knowledge-grounded reasoning.

Result: Achieves +8.4% F1 in style classification over GraphCLIP and +7.1 BLEU@1 in captioning on ArtPedia. Can interpret motifs, infer context, and retrieve knowledge for obscure works.

Conclusion: ArtSeek generalizes beyond visual arts, supporting scalable multimodal AI research. Dataset and code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SwinECAT, a Transformer-based model combining Swin and ECA attention mechanisms, to improve fundus image analysis by addressing challenges like small lesions and subtle disease differences. It achieves high accuracy in 9-category classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fundus image analysis faces challenges like small lesion areas and subtle inter-disease differences, reducing model accuracy. The paper aims to enhance diagnosis granularity and performance.

Method: Proposes SwinECAT, integrating Swin Attention for spatial structures and ECA Attention for critical feature channels, tested on 16,140 fundus images for 9-category classification.

Result: SwinECAT achieves 88.29% accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90, outperforming baseline models.

Conclusion: SwinECAT sets a new benchmark for 9-category fundus disease classification, demonstrating superior performance and potential for clinical application.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

TL;DR: MMAT-1M is a million-scale multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to enhance Chain-of-Thought, reflection, and tool usage in multimodal LLMs, achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset for multimodal agent tuning limits the potential of multimodal LLMs.

Method: A four-stage data engine curates and refines multimodal question-answer pairs, integrating rationales, reflections, and dynamic tool usage via GPT-4o.

Result: Fine-tuning on MMAT-1M improves performance by 2.7% on average across benchmarks and 8.8% on Dyn-VQA.

Conclusion: MMAT-1M effectively enhances multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities, with the dataset publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is

*Xin Wang,Peng-Jie Li,Yuan-Yuan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMAC-Net improves long-term action quality assessment by aligning multimodal features and enhancing temporal dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AQA methods lack effective multimodal integration and temporal tracking, limiting performance in artistic sports evaluation.

Method: LMAC-Net uses a multimodal attention consistency mechanism, local query encoder, and two-level score evaluation for alignment and interpretability.

Result: LMAC-Net outperforms existing methods on RG and Fis-V datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed LMAC-Net effectively addresses multimodal and temporal challenges in long-term AQA.

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a mixup-class prompt strategy for data-free quantization (DFQ) to enhance synthetic data diversity and robustness, improving post-training quantization (PTQ) performance, especially in low-bit scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTQ struggles with limited calibration data under privacy constraints, and existing DFQ methods using single-class prompts suffer from polysemy and performance degradation.

Method: Proposes a mixup-based text prompting strategy (mixup-class prompt) to fuse multiple class labels for generating diverse synthetic data, enhancing PTQ generalization and stability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ, achieving new accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation (W2A4) quantization.

Conclusion: The mixup-class prompt strategy effectively improves synthetic data quality and PTQ performance, setting a new benchmark for low-bit quantization.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

*Jiyu Wu,Yifan Liu,Jiancheng Huang,Mingfu Yan,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes AGBA and FCFN for shadow removal without masks, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on shadow masks, which are hard to obtain. Intrinsic cues like contrast are ambiguous in complex scenes.

Method: AGBA dynamically filters contrast cues; FCFN uses diffusion and frequency-contrast fusion for detail restoration.

Result: State-of-the-art performance among mask-free methods, competitive with mask-based approaches.

Conclusion: AGBA and FCFN effectively address shadow removal challenges without masks, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

*Zheyuan Zhang,Yen-chia Hsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) framework is proposed to address the co-occurrence problem in industrial smoke detection without external supervision, using a teacher-student model with CNNs and ViTs and a knowledge transfer loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level labels are scarce, especially in domains like industrial smoke, where expert knowledge is required. Existing WSSS methods suffer from incomplete coverage and inaccurate boundaries due to supervision gaps and model biases.

Method: The framework employs a teacher-student model combining CNNs and ViTs, introduces a knowledge transfer loss for cross-architecture consistency, and uses post-processing to improve pseudo mask quality.

Result: The proposed method targets co-occurrence issues without external supervision, improving pseudo mask quality and addressing inherent model biases.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution to WSSS challenges in industrial smoke detection, mitigating co-occurrence problems and enhancing segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

*Jiahui Ren,Mochu Xiang,Jiajun Zhu,Yuchao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoSplatt3R is an unposed wide-baseline panorama reconstruction method that outperforms state-of-the-art methods without requiring precise pose information, excelling in novel view generation and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing panorama reconstruction methods rely heavily on accurate pose information, which is resource-intensive and noise-prone, limiting their practicality.

Method: PanoSplatt3R adapts reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective to the panoramic domain and introduces RoPE rolling for efficient domain-transfer, leveraging rotary positional embeddings to model panorama periodicity.

Result: PanoSplatt3R significantly outperforms current methods in novel view generation and depth estimation, even without pose information.

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R demonstrates strong generalization and practical potential, making it a viable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

*Xiaoyu Wang,Ramesh Nadarajah,Zhiqiang Zhang,David Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for classifying paper-like ECG images into five diagnostic categories, addressing visual noise and fine waveform detection, achieving high AUROC scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is crucial, and while ECGs are key, manual interpretation is time-consuming. Most ECG data are stored as images, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Proposes a pre-processing pipeline for noise reduction and a two-stage fine-tuning strategy using ConvNeXt architecture, trained on synthetic and external datasets before target dataset fine-tuning.

Result: Achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 (validation) and 0.9677 (test) in the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

*Zhijiang Li,Haoran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EIFNet is a multi-modal fusion network for event-based semantic segmentation, addressing challenges in feature extraction and fusion between event and frame-based data. It achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution but struggle with sparse, noisy event streams and fusion with dense image data.

Method: Proposes EIFNet with Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module (MARM), and Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets.

Conclusion: EIFNet effectively addresses challenges in event-based semantic segmentation, demonstrating robust performance.

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

*Jihao Gu,Kun Li,Fei Wang,Yanyan Wei,Zhiliang Wu,Hehe Fan,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) to improve Micro-Action Recognition by capturing subtle motion cues, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook subtle changes in Micro-Actions (MAs), limiting recognition accuracy. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: MMN includes Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation (MSM) for skeletal-level motion cues and Motion-guided Temporal Modulation (MTM) for frame-level motion patterns. A motion consistency learning strategy aggregates multi-scale features.

Result: MMN outperforms existing methods on Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets, demonstrating superior performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling subtle motion cues is crucial for accurate Micro-Action Recognition, as validated by MMN's success.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZIUM is a zero-shot intent-aware adversarial attack method for unlearned models, improving attack success rates and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on unlearned models struggle with aligning attacks to intent and high computational costs.

Method: Proposes ZIUM, a zero-shot intent-aware attack method that customizes target attack images without additional optimization.

Result: ZIUM achieves higher attack success rates and significantly reduces attack time for previously attacked concepts.

Conclusion: ZIUM effectively addresses challenges in adversarial attacks on unlearned models, offering intent-aware customization and efficiency.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

*Oliver J. Sutton,Qinghua Zhou,George Leete,Alexander N. Gorban,Ivan Y. Tyukin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New methods for staining (watermarking) and locking computer vision models to protect intellectual property, without fine-tuning or retraining, with provable guarantees and minimal performance impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To protect the intellectual property of computer vision model owners by embedding identifiable behavior (staining) and restricting usage (locking) without requiring model retraining.

Method: Directly modify a small number of model weights to embed stains or locks. Unlocking requires inserting a trigger patch into input images.

Result: Effective staining and locking with minimal performance impact on unlocked models, supported by experimental results.

Conclusion: The methods provide practical, provable solutions for protecting model IP without retraining, with demonstrated efficacy.

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaCLIP 2 improves CLIP training on worldwide web-scale data, outperforming English-only CLIP and mSigLIP in zero-shot tasks and multilingual benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in scaling CLIP training to non-English data and mitigating the 'curse of multilinguality' to enhance performance.

Method: Training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs with minimal changes to ensure mutual benefits from English and non-English data.

Result: MetaCLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses English-only CLIP by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7% in zero-shot ImageNet classification, and achieves SOTA on multilingual benchmarks.

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2 successfully generalizes CLIP training to multilingual data, improving performance without system-level changes.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

TL;DR: CEDANet integrates citizen-provided weak labels and adversarial feature alignment for industrial smoke segmentation, outperforming baselines and matching fully supervised models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High cost and scarcity of pixel-level annotations in industrial smoke segmentation hinder air-quality monitoring.

Method: CEDANet uses citizen votes to refine pseudo-labels and class-specific domain discriminators for feature alignment.

Result: Achieves F1-score of 0.414 and smoke-class IoU of 0.261, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Combining citizen science with weakly supervised domain adaptation offers a scalable, cost-efficient solution for environmental monitoring.

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

*Ziyun Dai,Xiaoqiang Li,Shaohua Zhang,Yuanchen Wu,Jide Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViHallu is a vision-centric framework to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs by improving visual-semantic alignment through visual variation images and tailored instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often produce text inconsistent with visual content (hallucinations), and existing text-centric methods fail in fine-grained scenarios.

Method: Uses visual variation images and constructed visual instructions to enhance fine-grained visual understanding and alignment.

Result: ViHallu improves fine-grained visual understanding and reduces hallucinations in LVLMs across benchmarks.

Conclusion: ViHallu effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves visual-semantic alignment, with a released dataset for further research.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

*Sajay Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense audio-visual models perform well in low-resource, multilingual settings, with dense token routing being critical for success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether dense AV models generalize to low-resource, multilingual, and noisy settings, unlike English-centric, caption-rich scenarios.

Method: Compared three contrastive objectives: global mean-pooled loss, dense max-mean token matcher, and a hybrid, using a multilingual subset of Project Vaani.

Result: Dense objective improved R@1 by 59% over global pooling, with better ranks and sharp zero-shot localization, even with a frozen vision backbone.

Conclusion: Dense token routing is decisive in low-resource settings, outperforming global methods, and works without fine-tuning vision backbones.

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel segmentation-based XAI method for point cloud classification is proposed, featuring a point-shifting mechanism for perturbations and generating human-interpretable saliency maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding AI decision-making in critical applications is crucial, especially for point cloud data classification, requiring explanations that are easily interpretable by humans.

Method: Uses point cloud segmentation models and a novel point-shifting mechanism to introduce perturbations, generating meaningful saliency maps for classification models.

Result: Produces more meaningful saliency maps compared to classical clustering methods, demonstrated through example inputs.

Conclusion: The method effectively generates human-interpretable explanations, enhancing trust and analysis of AI decisions in point cloud classification.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

*Honglin He,Yukai Ma,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Seeing-to-Experiencing (S2E) framework to enhance navigation foundation models by combining offline pre-training with reinforcement learning (RL), improving interactivity and safety in real-world urban navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current navigation foundation models trained on offline data lack the ability to reason about action consequences or adapt interactively, limiting their real-world applicability, especially in dynamic environments.

Method: S2E integrates pre-training on videos with RL post-training. It introduces Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching for stable learning and diverse motion patterns, and a Residual-Attention Module to retain pretrained knowledge while adapting to simulations. NavBench-GS, a new benchmark, evaluates model generalizability and safety.

Result: S2E mitigates diminishing returns from offline data scaling, demonstrating improved interactivity and safety. RL post-training outperforms supervised fine-tuning for robot learning.

Conclusion: Integrating interactive online experiences (RL) is crucial for scaling foundation models in robotics, as shown by S2E's success in enhancing navigation capabilities.

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-evaluate shallow backbones for FGFSL, challenging the preference for deeper networks.

Method: Propose LCN-4 with a location-aware feature clustering module, grid position encoding, and frequency domain location embedding.

Result: LCN-4 outperforms ConvNet-4 and matches ResNet12-based methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Shallow architectures like LCN-4 can achieve competitive performance in FGFSL.

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in dense 3D reconstruction and open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.

Conclusion: Ov3R marks progress toward real-time, semantics-aware Spatial AI with globally consistent geometry and fine-grained semantics.

Abstract: We present Ov3R, a novel framework for open-vocabulary semantic 3D
reconstruction from RGB video streams, designed to advance Spatial AI. The
system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both dense 3D reconstruction and
open-vocabulary 3D segmentation, marking a step forward toward real-time,
semantics-aware Spatial AI.

TL;DR: Proposes MetaLab, a method for few-shot image recognition using CIELab color space and collaborative neural networks, achieving high accuracy and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the technical gaps in few-shot image recognition compared to large-scale recognition.

Method: MetaLab combines LabNet for domain transformation and feature extraction, and LabGNN for mutual learning between lightness and color graphs.

Result: Achieves ~99% accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization with one-shot samples.

Conclusion: MetaLab approaches human recognition accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness for few-shot tasks.

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

### [89] [X-Omni: Reinforcement Learning Makes Discrete Autoregressive Image Generative Models Great Again](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22058)
*Zigang Geng,Yibing Wang,Yeyao Ma,Chen Li,Yongming Rao,Shuyang Gu,Zhao Zhong,Qinglin Lu,Han Hu,Xiaosong Zhang,Linus,Di Wang,Jie Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes X-Omni, a framework combining reinforcement learning with autoregressive modeling to improve image generation quality and integrate it with language generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive methods for image generation suffer from low fidelity and distortion. The paper aims to address these issues and unify image and language generation.

Method: X-Omni uses a semantic image tokenizer, a unified autoregressive model, and an offline diffusion decoder. Reinforcement learning mitigates artifacts.

Result: X-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation with a 7B language model, producing high-quality images and following instructions well.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning enhances autoregressive image generation, enabling seamless integration with language tasks.

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

*Nisarg A. Shah,Bardia Safaei,Shameema Sikder,S. Swaroop Vedula,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StepAL is an active learning framework for surgical video analysis, improving efficiency by selecting full videos for annotation and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AL methods are ineffective for surgical videos due to inter-step dependencies and lack of context in frame/clip selection.

Method: StepAL uses step-aware feature representation with pseudo-labels and entropy-weighted clustering to prioritize uncertain and diverse videos for annotation.

Result: StepAL outperforms existing AL methods on cataract surgery datasets, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labeled videos.

Conclusion: StepAL reduces annotation costs and improves efficiency in surgical video analysis for computer-assisted systems.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MOVE, a dataset for motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS), evaluates existing methods, and proposes a baseline approach (DMA) to address challenges in motion understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSVOS datasets and methods focus on static object categories, ignoring temporal dynamics, limiting their use in motion-centric scenarios.

Method: The authors introduce the MOVE dataset and evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods. They propose DMA, a Decoupled Motion Appearance Network, as a baseline.

Result: Current methods struggle with motion-guided FSVOS. DMA outperforms them, demonstrating strong few-shot motion understanding.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for future research in motion-guided FSVOS, highlighting the need for improved methods in this area.

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Symbiotic Epistemology and SynLang to enable transparent human-AI collaboration, fostering trust and ethical accountability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack transparency, hindering human oversight and collaboration. Post-hoc explanations often fail to achieve genuine partnership.

Method: Proposes Symbiotic Epistemology and SynLang, a formal protocol with TRACE and TRACE_FE mechanisms for structured reasoning and confidence calibration.

Result: Empirical validation shows AI adaptation to reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive intervention, enhancing human-AI collaboration.

Conclusion: SynLang and symbiotic epistemology enable transparent, ethical AI systems that enhance human intelligence and preserve agency in decision-making.

Abstract: Current AI systems rely on opaque reasoning processes that hinder human
oversight and collaborative potential. Conventional explainable AI approaches
offer post-hoc justifications and often fail to establish genuine symbiotic
collaboration. In this paper, the Symbiotic Epistemology is presented as a
philosophical foundation for human-AI cognitive partnerships. Unlike frameworks
that treat AI as a mere tool or replacement, symbiotic epistemology positions
AI as a reasoning partner, fostering calibrated trust by aligning human
confidence with AI reliability through explicit reasoning patterns and
confidence assessments. SynLang (Symbiotic Syntactic Language) is introduced as
a formal protocol for transparent human-AI collaboration. The framework is
empirically validated through actual human-AI dialogues demonstrating AI's
adaptation to structured reasoning protocols and successful metacognitive
intervention. The protocol defines two complementary mechanisms: TRACE for
high-level reasoning patterns and TRACE_FE for detailed factor explanations. It
also integrates confidence quantification, declarative control over AI
behavior, and context inheritance for multi-agent coordination. By structuring
communication and embedding confidence-calibrated transparency, SynLang,
together with symbiotic epistemology, enables AI systems that enhance human
intelligence, preserve human agency, and uphold ethical accountability in
collaborative decision-making. Through dual-level transparency, beginning with
high-level reasoning patterns and progressing to granular explanations, the
protocol facilitates rapid comprehension and supports thorough verification of
AI decision-making.

*Mark A. Kramer,Aanchal Mathur,Caroline E. Adams,Jason A. Walonoski*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs aid Synthea module development by reducing time/expertise, improving data quality, and enabling tasks like disease profile/module generation, evaluation, and refinement. Challenges include human oversight and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Synthea's synthetic health data generation by leveraging LLMs for faster, less expert-dependent, and higher-quality module development.

Method: Four LLM-supported tasks: disease profile generation, module creation, module evaluation, and refinement. Introduces progressive refinement for iterative improvement.

Result: LLMs show promise in aiding module development but require human oversight and validation to address potential inaccuracies.

Conclusion: Future research is needed to fully harness LLMs for synthetic data creation, emphasizing oversight and validation.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to assist in the
development of new disease modules for Synthea, an open-source synthetic health
data generator. Incorporating LLMs into the module development process has the
potential to reduce development time, reduce required expertise, expand model
diversity, and improve the overall quality of synthetic patient data. We
demonstrate four ways that LLMs can support Synthea module creation: generating
a disease profile, generating a disease module from a disease profile,
evaluating an existing Synthea module, and refining an existing module. We
introduce the concept of progressive refinement, which involves iteratively
evaluating the LLM-generated module by checking its syntactic correctness and
clinical accuracy, and then using that information to modify the module. While
the use of LLMs in this context shows promise, we also acknowledge the
challenges and limitations, such as the need for human oversight, the
importance of rigorous testing and validation, and the potential for
inaccuracies in LLM-generated content. The paper concludes with recommendations
for future research and development to fully realize the potential of LLM-aided
synthetic data creation.

*Jae Wan Shim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task-agnostic method to analyze LLMs' internal processing by creating 'Cognitive Profiles' based on Entropy Decay Curves and an IGS index, revealing consistent patterns tied to model scale and text complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond task-specific benchmarks and understand how LLMs process information internally.

Method: Develops a quantitative 'Cognitive Profile' using the Entropy Decay Curve and the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to analyze predictive uncertainty across context lengths.

Result: Identifies unique, consistent cognitive profiles in LLMs, sensitive to model scale and text complexity.

Conclusion: Provides a principled framework for comparing and analyzing the operational dynamics of AI models.

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are now
extensively documented on task-specific benchmarks, yet the internal mechanisms
that produce these results are the subject of intense scientific inquiry. This
paper contributes to this inquiry by moving beyond metrics that measure
\textit{what} models can do, to a methodology that characterizes \textit{how}
they process information. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic approach to probe
these dynamics by creating a quantitative ``Cognitive Profile" for any given
model. This profile is centered on the \textbf{Entropy Decay Curve}, a
visualization that traces how a model's normalized predictive uncertainty
changes as a function of context length. Applying this methodology to several
state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse texts, we uncover unique and consistent
cognitive profiles that are sensitive to both model scale and text complexity.
We also introduce the Information Gain Span (IGS) index to summarize the
desirability of the decay trajectory. This work thus provides a new, principled
lens for analyzing and comparing the intrinsic operational dynamics of
artificial intelligence.

*Madhava Gaikwad,Ashwini Ramchandra Doke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NPO is an alignment-aware learning framework for human-in-the-loop systems, focusing on measurable alignment loss and meta-alignment for monitoring. It ensures convergence and demonstrates practical value in deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in treating alignment as a static property, NPO aims to provide a dynamic, feedback-driven approach for alignment in decision systems.

Method: NPO formalizes alignment loss and meta-alignment, using structured feedback (likes, overrides, abstentions) for scenario scoring, threshold tuning, and policy validation.

Result: The framework shows additive convergence of alignment loss and monitoring fidelity, with empirical success in hyperscale deployments.

Conclusion: NPO provides a scalable, inspectable architecture for continual alignment monitoring, bridging theory and practical reliability.

Abstract: We present NPO, an alignment-aware learning framework that operationalizes
feedback-driven adaptation in human-in-the-loop decision systems. Unlike prior
approaches that treat alignment as a static or post-hoc property, NPO
introduces a formalization of alignment loss that is measurable, supervisable,
and reducible under structured feedback. In parallel, we propose meta-alignment
as the fidelity of the monitoring process that governs retraining or override
triggers, and show that it is formally reducible to primary alignment via
threshold fidelity. Our implementation spans a scalable operational loop
involving scenario scoring, threshold tuning, policy validation, and structured
feedback ingestion, including "likes", overrides, and abstentions. We provide
formal convergence results under stochastic feedback and show that both
alignment loss and monitoring fidelity converge additively. Empirically, NPO
demonstrates measurable value in hyperscale deployment settings. A
simulation-based artifact and ablation studies further illustrate the
theoretical principles in action. Together, NPO offers a compact, inspectable
architecture for continual alignment monitoring, helping bridge theoretical
alignment guarantees with practical reliability in dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper examines risks of sycophancy and over-confidence in LLMs when providing life advice, proposing experiments to evaluate and mitigate these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack safeguards for high-stakes advice, risking misguided responses. The study aims to understand and address these risks.

Method: Three experiments: (1) multiple-choice evaluation under user pressure, (2) free-response analysis with a safety typology and LLM Judge, (3) mechanistic interpretability to steer behavior.

Result: Some models show sycophancy, but others like o4-mini remain robust. Top models achieve safety by asking clarifying questions. Activation steering can control cautiousness.

Conclusion: Nuanced benchmarks and safety alignment methods are needed to ensure LLMs can be trusted for life-changing decisions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted for high-stakes life
advice, yet they lack standard safeguards against providing confident but
misguided responses. This creates risks of sycophancy and over-confidence. This
paper investigates these failure modes through three experiments: (1) a
multiple-choice evaluation to measure model stability against user pressure;
(2) a free-response analysis using a novel safety typology and an LLM Judge;
and (3) a mechanistic interpretability experiment to steer model behavior by
manipulating a "high-stakes" activation vector. Our results show that while
some models exhibit sycophancy, others like o4-mini remain robust.
Top-performing models achieve high safety scores by frequently asking
clarifying questions, a key feature of a safe, inquisitive approach, rather
than issuing prescriptive advice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a model's
cautiousness can be directly controlled via activation steering, suggesting a
new path for safety alignment. These findings underscore the need for nuanced,
multi-faceted benchmarks to ensure LLMs can be trusted with life-changing
decisions.

*Arman Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes two new metrics to rate Sudoku difficulty, derived from SAT problem conversion and human-like solving strategies, and creates a universal rating system aligning well with most websites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and standardize Sudoku difficulty ratings across different websites.

Method: Two methods: converting Sudoku to SAT problems for structural complexity and simulating human solvers using backtracking with Nishio. Metrics derived from these methods.

Result: Strong correlation with website ratings for 4/5 sites; universal rating system classifies puzzles into three difficulty levels.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics and rating system effectively standardize Sudoku difficulty across websites, with practical applications for solvers.

Abstract: In this paper we try to answer the question "What constitutes Sudoku
difficulty rating across different Sudoku websites?" Using two distinct methods
that can both solve every Sudoku puzzle, I propose two new metrics to
characterize Sudoku difficulty. The first method is based on converting a
Sudoku puzzle into its corresponding Satisfiability (SAT) problem. The first
proposed metric is derived from SAT Clause Length Distribution which captures
the structural complexity of a Sudoku puzzle including the number of given
digits and the cells they are in. The second method simulates human Sudoku
solvers by intertwining four popular Sudoku strategies within a backtracking
algorithm called Nishio. The second metric is computed by counting the number
of times Sudoku strategies are applied within the backtracking iterations of a
randomized Nishio. Using these two metrics, I analyze more than a thousand
Sudoku puzzles across five popular websites to characterize every difficulty
level in each website. I evaluate the relationship between the proposed metrics
and website-labeled difficulty levels using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient, finding strong correlations for 4 out of 5 websites. I construct a
universal rating system using a simple, unsupervised classifier based on the
two proposed metrics. This rating system is capable of classifying both
individual puzzles and entire difficulty levels from the different Sudoku
websites into three categories - Universal Easy, Universal Medium, and
Universal Hard - thereby enabling consistent difficulty mapping across Sudoku
websites. The experimental results show that for 4 out of 5 Sudoku websites,
the universal classification aligns well with website-labeled difficulty
levels. Finally, I present an algorithm that can be used by early Sudoku
practitioners to solve Sudoku puzzles.

TL;DR: A framework for probing and steering harmful content in LLMs using interpretable directions in activation space, showing effective harm reduction with minimal utility loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate harmful behaviors in large language models (LLMs) by developing a scalable method for auditing and controlling such content.

Method: A multidimensional framework with 55 linear probes for distinct harmfulness subconcepts, forming a low-rank subspace. Ablation and steering experiments are conducted in this subspace.

Result: Dominant direction steering nearly eliminates harmfulness with minimal utility loss, demonstrating the effectiveness of concept subspaces for LLM control.

Conclusion: Concept subspaces offer a scalable and practical approach for auditing and hardening LLMs against harmful behaviors.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified the need to
understand and reliably curb their harmful behaviours. We introduce a
multidimensional framework for probing and steering harmful content in model
internals. For each of 55 distinct harmfulness subconcepts (e.g., racial hate,
employment scams, weapons), we learn a linear probe, yielding 55 interpretable
directions in activation space. Collectively, these directions span a
harmfulness subspace that we show is strikingly low-rank. We then test ablation
of the entire subspace from model internals, as well as steering and ablation
in the subspace's dominant direction. We find that dominant direction steering
allows for near elimination of harmfulness with a low decrease in utility. Our
findings advance the emerging view that concept subspaces provide a scalable
lens on LLM behaviour and offer practical tools for the community to audit and
harden future generations of language models.

*Nishani Fernando,Bahareh Nakisa,Adnan Ahmad,Mohammad Naim Rastgoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a framework (AXTF) for adaptive explainable AI (XAI) in high-stakes scenarios, using implicit feedback to enhance swift trust without disrupting workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swift trust in human-AI teams is critical in high-pressure environments like emergency response, but current XAI lacks adaptability and relies on impractical explicit feedback.

Method: AXTF uses physiological/behavioral signals (EEG, ECG, eye tracking) to infer user states and adapt explanations dynamically via a multi-objective trust estimation model.

Result: The framework enables personalized, non-intrusive XAI that adjusts explanations based on real-time cognitive/emotional states to foster swift trust.

Conclusion: AXTF lays groundwork for adaptive XAI systems suited to high-pressure, time-sensitive settings, improving human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Effective human-AI teaming heavily depends on swift trust, particularly in
high-stakes scenarios such as emergency response, where timely and accurate
decision-making is critical. In these time-sensitive and cognitively demanding
settings, adaptive explainability is essential for fostering trust between
human operators and AI systems. However, existing explainable AI (XAI)
approaches typically offer uniform explanations and rely heavily on explicit
feedback mechanisms, which are often impractical in such high-pressure
scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual framework for adaptive
XAI that operates non-intrusively by responding to users' real-time cognitive
and emotional states through implicit feedback, thereby enhancing swift trust
in high-stakes environments. The proposed adaptive explainability trust
framework (AXTF) leverages physiological and behavioral signals, such as EEG,
ECG, and eye tracking, to infer user states and support explanation adaptation.
At its core is a multi-objective, personalized trust estimation model that maps
workload, stress, and emotion to dynamic trust estimates. These estimates guide
the modulation of explanation features enabling responsive and personalized
support that promotes swift trust in human-AI collaboration. This conceptual
framework establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, non-intrusive XAI
systems tailored to the rigorous demands of high-pressure, time-sensitive
environments.

*Zhihao Peng,Liuxin Bao,Shengyuan Liu,Yixuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive cluster collaborativeness methodology for LLMs in healthcare, using self-diversity and cross-consistency mechanisms to improve medical decision support without predefined clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM collaborativeness lacks explicit component selection rules and relies on predefined clusters, leading to underperformance in medical scenarios.

Method: Introduces self-diversity (fuzzy matching of LLM outputs) and cross-consistency (masking inconsistent LLMs) mechanisms to optimize LLM clusters.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy (e.g., 65.47% vs. GPT-4's 56.12%) on medical datasets like NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health.

Conclusion: The method enhances LLM collaborativeness for medical decision support, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The collaborativeness of large language models (LLMs) has proven effective in
natural language processing systems, holding considerable promise for
healthcare development. However, it lacks explicit component selection rules,
necessitating human intervention or clinical-specific validation. Moreover,
existing architectures heavily rely on a predefined LLM cluster, where partial
LLMs underperform in medical decision support scenarios, invalidating the
collaborativeness of LLMs. To this end, we propose an adaptive cluster
collaborativeness methodology involving self-diversity and cross-consistency
maximization mechanisms to boost LLMs medical decision support capacity. For
the self-diversity, we calculate the fuzzy matching value of pairwise outputs
within an LLM as its self-diversity value, subsequently prioritizing LLMs with
high self-diversity values as cluster components in a training-free manner. For
the cross-consistency, we first measure cross-consistency values between the
LLM with the highest self-diversity value and others, and then gradually mask
out the LLM having the lowest cross-consistency value to eliminate the
potential inconsistent output during the collaborative propagation. Extensive
experiments on two specialized medical datasets, NEJMQA and MMLU-Pro-health,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across physician-oriented
specialties. For example, on NEJMQA, our method achieves the accuracy rate up
to the publicly official passing score across all disciplines, especially
achieving ACC of 65.47\% compared to the 56.12\% achieved by GPT-4 on the
Obstetrics and Gynecology discipline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A large language model (LLM)-based approach automates ADN dispatch by decomposing problems into stages and using multi-LLM coordination for modeling and optimization, improving efficiency and accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized expertise among ADN operators makes human reliance costly and time-intensive, necessitating an automated solution.

Method: Decomposes ADN dispatch into stages, designs a multi-LLM framework (Information Extractor, Problem Formulator, Code Programmer), and refines each agent for accuracy.

Result: Validated through comparisons and demonstrations, the approach enables efficient dispatch via natural language queries.

Conclusion: The LLM-powered method effectively bridges the knowledge gap, offering a user-friendly and reliable solution for ADN dispatch.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources into active
distribution networks (ADNs) has made effective ADN dispatch imperative.
However, the numerous newly-integrated ADN operators, such as distribution
system aggregators, virtual power plant managers, and end prosumers, often lack
specialized expertise in power system operation, modeling, optimization, and
programming. This knowledge gap renders reliance on human experts both costly
and time-intensive. To address this challenge and enable intelligent, flexible
ADN dispatch, this paper proposes a large language model (LLM) powered
automated modeling and optimization approach. First, the ADN dispatch problems
are decomposed into sequential stages, and a multi-LLM coordination
architecture is designed. This framework comprises an Information Extractor, a
Problem Formulator, and a Code Programmer, tasked with information retrieval,
optimization problem formulation, and code implementation, respectively.
Afterwards, tailored refinement techniques are developed for each LLM agent,
greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of generated content. The
proposed approach features a user-centric interface that enables ADN operators
to derive dispatch strategies via simple natural language queries, eliminating
technical barriers and increasing efficiency. Comprehensive comparisons and
end-to-end demonstrations on various test cases validate the effectiveness of

*Federico Donato,Adrien Barton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper characterizes risk using BFO, classifying it as a subclass of BFO:Role rather than BFO:Disposition, and provides an example to generalize risk analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the ontological nature of risk by contrasting its classification as a role versus a disposition in the BFO framework.

Method: Uses BFO categories to model risk, applies this to an example involving objects and processes, and generalizes the analysis.

Result: Identifies sufficient conditions for classifying something as risk and hints at necessary conditions for future research.

Conclusion: Risk is best classified as a subclass of BFO:Role, with implications for ontology and risk analysis.

Abstract: The paper explores the nature of risk, providing a characterization using the
categories of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It argues that the category Risk
is a subclass of BFO:Role, contrasting it with a similar view classifying Risk
as a subclass of BFO:Disposition. This modeling choice is applied on one
example of risk, which represents objects, processes (both physical and mental)
and their interrelations, then generalizing from the instances in the example
to obtain an overall analysis of risk, making explicit what are the sufficient
conditions for being a risk. Plausible necessary conditions are also mentioned
for future work. Index Terms: ontology, risk, BFO, role, disposition

*Farzana Islam Adiba,Rahmatollah Beheshti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel framework combining knowledge graphs and auxiliary LLMs to systematically identify and mitigate biases in medical LLMs, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address biased and unfair patterns in medical LLMs before clinical adoption, ensuring fair decision-making.

Method: Integrates adversarial perturbation and multi-hop KG characterization to reveal subtle biases systematically.

Result: Demonstrates superior ability and scalability in identifying complex biases across datasets, LLMs, and bias types.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances bias detection in medical LLMs, aiding mitigation for clinical use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) that are used in medical applications are known
to show biased and unfair patterns. Prior to adopting these in clinical
decision-making applications, it is crucial to identify these bias patterns to
enable effective mitigation of their impact. In this study, we present a novel
framework combining knowledge graphs (KGs) with auxiliary LLMs to
systematically reveal complex bias patterns in medical LLMs. Specifically, the
proposed approach integrates adversarial perturbation techniques to identify
subtle bias patterns. The approach adopts a customized multi-hop
characterization of KGs to enhance the systematic evaluation of arbitrary LLMs.
Through a series of comprehensive experiments (on three datasets, six LLMs, and
five bias types), we show that our proposed framework has noticeably greater
ability and scalability to reveal complex biased patterns of LLMs compared to
other baselines.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Agentic Web, a new internet phase where AI agents interact autonomously, and presents a framework for its development, covering intelligence, interaction, and economics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift from human-driven to machine-to-machine interactions aims to automate tasks and enhance web experiences, necessitating a structured understanding of this transition.

Method: The paper proposes a conceptual model with three dimensions (intelligence, interaction, economics) and analyzes architectural challenges like communication protocols and orchestration.

Result: The framework identifies key capabilities of AI agents (e.g., retrieval, collaboration) and discusses scalability challenges and emerging paradigms like the Agent Attention Economy.

Conclusion: The paper highlights applications, risks, and governance issues of agentic systems, suggesting research directions for secure and intelligent ecosystems.

Abstract: The emergence of AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) marks a
pivotal shift toward the Agentic Web, a new phase of the internet defined by
autonomous, goal-driven interactions. In this paradigm, agents interact
directly with one another to plan, coordinate, and execute complex tasks on
behalf of users. This transition from human-driven to machine-to-machine
interaction allows intent to be delegated, relieving users from routine digital
operations and enabling a more interactive, automated web experience. In this
paper, we present a structured framework for understanding and building the
Agentic Web. We trace its evolution from the PC and Mobile Web eras and
identify the core technological foundations that support this shift. Central to
our framework is a conceptual model consisting of three key dimensions:
intelligence, interaction, and economics. These dimensions collectively enable
the capabilities of AI agents, such as retrieval, recommendation, planning, and
collaboration. We analyze the architectural and infrastructural challenges
involved in creating scalable agentic systems, including communication
protocols, orchestration strategies, and emerging paradigms such as the Agent
Attention Economy. We conclude by discussing the potential applications,
societal risks, and governance issues posed by agentic systems, and outline
research directions for developing open, secure, and intelligent ecosystems
shaped by both human intent and autonomous agent behavior. A continuously

### [108] [CompoST: A Benchmark for Analyzing the Ability of LLMs To Compositionally Interpret Questions in a QALD Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21257)
*David Maria Schmidt,Raoul Schubert,Philipp Cimiano*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates the compositional interpretation abilities of large language models (LLMs) by testing their performance on structured datasets mapping questions to SPARQL queries. Results show LLMs struggle with systematic interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how systematically LLMs interpret complex questions, given their success in simpler tasks.

Method: Created controlled datasets based on DBpedia graph patterns, tested LLMs with prompts, few-shot learning, and fine-tuning.

Result: Performance degrades with complexity, with F1 scores dropping from 0.45 to 0.09. Even simple tasks max at 0.57 F1.

Conclusion: LLMs lack systematic, compositional interpretation skills for mapping questions to SPARQL queries.

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

### [109] [LeMix: Unified Scheduling for LLM Training and Inference on Multi-GPU Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21276)
*Yufei Li,Zexin Li,Yinglun Zhu,Cong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeMix is a system for co-locating LLM serving and training workloads, improving efficiency and performance over traditional separate setups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inefficiencies in GPU utilization and delayed adaptation due to separate serving and training phases in LLM deployment.

Method: Integrates offline profiling, execution prediction, and runtime scheduling to dynamically allocate resources.

Result: Improves throughput by 3.53x, reduces inference loss by 0.61x, and enhances response time SLO attainment by 2.12x.

Conclusion: LeMix demonstrates the benefits of joint LLM inference and training for resource-efficient deployment.

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-based coding assistant improves code generation by asking clarification questions for ambiguous prompts, outperforming zero-shot methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with ambiguous developer prompts, leading to incorrect code generation. This work aims to enhance accuracy by mimicking human code review.

Method: The system includes a query classifier for detecting unclear prompts and a fine-tuned LLM to generate clarification questions.

Result: The fine-tuned LLM outperforms zero-shot prompting in generating useful questions, and users prefer its accuracy over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed coding assistant improves code response accuracy by addressing prompt ambiguity through clarification questions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as coding assistants.
However, the ambiguity of the developer's prompt often leads to incorrect code
generation, as current models struggle to infer user intent without extensive
prompt engineering or external context. This work aims to build an LLM-based
coding assistant that mimics the human code review process by asking
clarification questions when faced with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
  Our end-to-end system includes (1) a query classifier trained to detect
unclear programming-related queries and (2) a fine-tuned LLM that generates
clarification questions. Our evaluation shows that the fine-tuned LLM
outperforms standard zero-shot prompting in generating useful clarification
questions. Furthermore, our user study indicates that users find the
clarification questions generated by our model to outperform the baseline,
demonstrating that our coding assistant produces more accurate and helpful code
responses compared to baseline coding assistants.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for structured relevance assessment improves Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) by enhancing document evaluation, knowledge integration, and handling unanswerable queries, reducing factual errors and improving transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RALMs struggle with factual errors in document relevance and knowledge integration, necessitating a robust solution for reliable question-answering systems.

Method: The approach uses a multi-dimensional scoring system (semantic matching and source reliability), embedding-based relevance scoring, synthetic training data, and specialized benchmarking. It includes a knowledge integration mechanism and an "unknown" response protocol.

Result: Preliminary evaluations show reduced hallucination rates and improved reasoning transparency.

Conclusion: The framework advances RALM reliability, though challenges like distinguishing credible information and balancing latency remain.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) face significant challenges in
reducing factual errors, particularly in document relevance evaluation and
knowledge integration. We introduce a framework for structured relevance
assessment that enhances RALM robustness through improved document evaluation,
balanced intrinsic and external knowledge integration, and effective handling
of unanswerable queries. Our approach employs a multi-dimensional scoring
system that considers both semantic matching and source reliability, utilizing
embedding-based relevance scoring and synthetic training data with
mixed-quality documents. We implement specialized benchmarking on niche topics,
a knowledge integration mechanism, and an "unknown" response protocol for
queries with insufficient knowledge coverage. Preliminary evaluations
demonstrate significant reductions in hallucination rates and improved
transparency in reasoning processes. Our framework advances the development of
more reliable question-answering systems capable of operating effectively in
dynamic environments with variable data quality. While challenges persist in
accurately distinguishing credible information and balancing system latency
with thoroughness, this work represents a meaningful step toward enhancing RALM
reliability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Trans-ACT integrates Transactional Analysis into Multi-Agent Systems to create agents with realistic psychological dynamics, improving social interaction simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS frameworks lack cognitive complexity for human-like behavior. Trans-ACT addresses this by embedding TA principles.

Method: Trans-ACT incorporates Parent, Adult, and Child ego states into agents, using context-specific memories and life scripts to shape responses.

Result: Agents with TA principles produce deeper, context-aware interactions, demonstrated in the Stupid game scenario.

Conclusion: Trans-ACT enables advanced applications like conflict resolution, educational support, and social psychology studies.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are increasingly used to simulate social
interactions, but most of the frameworks miss the underlying cognitive
complexity of human behavior. In this paper, we introduce Trans-ACT
(Transactional Analysis Cognitive Toolkit), an approach embedding Transactional
Analysis (TA) principles into MAS to generate agents with realistic
psychological dynamics. Trans-ACT integrates the Parent, Adult, and Child ego
states into an agent's cognitive architecture. Each ego state retrieves
context-specific memories and uses them to shape response to new situations.
The final answer is chosen according to the underlying life script of the
agent. Our experimental simulation, which reproduces the Stupid game scenario,
demonstrates that agents grounded in cognitive and TA principles produce deeper
and context-aware interactions. Looking ahead, our research opens a new way for
a variety of applications, including conflict resolution, educational support,
and advanced social psychology studies.

*Nicholas Botti,Flora Haberkorn,Charlotte Hoopes,Shaun Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI RAG tools improve speed and accuracy in data annotation tasks, especially in interactive use, saving significant time compared to human-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of AI retrieval augmented generation (RAG) tools in assisting analysts with complex information extraction and annotation tasks.

Method: A within-subjects design with randomized task assignments, comparing a 'naive' AI condition (accepting first answers) and an 'interactive' AI condition (using judgment for follow-up) against a human-only baseline.

Result: AI tools accelerated task execution by up to 10x and improved accuracy, particularly in the interactive condition, saving up to 268 hours for the full task. Annotator skill with AI tools also impacted performance.

Conclusion: Interactive AI RAG tools significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy in annotation tasks, with annotator AI proficiency playing a key role.

Abstract: We utilize a within-subjects design with randomized task assignments to
understand the effectiveness of using an AI retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) tool to assist analysts with an information extraction and data
annotation task. We replicate an existing, challenging real-world annotation
task with complex multi-part criteria on a set of thousands of pages of public
disclosure documents from global systemically important banks (GSIBs) with
heterogeneous and incomplete information content. We test two treatment
conditions. First, a "naive" AI use condition in which annotators use only the
tool and must accept the first answer they are given. And second, an
"interactive" AI treatment condition where annotators use the tool
interactively, and use their judgement to follow-up with additional information
if necessary. Compared to the human-only baseline, the use of the AI tool
accelerated task execution by up to a factor of 10 and enhanced task accuracy,
particularly in the interactive condition. We find that when extrapolated to
the full task, these methods could save up to 268 hours compared to the
human-only approach. Additionally, our findings suggest that annotator skill,
not just with the subject matter domain, but also with AI tools, is a factor in
both the accuracy and speed of task performance.

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining Liquid Neural Networks (LNN) and XGBoost is proposed to optimize supply chain ordering strategies, addressing the bullwhip effect and improving profitability by leveraging LNN's adaptability and XGBoost's optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to handle dynamic supply chain challenges like demand fluctuations and the bullwhip effect, while existing machine learning techniques face computational and training inefficiencies.

Method: The study introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model, utilizing LNN for dynamic feature extraction and XGBoost for global optimization in multi-tier supply chains.

Result: The hybrid model aims to mitigate the bullwhip effect and enhance profitability by combining local adaptability and global efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach fills a gap in supply chain methodologies, offering an innovative, dynamic, and efficient solution.

Abstract: Supply chain management faces significant challenges, including demand
fluctuations, inventory imbalances, and amplified upstream order variability
due to the bullwhip effect. Traditional methods, such as simple moving
averages, struggle to address dynamic market conditions. Emerging machine
learning techniques, including LSTM, reinforcement learning, and XGBoost, offer
potential solutions but are limited by computational complexity, training
inefficiencies, or constraints in time-series modeling. Liquid Neural Networks,
inspired by dynamic biological systems, present a promising alternative due to
their adaptability, low computational cost, and robustness to noise, making
them suitable for real-time decision-making and edge computing. Despite their
success in applications like autonomous vehicles and medical monitoring, their
potential in supply chain optimization remains underexplored. This study
introduces a hybrid LNN and XGBoost model to optimize ordering strategies in
multi-tier supply chains. By leveraging LNN's dynamic feature extraction and
XGBoost's global optimization capabilities, the model aims to mitigate the
bullwhip effect and enhance cumulative profitability. The research investigates
how local and global synergies within the hybrid framework address the dual
demands of adaptability and efficiency in SCM. The proposed approach fills a
critical gap in existing methodologies, offering an innovative solution for
dynamic and efficient supply chain management.

*Tenghao Huang,Sihao Chen,Muhao Chen,Jonathan May,Longqi Yang,Mengting Wan,Pei Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces proactive information gathering for LLMs, using reinforcement finetuning to improve their ability to ask targeted questions and fill context gaps, outperforming baselines in evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with incomplete prompts, failing to proactively gather missing information, which limits their effectiveness as collaborative partners.

Method: A reinforcement finetuning strategy is designed to train LLMs to ask questions that elicit implicit user knowledge, using a framework of partially specified tasks.

Result: The Qwen-2.5-7B model outperforms o3-mini by 18% in automatic metrics and is preferred by humans for clarification questions (42%) and final outlines (28%).

Conclusion: Proactive clarification enhances LLMs' collaboration potential, transforming them from passive generators to active thought partners.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

*Meilin Zhu,Gaojie Jin,Xiaowei Huang,Lijun Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Shapley-based uncertainty metric for LLMs, outperforming semantic entropy in predicting model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for better uncertainty measures in LLMs to determine trustworthiness in outputs.

Method: Develops a Shapley-based uncertainty metric capturing continuous semantic relationships, validated by three fundamental properties.

Result: Shapley uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in QA tasks than baseline measures.

Conclusion: The Shapley-based framework provides a superior, nuanced approach to measuring uncertainty in LLMs.

Abstract: In question-answering tasks, determining when to trust the outputs is crucial
to the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Kuhn et al. (2023) introduces
semantic entropy as a measure of uncertainty, by incorporating linguistic
invariances from the same meaning. It primarily relies on setting threshold to
measure the level of semantic equivalence relation. We propose a more nuanced
framework that extends beyond such thresholding by developing a Shapley-based
uncertainty metric that captures the continuous nature of semantic
relationships. We establish three fundamental properties that characterize
valid uncertainty metrics and prove that our Shapley uncertainty satisfies
these criteria. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our Shapley
uncertainty more accurately predicts LLM performance in question-answering and
other datasets, compared to similar baseline measures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of LLMs in agentic procedures (e.g., planning, memory) and unify fragmented research on GLA.

Method: Categorizes GLA methods by their roles in LLM systems and analyzes graph contributions. Discusses multi-agent systems and future directions.

Result: Highlights how graphs enhance LLM agent workflows and identifies key areas for future research.

Conclusion: The paper serves as a roadmap for advancing GLA research and understanding graphs' role in LLM agent systems.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web
navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are
limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term
memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a
powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination
in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of
research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and
comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions
for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their
primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool
usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to
each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate
the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS.
Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from
improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal
GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on
GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs in government focus on safety but neglect core capabilities like domain relevance.

Method: Proposes GovRelBench with domain-specific prompts and GovRelBERT, trained using SoftGovScore to convert hard labels to soft scores for relevance assessment.

Result: GovRelBERT accurately computes government domain relevance scores, enhancing evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: GovRelBench provides a valuable tool for assessing LLMs in the government domain, with code and dataset publicly available.

Abstract: Current evaluations of LLMs in the government domain primarily focus on
safety considerations in specific scenarios, while the assessment of the
models' own core capabilities, particularly domain relevance, remains
insufficient. To address this gap, we propose GovRelBench, a benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating the core capabilities of LLMs in the
government domain. GovRelBench consists of government domain prompts and a
dedicated evaluation tool, GovRelBERT. During the training process of
GovRelBERT, we introduce the SoftGovScore method: this method trains a model
based on the ModernBERT architecture by converting hard labels to soft scores,
enabling it to accurately compute the text's government domain relevance score.
This work aims to enhance the capability evaluation framework for large models
in the government domain, providing an effective tool for relevant research and

*Vishal Raman,Vijai Aravindh R*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-DKD is a dual-decoder framework for autonomous ontology evolution, combining structured and unstructured knowledge in LLMs for accurate and efficient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ontology curation is labor-intensive, and LLMs struggle with structured consistency, necessitating a hybrid approach.

Method: Evo-DKD uses dual decoders (one for edits, one for justifications) with dynamic gating, simulated via prompt-based mode control due to GPU constraints.

Result: Outperforms baselines in precision and downstream tasks, validated through healthcare, semantic search, and cultural heritage use cases.

Conclusion: Evo-DKD successfully merges symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Abstract: Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.

Rx integrated Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC)
guidelines with Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) data to generate
contextually relevant responses. A dataset (N=260 queries) spanning 26 CPIC
guidelines was used to evaluate drug-gene interactions, dosing recommendations,
and therapeutic implications. In Phase 1, only CPIC data was embedded. Phase 2
additionally incorporated PharmGKB content. Responses were scored on accuracy,
relevance, clarity, completeness (5-point Likert scale), and recall. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests compared accuracy between Phase 1 and Phase 2, and between
Phase 2 and ChatGPT-4omini. A 20-question quiz assessed the tool's real-world
applicability against other models. In Phase 1 (N=260), Sherpa Rx demonstrated
high performance of accuracy 4.9, relevance 5.0, clarity 5.0, completeness 4.8,
and recall 0.99. The subset analysis (N=20) showed improvements in accuracy
(4.6 vs. 4.4, Phase 2 vs. Phase 1 subset) and completeness (5.0 vs. 4.8).
ChatGPT-4omini performed comparably in relevance (5.0) and clarity (4.9) but
lagged in accuracy (3.9) and completeness (4.2). Differences in accuracy
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 was not statistically significant. However, Phase 2
significantly outperformed ChatGPT-4omini. On the 20-question quiz, Sherpa Rx
achieved 90% accuracy, outperforming other models. Integrating additional
resources like CPIC and PharmGKB with RAG enhances AI accuracy and performance.
This study highlights the transformative potential of generative AI like Sherpa
Rx in pharmacogenomics, improving decision-making with accurate, personalized
responses.

### [121] [An LLM Driven Agent Framework for Automated Infrared Spectral Multi Task Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21471)
*Zujie Xie,Zixuan Chen,Jiheng Liang,Xiangyang Yu,Ziru Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-driven framework for accurate infrared spectral analysis under low-data conditions, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared spectroscopy's high-dimensional, overlapping bands challenge conventional methods; LLMs offer potential for automation and accuracy.

Method: End-to-end LLM framework integrating literature knowledge, preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi-task reasoning with iterative refinement.

Result: Outperforms single-turn inference and rivals/exceeds ML/DL models in low-data scenarios across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: LLM-driven spectral analysis is effective and adaptable, especially in low-data conditions.

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy offers rapid, non destructive measurement of chemical
and material properties but suffers from high dimensional, overlapping spectral
bands that challenge conventional chemometric approaches. Emerging large
language models (LLMs), with their capacity for generalization and reasoning,
offer promising potential for automating complex scientific workflows. Despite
this promise, their application in IR spectral analysis remains largely
unexplored. This study addresses the critical challenge of achieving accurate,
automated infrared spectral interpretation under low-data conditions using an
LLM-driven framework. We introduce an end-to-end, large language model driven
agent framework that integrates a structured literature knowledge base,
automated spectral preprocessing, feature extraction, and multi task reasoning
in a unified pipeline. By querying a curated corpus of peer reviewed IR
publications, the agent selects scientifically validated routines. The selected
methods transform each spectrum into low dimensional feature sets, which are
fed into few shot prompt templates for classification, regression, and anomaly
detection. A closed loop, multi turn protocol iteratively appends mispredicted
samples to the prompt, enabling dynamic refinement of predictions. Across
diverse materials: stamp pad ink, Chinese medicine, Pu'er tea, Citri
Reticulatae Pericarpium and waste water COD datasets, the multi turn LLM
consistently outperforms single turn inference, rivaling or exceeding machine
learning and deep learning models under low data regimes.

*Zhenwei Tang,Difan Jiao,Eric Xue,Reid McIlroy-Young,Jon Kleinberg,Siddhartha Sen,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maia4All is a framework for efficient human-AI alignment in chess, requiring only 20 games per individual instead of 5,000, using a two-stage optimization process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop AI systems that accurately emulate individual decision-making with limited data, addressing the impracticality of existing methods.

Method: A two-stage process: (1) enrichment step bridging population and individual behavior modeling, and (2) democratization step refining individual embeddings with minimal data.

Result: Maia4All accurately predicts individual moves and profiles behavior with high fidelity, using only 20 games per user.

Conclusion: Maia4All sets a new standard for personalized AI behavior modeling, with potential applications beyond chess.

Abstract: As humans seek to collaborate with, learn from, and better understand
artificial intelligence systems, developing AIs that can accurately emulate
individual decision-making becomes increasingly important. Chess, a
long-standing AI benchmark with precise skill measurement, offers an ideal
testbed for human-AI alignment. However, existing approaches to modeling human
behavior require prohibitively large amounts of data from each individual,
making them impractical for new or sparsely represented users. In this work, we
introduce Maia4All, a framework designed to learn and adapt to individual
decision-making styles efficiently, even with limited data. Maia4All achieves
this through a two-stage optimization process: (1) an enrichment step, which
bridges population and individual-level human behavior modeling with a
prototype-enriched model, and (2) a democratization step, which leverages
ability levels or user prototypes to initialize and refine individual
embeddings with minimal data. Our experimental results show that Maia4All can
accurately predict individual moves and profile behavioral patterns with high
fidelity, establishing a new standard for personalized human-like AI behavior
modeling in chess. Maia4All achieves individual human behavior modeling in
chess with only 20 games, compared to the 5,000 games required previously,
representing a significant improvement in data efficiency. Our work provides an
example of how population AI systems can flexibly adapt to individual users
using a prototype-enriched model as a bridge. This approach extends beyond
chess, as shown in our case study on idiosyncratic LLMs, highlighting its
potential for broader applications in personalized AI adaptation.

*David Simchi-Levi,Konstantina Mellou,Ishai Menache,Jeevan Pathuri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs democratize supply chain tech by automating understanding, scenario analysis, and model updates, reducing decision time from days to minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Business planners face delays in understanding, analyzing, and updating supply chain tools, requiring external help.

Method: Apply Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate explanations, scenario analysis, and model updates.

Result: Decision time reduced from days/weeks to minutes/hours, boosting productivity.

Conclusion: LLMs enable faster, more autonomous supply chain decision-making, enhancing efficiency.

Abstract: Supply Chain Management requires addressing a variety of complex
decision-making challenges, from sourcing strategies to planning and execution.
Over the last few decades, advances in computation and information technologies
have enabled the transition from manual, intuition and experience-based
decision-making, into more automated and data-driven decisions using a variety
of tools that apply optimization techniques. These techniques use mathematical
methods to improve decision-making.
  Unfortunately, business planners and executives still need to spend
considerable time and effort to (i) understand and explain the recommendations
coming out of these technologies; (ii) analyze various scenarios and answer
what-if questions; and (iii) update the mathematical models used in these tools
to reflect current business environments. Addressing these challenges requires
involving data science teams and/or the technology providers to explain results
or make the necessary changes in the technology and hence significantly slows
down decision making.
  Motivated by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), we report
how this disruptive technology can democratize supply chain technology -
namely, facilitate the understanding of tools' outcomes, as well as the
interaction with supply chain tools without human-in-the-loop. Specifically, we
report how we apply LLMs to address the three challenges described above, thus
substantially reducing the time to decision from days and weeks to minutes and
hours as well as dramatically increasing planners' and executives' productivity
and impact.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper assesses honesty in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) when answering visually unanswerable questions, introduces MoHoBench for benchmarking, and proposes alignment methods to improve honesty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advancements in MLLMs, their honesty in handling visually unanswerable questions is underexplored, posing risks of harmful content.

Method: The study defines four types of unanswerable visual questions, constructs MoHoBench (12k+ samples), benchmarks 28 MLLMs, and implements alignment methods via supervised and preference learning.

Result: Most models fail to refuse unanswerable questions appropriately, and honesty is influenced by visual information, not just language modeling.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for dedicated methods to align MLLMs for honesty, providing initial solutions and a benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

*Kenneth Li,Fernanda Viégas,Martin Wattenberg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes criteria to define when a neural net learns a 'world model,' focusing on latent state space representation and avoiding trivial interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide operational meaning to informal terms and establish a common language for experimental investigation.

Method: Uses ideas from linear probing literature to formalize computations factoring through a representation of the data generation process, with added conditions to ensure non-triviality.

Result: A precise definition of a 'world model' in neural nets, excluding trivial cases.

Conclusion: The criteria offer a foundation for future research on world models, particularly in representing latent state spaces.

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ST-GDance is a framework for generating synchronized group dances from music, addressing scalability and collision issues by decoupling spatial and temporal dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Group dance generation is challenging due to computational complexity and motion collisions, especially with more dancers and longer sequences. Existing methods struggle with dense spatial-temporal interactions.

Method: ST-GDance uses lightweight graph convolutions for spatial modeling and sparse attention for temporal modeling, optimizing long-term and collision-free choreography.

Result: Experiments show ST-GDance outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for long and coherent group dance sequences.

Conclusion: ST-GDance effectively addresses scalability and collision issues in group dance generation, offering a practical solution for applications in film, gaming, and animation.

Abstract: Group dance generation from music has broad applications in film, gaming, and
animation production. However, it requires synchronizing multiple dancers while
maintaining spatial coordination. As the number of dancers and sequence length
increase, this task faces higher computational complexity and a greater risk of
motion collisions. Existing methods often struggle to model dense
spatial-temporal interactions, leading to scalability issues and multi-dancer
collisions. To address these challenges, we propose ST-GDance, a novel
framework that decouples spatial and temporal dependencies to optimize
long-term and collision-free group choreography. We employ lightweight graph
convolutions for distance-aware spatial modeling and accelerated sparse
attention for efficient temporal modeling. This design significantly reduces
computational costs while ensuring smooth and collision-free interactions.
Experiments on the AIOZ-GDance dataset demonstrate that ST-GDance outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in generating long and coherent group
dance sequences. Project page: https://yilliajing.github.io/ST-GDance-Website/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing complexity and dynamics of wireless systems require intelligent, adaptive solutions, which LLMs can provide due to their reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Method: The study examines three approaches: adapting pretrained LLMs for wireless tasks, creating specialized foundation models, and developing autonomous LLM agents for coordination.

Result: LLM-based approaches show unique benefits over traditional methods, with practical case studies demonstrating their potential.

versatility and efficiency, and enabling agentic LLMs with autonomous reasoning
and coordination capabilities. We highlight recent advances, practical case
studies, and the unique benefits of LLM-based approaches over traditional

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a personalized AI explanation approach tailored to user preferences and context, using a dynamic memory model to estimate relevant information for each user.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI explanations focus on model internals, often unsuitable for non-experts. A human-centered approach is needed, considering individual preferences and context.

Method: The paper introduces a personalized explanation model where the AI agent uses a dynamic memory of past interactions to tailor explanations to the user.

Result: The proposed method enables AI agents to provide context-aware, user-specific explanations, improving transparency for non-experts.

Conclusion: Personalized explanations, based on user context and history, enhance AI transparency and usability for non-experts.

Abstract: The need for explanations in AI has, by and large, been driven by the desire
to increase the transparency of black-box machine learning models. However,
such explanations, which focus on the internal mechanisms that lead to a
specific output, are often unsuitable for non-experts. To facilitate a
human-centered perspective on AI explanations, agents need to focus on
individuals and their preferences as well as the context in which the
explanations are given. This paper proposes a personalized approach to
explanation, where the agent tailors the information provided to the user based
on what is most likely pertinent to them. We propose a model of the agent's
worldview that also serves as a personal and dynamic memory of its previous
interactions with the same user, based on which the artificial agent can
estimate what part of its knowledge is most likely new information to the user.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces SafeDrive228K, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in traffic safety-critical scenarios, and proposes SafeDriveRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation method to enhance VLMs' performance in safety-sensitive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks evaluation of VLMs in traffic safety-critical driving scenarios, prompting the creation of a benchmark and a new baseline method to address this gap.

Method: The authors develop SafeDrive228K, a 228K-example benchmark, and propose SafeDriveRAG, a knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach with multi-scale subgraph retrieval for VQA.

Result: Integrating RAG improves performance: +4.73% in Traffic Accidents, +8.79% in Corner Cases, and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five VLMs.

Conclusion: The benchmark and methodology show promise for advancing traffic safety research, with significant performance gains demonstrated.

Abstract: In this work, we study how vision-language models (VLMs) can be utilized to
enhance the safety for the autonomous driving system, including perception,
situational understanding, and path planning. However, existing research has
largely overlooked the evaluation of these models in traffic safety-critical
driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we create the benchmark (SafeDrive228K)
and propose a new baseline based on VLM with knowledge graph-based
retrieval-augmented generation (SafeDriveRAG) for visual question answering
(VQA). Specifically, we introduce SafeDrive228K, the first large-scale
multimodal question-answering benchmark comprising 228K examples across 18
sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses a diverse range of traffic safety
queries, from traffic accidents and corner cases to common safety knowledge,
enabling a thorough assessment of the comprehension and reasoning abilities of
the models. Furthermore, we propose a plug-and-play multimodal knowledge
graph-based retrieval-augmented generation approach that employs a novel
multi-scale subgraph retrieval algorithm for efficient information retrieval.
By incorporating traffic safety guidelines collected from the Internet, this
framework further enhances the model's capacity to handle safety-critical
situations. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on five mainstream
VLMs to assess their reliability in safety-sensitive driving tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RAG significantly improves
performance, achieving a +4.73% gain in Traffic Accidents tasks, +8.79% in
Corner Cases tasks and +14.57% in Traffic Safety Commonsense across five
mainstream VLMs, underscoring the potential of our proposed benchmark and
methodology for advancing research in traffic safety. Our source code and data

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PHP, a three-stage method for audio-visual multi-task incremental learning, balancing knowledge retention and new task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of preserving old task knowledge while learning new tasks in audio-visual multi-task incremental learning.

Method: PHP involves three phases: shallow (task-shared modality adapter), middle (task-specific modality-shared dynamic adapter), and deep (task-specific modality-independent prompts).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS, AVQA).

Conclusion: PHP effectively balances knowledge sharing and specificity, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

*Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores the underutilized role of Bayesian inference in embodied intelligence, analyzing its potential to enhance adaptive behavior in open physical-world environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Bayesian principles are not widely applied in embodied intelligence systems despite their theoretical alignment with adaptive behavior under uncertainty.

Method: The study compares Bayesian and contemporary approaches through the lenses of search and learning, inspired by Rich Sutton's 'The Bitter Lesson.'

Result: Bayesian inference is underused in modern embodied intelligence, which remains limited to closed environments. Bayesian methods could bridge this gap.

Conclusion: Bayesian methods hold promise for advancing embodied intelligence toward open-world adaptability, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence posits that cognitive capabilities fundamentally emerge
from - and are shaped by - an agent's real-time sensorimotor interactions with
its environment. Such adaptive behavior inherently requires continuous
inference under uncertainty. Bayesian statistics offers a principled
probabilistic framework to address this challenge by representing knowledge as
probability distributions and updating beliefs in response to new evidence. The
core computational processes underlying embodied intelligence - including
perception, action selection, learning, and even higher-level cognition - can
be effectively understood and modeled as forms of Bayesian inference. Despite
the deep conceptual connection between Bayesian statistics and embodied
intelligence, Bayesian principles have not been widely or explicitly applied in
today's embodied intelligence systems. In this work, we examine both Bayesian
and contemporary embodied intelligence approaches through two fundamental
lenses: search and learning - the two central themes in modern AI, as
highlighted in Rich Sutton's influential essay "The Bitter Lesson". This
analysis sheds light on why Bayesian inference has not played a central role in
the development of modern embodied intelligence. At the same time, it reveals
that current embodied intelligence systems remain largely confined to
closed-physical-world environments, and highlights the potential for Bayesian
methods to play a key role in extending these systems toward truly open
physical-world embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: Extends legible decision-making to multi-agent teams, showing improved performance over standard optimal agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legibility research focuses on single-agent-human interactions, missing benefits for multi-agent teamwork.

Method: Proposes an extension of legible decision-making for multi-agent settings and tests it in benchmark scenarios.

Result: Teams with legible agents outperform those with standard optimal behavior.

Conclusion: Legible decision-making enhances performance in multi-agent teamwork.

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the notion of legibility in sequential
decision-making in the context of teams and teamwork. There have been works
that extend the notion of legibility to sequential decision making, for
deterministic and for stochastic scenarios. However, these works focus on one
agent interacting with one human, foregoing the benefits of having legible
decision making in teams of agents or in team configurations with humans. In
this work we propose an extension of legible decision-making to multi-agent
settings that improves the performance of agents working in collaboration. We
showcase the performance of legible decision making in team scenarios using our
proposed extension in multi-agent benchmark scenarios. We show that a team with
a legible agent is able to outperform a team composed solely of agents with
standard optimal behaviour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the intertwined challenges of staffing (task assignment/scheduling) and profiling (worker attribute estimation) in workforce management using LLMs.

Method: Introduces StaffPro, an LLM agent that formalizes staffing and profiling in a mathematical framework, uses natural language for objectives, and establishes a human-agent feedback loop.

Result: StaffPro successfully estimates worker attributes and generates high-quality schedules in a consulting firm simulation.

Conclusion: StaffPro provides a robust, interpretable, and human-centric solution for automated personnel management.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents integrate pre-trained LLMs with modular
algorithmic components and have shown remarkable reasoning and decision-making
abilities. In this work, we investigate their use for two tightly intertwined
challenges in workforce management: staffing, i.e., the assignment and
scheduling of tasks to workers, which may require team formation; and
profiling, i.e., the continuous estimation of workers' skills, preferences, and
other latent attributes from unstructured data. We cast these problems in a
formal mathematical framework that links scheduling decisions to latent feature
estimation, and we introduce StaffPro, an LLM agent that addresses staffing and
profiling jointly. Differently from existing staffing solutions, StaffPro
allows expressing optimization objectives using natural language, accepts
textual task descriptions and provides high flexibility. StaffPro interacts
directly with humans by establishing a continuous human-agent feedback loop,
ensuring natural and intuitive use. By analyzing human feedback, our agent
continuously estimates the latent features of workers, realizing life-long
worker profiling and ensuring optimal staffing performance over time. A
consulting firm simulation example demonstrates that StaffPro successfully
estimates workers' attributes and generates high quality schedules. With its
innovative design, StaffPro offers a robust, interpretable, and human-centric
solution for automated personnel management.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities in large vision-language models (LVLMs) to harmful input, identifying three key safety capabilities. It proposes Self-Aware Safety Augmentation (SASA) to enhance safety without fine-tuning, showing significant improvements with minimal utility impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs are more vulnerable to harmful input than language-only models, prompting a study of their internal safety dynamics.

Method: Defines safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment as key capabilities, then introduces SASA to project semantic representations onto safety-oriented layers. Linear probing is used for risk detection.

Result: SASA significantly improves LVLM safety with minimal utility impact, as shown in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The study highlights LVLM safety vulnerabilities and offers a practical solution (SASA) to enhance safety while preserving model utility.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to harmful input compared
to their language-only backbones. We investigated this vulnerability by
exploring LVLMs internal dynamics, framing their inherent safety understanding
in terms of three key capabilities. Specifically, we define these capabilities
as safety perception, semantic understanding, and alignment for linguistic
expression, and experimentally pinpointed their primary locations within the
model architecture. The results indicate that safety perception often emerges
before comprehensive semantic understanding, leading to the reduction in
safety. Motivated by these findings, we propose \textbf{Self-Aware Safety
Augmentation (SASA)}, a technique that projects informative semantic
representations from intermediate layers onto earlier safety-oriented layers.
This approach leverages the model's inherent semantic understanding to enhance
safety recognition without fine-tuning. Then, we employ linear probing to
articulate the model's internal semantic comprehension to detect the risk
before the generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
tasks demonstrate that SASA significantly improves the safety of LVLMs, with
minimal impact on the utility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Assistax is a new RL benchmark for assistive robotics, offering faster training with JAX and multi-agent RL for diverse partner interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Games dominate RL benchmarks but lack real-world applicability, especially in embodied scenarios like assistive robotics.

Method: Assistax uses JAX for hardware acceleration, multi-agent RL for human-robot interaction, and provides baselines for continuous control algorithms.

Result: Assistax achieves up to 370x speed-up in training and establishes reliable baselines for RL in assistive robotics.

Conclusion: Assistax is a practical benchmark for advancing RL in assistive robotics, with open-source code available.

Abstract: The development of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been largely
driven by ambitious challenge tasks and benchmarks. Games have dominated RL
benchmarks because they present relevant challenges, are inexpensive to run and
easy to understand. While games such as Go and Atari have led to many
breakthroughs, they often do not directly translate to real-world embodied
applications. In recognising the need to diversify RL benchmarks and addressing
complexities that arise in embodied interaction scenarios, we introduce
Assistax: an open-source benchmark designed to address challenges arising in

*Mariam Alsayyad,Fayadh Kadhem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates AI's ability to manage a full college-level math course, highlighting strengths in organization and accuracy but noting limitations in emotional and human aspects. It suggests integrating human and AI efforts for better outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess AI's capability in handling a full college-level math course, including syllabus creation, material presentation, answering questions, and assessments.

Method: The study evaluates AI in four key aspects: syllabus creation, material presentation, answering student questions, and creating assessments.

Result: AI excels in organization and accuracy but lacks in emotional and human aspects, making it incomplete for full course management.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration is recommended to optimize the creation and management of a full college-level math course.

Abstract: This paper addresses the question of how able the current trends of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) are in managing to take the responsibility of a
full course of mathematics at a college level. The study evaluates this ability
in four significant aspects, namely, creating a course syllabus, presenting
selected material, answering student questions, and creating an assessment. It
shows that even though the AI is strong in some important parts like
organization and accuracy, there are still some human aspects that are far away
from the current abilities of AI. There is still a hidden emotional part, even
in science, that cannot be fulfilled by the AI in its current state. This paper
suggests some recommendations to integrate the human and AI potentials to
create better outcomes in terms of reaching the target of creating a full
course of mathematics, at a university level, as best as possible.

### [137] [Unrolling Dynamic Programming via Graph Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21705)
*Sergio Rozada,Samuel Rey,Gonzalo Mateos,Antonio G. Marques*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes BellNet, a learnable parametric model for solving Bellman's equations efficiently by unrolling policy iterations and leveraging graph signal processing insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard DP methods like policy iteration are computationally expensive for large state-action spaces or long-term dependencies.

Method: Unrolls and truncates policy iterations into BellNet, trained to minimize Bellman error, and re-parameterizes it as nonlinear graph filters.

Result: BellNet approximates optimal policies in fewer iterations than classical methods, as shown in grid-like environment experiments.

Conclusion: BellNet offers a concise, transferable, and efficient alternative to traditional DP methods.

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental tool used across many engineering
fields. The main goal of DP is to solve Bellman's optimality equations for a
given Markov decision process (MDP). Standard methods like policy iteration
exploit the fixed-point nature of these equations to solve them iteratively.
However, these algorithms can be computationally expensive when the
state-action space is large or when the problem involves long-term
dependencies. Here we propose a new approach that unrolls and truncates policy
iterations into a learnable parametric model dubbed BellNet, which we train to
minimize the so-termed Bellman error from random value function
initializations. Viewing the transition probability matrix of the MDP as the
adjacency of a weighted directed graph, we draw insights from graph signal
processing to interpret (and compactly re-parameterize) BellNet as a cascade of
nonlinear graph filters. This fresh look facilitates a concise, transferable,
and unifying representation of policy and value iteration, with an explicit
handle on complexity during inference. Preliminary experiments conducted in a
grid-like environment demonstrate that BellNet can effectively approximate
optimal policies in a fraction of the iterations required by classical methods.

*Jianfei Zhu,Haiqi Zhu,Shaohui Liu,Feng Jiang,Baichun Wei,Chunzhi Yi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GDAIP integrates Graph Attention Networks and Minimax Entropy-based domain adaptation to address domain shifts in cross-dataset fMRI brain parcellation, achieving topologically plausible and functionally consistent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with domain shifts in cross-dataset fMRI scenarios, limiting their effectiveness in real-world applications.

Method: Proposed GDAIP framework combines Graph Attention Networks and Minimax Entropy for domain adaptation, using semi-supervised training and adversarial optimization on unlabeled target data.

Result: GDAIP produces individual parcellations with plausible boundaries, cross-session consistency, and functional organization reflection.

Conclusion: GDAIP effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in fMRI brain parcellation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in learning such
individual brain parcellations from functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI). However, most existing methods assume consistent data distributions
across domains and struggle with domain shifts inherent to real-world
cross-dataset scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed Graph Domain
Adaptation for Individual Parcellation (GDAIP), a novel framework that
integrates Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with Minimax Entropy (MME)-based
domain adaptation. We construct cross-dataset brain graphs at both the group
and individual levels. By leveraging semi-supervised training and adversarial
optimization of the prediction entropy on unlabeled vertices from target brain
graph, the reference atlas is adapted from the group-level brain graph to the
individual brain graph, enabling individual parcellation under cross-dataset
settings. We evaluated our method using parcellation visualization, Dice
coefficient, and functional homogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that
GDAIP produces individual parcellations with topologically plausible
boundaries, strong cross-session consistency, and ability of reflecting
functional organization.

TL;DR: Bounded fitting for ALC and its fragments is NP-complete, even with minimal examples, and offers PAC learning guarantees. Other ALC learning methods lack such guarantees. A SAT-based implementation is presented and compared.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the computational complexity and learning guarantees of bounded fitting in description logic ALC and its fragments.

Method: Investigates NP-completeness of bounded fitting, contrasts with other ALC learning methods, and implements a SAT solver-based approach.

Result: Bounded fitting is NP-complete even with one positive and one negative example, and provides PAC guarantees. Other methods lack these guarantees.

Conclusion: Bounded fitting is a viable approach for learning ALC concepts with theoretical guarantees, and a SAT-based implementation is effective.

Abstract: Bounded fitting is a general paradigm for learning logical formulas from
positive and negative data examples, that has received considerable interest
recently. We investigate bounded fitting for the description logic ALC and its
syntactic fragments. We show that the underlying size-restricted fitting
problem is NP-complete for all studied fragments, even in the special case of a
single positive and a single negative example. By design, bounded fitting comes
with probabilistic guarantees in Valiant's PAC learning framework. In contrast,
we show that other classes of algorithms for learning ALC concepts do not
provide such guarantees. Finally, we present an implementation of bounded
fitting in ALC and its fragments based on a SAT solver. We discuss
optimizations and compare our implementation to other concept learning tools.

Result: Develops a comprehensive dataset and achieves precise performance measurements, enhancing the evaluation of RAG systems.

Conclusion: The study aims to improve the reliability and scalability of RAG system evaluations in industrial applications.

Abstract: The rise of generative AI, has driven significant advancements in high-risk
sectors like healthcare and finance. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

particularly notable for its ability to generate responses from document

### [141] [Hybrid Causal Identification and Causal Mechanism Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21792)
*Saixiong Liu,Yuhua Qian,Jue Li,Honghong Cheng,Feijiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces MCVCI and MCVCC methods for identifying heterogeneous causality in bivariate data, leveraging Gaussian mixture models and neural networks for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal methods often assume a single causal mechanism, but real-world data involves heterogeneous relationships. This paper addresses this gap.

Method: Proposes MCVCI, combining Gaussian mixture models and neural networks, and MCVCC for clustering causal mechanisms, using likelihoods from a mixture conditional variational auto-encoder.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real data, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively infer heterogeneous causality and reveal causal mechanisms, advancing causal inference.

Abstract: Bivariate causal direction identification is a fundamental and vital problem
in the causal inference field. Among binary causal methods, most methods based
on additive noise only use one single causal mechanism to construct a causal
model. In the real world, observations are always collected in different
environments with heterogeneous causal relationships. Therefore, on observation
data, this paper proposes a Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Inference
model (MCVCI) to infer heterogeneous causality. Specifically, according to the
identifiability of the Hybrid Additive Noise Model (HANM), MCVCI combines the
superior fitting capabilities of the Gaussian mixture model and the neural
network and elegantly uses the likelihoods obtained from the probabilistic
bounds of the mixture conditional variational auto-encoder as causal decision
criteria. Moreover, we model the casual heterogeneity into cluster numbers and
propose the Mixture Conditional Variational Causal Clustering (MCVCC) method,
which can reveal causal mechanism expression. Compared with state-of-the-art
methods, the comprehensive best performance demonstrates the effectiveness of
the methods proposed in this paper on several simulated and real data.

*Junzhe Li,Yutao Cui,Tao Huang,Yinping Ma,Chun Fan,Miles Yang,Zhao Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixGRPO improves efficiency in human preference alignment for image generation by integrating SDE and ODE sampling, reducing optimization overhead with a sliding window mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like FlowGRPO are inefficient due to sampling and optimizing all denoising steps in MDP.

Method: MixGRPO combines SDE and ODE sampling, using a sliding window for GRPO-guided optimization and ODE sampling outside. A faster variant, MixGRPO-Flash, supports higher-order solvers.

Result: MixGRPO reduces training time by 50% and outperforms DanceGRPO. MixGRPO-Flash further cuts training time by 71%.

Conclusion: MixGRPO offers a more efficient and effective framework for human preference alignment in image generation.

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at

TL;DR: A new agent-based approach for business process design using Agentic AI, focusing on goals, objects, and collaboration for flexible automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond traditional task-based business process design and enable more modular, intelligent, and context-aware automation in dynamic industrial settings.

Method: Proposes an agent-based method where agents work towards business goals, collaborating when necessary, and organizing processes around goals, objects, and agents.

Result: Leads to more modular, flexible, and context-aware business process development suitable for dynamic industrial environments.

Conclusion: The agent-based approach enhances automation by aligning it with business goals and enabling intelligent collaboration among agents.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence agents represent the next major revolution in the
continuous technological evolution of industrial automation. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach for business process design and development that
leverages the capabilities of Agentic AI. Departing from the traditional
task-based approach to business process design, we propose an agent-based
method, where agents contribute to the achievement of business goals,
identified by a set of business objects. When a single agent cannot fulfill a
goal, we have a merge goal that can be achieved through the collaboration of
multiple agents. The proposed model leads to a more modular and intelligent
business process development by organizing it around goals, objects, and
agents. As a result, this approach enables flexible and context-aware
automation in dynamic industrial environments.

*Kuiye Ding,Fanda Fan,Yao Wang,Ruijie jian,Xiaorui Wang,Luqi Gong,Yishan Jiang,Chunjie Luo an Jianfeng Zhan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualSG is a dual-stream framework using LLMs as semantic guides to refine traditional predictions, avoiding numerical precision loss and alignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods either lose numerical precision by treating LLMs as end-to-end forecasters or struggle with aligning textual and time series modalities.

Method: DualSG introduces Time Series Caption for explicit semantic guidance and a caption-guided fusion module to model inter-variable relationships.

Result: DualSG outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines across diverse real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance enhances performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting plays a key role in many applications.
Recent works have explored using Large Language Models for MTSF to take
advantage of their reasoning abilities. However, many methods treat LLMs as
end-to-end forecasters, which often leads to a loss of numerical precision and
forces LLMs to handle patterns beyond their intended design. Alternatively,
methods that attempt to align textual and time series modalities within latent
space frequently encounter alignment difficulty. In this paper, we propose to
treat LLMs not as standalone forecasters, but as semantic guidance modules
within a dual-stream framework. We propose DualSG, a dual-stream framework that
provides explicit semantic guidance, where LLMs act as Semantic Guides to
refine rather than replace traditional predictions. As part of DualSG, we
introduce Time Series Caption, an explicit prompt format that summarizes trend
patterns in natural language and provides interpretable context for LLMs,
rather than relying on implicit alignment between text and time series in the
latent space. We also design a caption-guided fusion module that explicitly
models inter-variable relationships while reducing noise and computation.
Experiments on real-world datasets from diverse domains show that DualSG
consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the value
of explicitly combining numerical forecasting with semantic guidance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Active Goal Recognition (AGR) using a probabilistic framework with joint belief updates and MCTS, showing superior performance over passive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve interaction in multi-agent systems by actively reducing uncertainty about other agents' goals.

Method: Combines joint belief updates with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for efficient planning and goal inference without domain-specific knowledge.

Result: Outperforms passive goal recognition; domain-independent MCTS matches domain-specific baselines.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, robust framework for goal inference, advancing interactive multi-agent systems.

Abstract: In multi-agent environments, effective interaction hinges on understanding
the beliefs and intentions of other agents. While prior work on goal
recognition has largely treated the observer as a passive reasoner, Active Goal
Recognition (AGR) focuses on strategically gathering information to reduce
uncertainty. We adopt a probabilistic framework for Active Goal Recognition and
propose an integrated solution that combines a joint belief update mechanism
with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, allowing the observer to plan
efficiently and infer the actor's hidden goal without requiring domain-specific
knowledge. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation in a grid-based domain,
we show that our joint belief update significantly outperforms passive goal
recognition, and that our domain-independent MCTS performs comparably to our
strong domain-specific greedy baseline. These results establish our solution as
a practical and robust framework for goal inference, advancing the field toward
more interactive and adaptive multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EDGE-GRPO, an algorithm addressing advantage collapse in LLMs by leveraging entropy-driven advantage and guided error correction, outperforming existing methods on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The GRPO algorithm's reliance on sparse rewards leads to identical rewards within groups, causing advantage collapse, which existing methods inadequately address.

Method: Proposes EDGE-GRPO, combining entropy-driven advantage and guided error correction to mitigate advantage collapse, analyzed at a fine-grained sample level.

Result: EDGE-GRPO effectively mitigates advantage collapse and demonstrates superior performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: EDGE-GRPO offers a robust solution to advantage collapse in LLMs, enhancing reasoning performance and outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in enhancing
step-by-step reasoning through reinforcement learning. However, the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, which relies on sparse reward
rules, often encounters the issue of identical rewards within groups, leading
to the advantage collapse problem. Existing works typically address this
challenge from two perspectives: enforcing model reflection to enhance response
diversity, and introducing internal feedback to augment the training signal
(advantage). In this work, we begin by analyzing the limitations of model
reflection and investigating the policy entropy of responses at the
fine-grained sample level. Based on our experimental findings, we propose the
EDGE-GRPO algorithm, which adopts \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{D}riven Advantage
and \textbf{G}uided \textbf{E}rror Correction to effectively mitigate the
problem of advantage collapse. Extensive experiments on several main reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach. It is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of long-tailed data distribution in autonomous driving, especially for rare but critical vehicle categories, to improve generalization.

Method: Proposes MultiEditor, leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting for structural and appearance priors, with multi-level appearance control and depth-guided cross-modality conditioning.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity reconstruction, superior editing controllability, and cross-modality consistency, boosting detection accuracy for rare classes.

Conclusion: MultiEditor effectively enhances multimodal data editing and perception model performance for underrepresented vehicle categories.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multimodal perception data to
understand complex environments. However, the long-tailed distribution of
real-world data hinders generalization, especially for rare but safety-critical
vehicle categories. To address this challenge, we propose MultiEditor, a
dual-branch latent diffusion framework designed to edit images and LiDAR point
clouds in driving scenarios jointly. At the core of our approach is introducing
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a structural and appearance prior for target
objects. Leveraging this prior, we design a multi-level appearance control
mechanism--comprising pixel-level pasting, semantic-level guidance, and
multi-branch refinement--to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction across
modalities. We further propose a depth-guided deformable cross-modality
condition module that adaptively enables mutual guidance between modalities
using 3DGS-rendered depth, significantly enhancing cross-modality consistency.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiEditor achieves superior
performance in visual and geometric fidelity, editing controllability, and
cross-modality consistency. Furthermore, generating rare-category vehicle data
with MultiEditor substantially enhances the detection accuracy of perception
models on underrepresented classes.

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework integrates GNNs into RBNs, combining GNNs' learning with RBNs' reasoning. Two implementations are developed, and MAP inference is proposed. Applications show improved accuracy and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between GNNs' predictive power and RBNs' symbolic reasoning, enabling richer modeling and inference on graph data.

Method: Two integration approaches: compiling GNNs into RBNs or keeping them external. A MAP inference method is introduced.

Result: Improved accuracy in node classification and enhanced decision-making in network optimization. New benchmark datasets are provided.

Conclusion: The framework successfully merges learning and reasoning, enabling novel applications and better performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at predictive tasks on graph-structured
data but often lack the ability to incorporate symbolic domain knowledge and
perform general reasoning. Relational Bayesian Networks (RBNs), in contrast,
enable fully generative probabilistic modeling over graph-like structures and
support rich symbolic knowledge and probabilistic inference. This paper
presents a neuro-symbolic framework that seamlessly integrates GNNs into RBNs,
combining the learning strength of GNNs with the flexible reasoning
capabilities of RBNs.
  We develop two implementations of this integration: one compiles GNNs
directly into the native RBN language, while the other maintains the GNN as an
external component. Both approaches preserve the semantics and computational
properties of GNNs while fully aligning with the RBN modeling paradigm. We also
propose a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) inference method for these neuro-symbolic
models.
  To demonstrate the framework's versatility, we apply it to two distinct
problems. First, we transform a GNN for node classification into a collective
classification model that explicitly models homo- and heterophilic label
patterns, substantially improving accuracy. Second, we introduce a
multi-objective network optimization problem in environmental planning, where
MAP inference supports complex decision-making. Both applications include new
publicly available benchmark datasets.
  This work introduces a powerful and coherent neuro-symbolic approach to graph
data, bridging learning and reasoning in ways that enable novel applications
and improved performance across diverse tasks.

Result: Respiration is effective for pain assessment; optimized compact models outperform larger ones.

Conclusion: The method enhances pain assessment by leveraging respiration and efficient modeling, improving representational capacity.

Abstract: Pain is a complex condition affecting a large portion of the population.
Accurate and consistent evaluation is essential for individuals experiencing
pain, and it supports the development of effective and advanced management
strategies. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and
support clinical decision-making, aiming to reduce distress and prevent
functional decline. This study has been submitted to the \textit{Second
Multimodal Sensing Grand Challenge for Next-Gen Pain Assessment (AI4PAIN)}. The
proposed method introduces a pipeline that leverages respiration as the input
signal and incorporates a highly efficient cross-attention transformer
alongside a multi-windowing strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
respiration is a valuable physiological modality for pain assessment. Moreover,
experiments revealed that compact and efficient models, when properly
optimized, can achieve strong performance, often surpassing larger
counterparts. The proposed multi-window approach effectively captures both
short-term and long-term features, as well as global characteristics, thereby
enhancing the model's representational capacity.

### [153] [LLM-based Content Classification Approach for GitHub Repositories by the README Files](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21899)
*Malik Uzair Mehmood,Shahid Hussain,Wen Li Wang,Muhammad Usama Malik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study fine-tunes LLMs (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) to classify GitHub README sections, achieving high accuracy (F1=0.98) and exploring cost-effective PEFT techniques like LoRA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GitHub README files often lack detail, hindering repository potential. Automating classification can improve repository usability and impact.

Method: Fine-tuned three encoder-only LLMs (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on 4226 README sections, tested PEFT techniques like LoRA.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 0.98, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. PEFT techniques showed economical alternatives with minimal performance loss.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively automate README classification, aiding repository improvement and broader adoption.

Abstract: GitHub is the world's most popular platform for storing, sharing, and
managing code. Every GitHub repository has a README file associated with it.
The README files should contain project-related information as per the
recommendations of GitHub to support the usage and improvement of repositories.
However, GitHub repository owners sometimes neglected these recommendations.
This prevents a GitHub repository from reaching its full potential. This
research posits that the comprehensiveness of a GitHub repository's README file
significantly influences its adoption and utilization, with a lack of detail
potentially hindering its full potential for widespread engagement and impact
within the research community. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great
performance in many text-based tasks including text classification, text
generation, text summarization and text translation. In this study, an approach
is developed to fine-tune LLMs for automatically classifying different sections
of GitHub README files. Three encoder-only LLMs are utilized, including BERT,
DistilBERT and RoBERTa. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned based on a
gold-standard dataset consisting of 4226 README file sections. This approach
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and has achieved an overall F1
score of 0.98. Moreover, we have also investigated the use of
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) and shown an economical alternative to full fine-tuning without
compromising much performance. The results demonstrate the potential of using
LLMs in designing an automatic classifier for categorizing the content of
GitHub README files. Consequently, this study contributes to the development of
automated tools for GitHub repositories to improve their identifications and
potential usages.

Conclusion: Libra-Guard and Libra-Test advance safety governance for Chinese LLMs, contributing to safer AI systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text understanding and generation but
raise significant safety and ethical concerns in high-stakes applications. To
mitigate these risks, we present Libra-Guard, a cutting-edge safeguard system
designed to enhance the safety of Chinese-based LLMs. Leveraging a two-stage

guard pretraining on synthetic samples, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality, real-world data, thereby significantly reducing reliance on
manual annotations. To enable rigorous safety evaluations, we also introduce
Libra-Test, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of safeguard systems for Chinese content. It covers seven
critical harm scenarios and includes over 5,700 samples annotated by domain
experts. Experiments show that Libra-Guard achieves 86.79% accuracy,
outperforming Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (74.33%) and ShieldLM-Qwen-14B-Chat
(65.69%), and nearing closed-source models like Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4o.
These contributions establish a robust framework for advancing the safety
governance of Chinese LLMs and represent a tentative step toward developing
safer, more reliable Chinese AI systems.

*Sourish Gunesh Dhekane,Thomas Ploetz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a zero-shot HAR method using natural language embeddings, avoiding LLM prompting risks like privacy and inconsistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address risks of LLM-based HAR methods (privacy, reliance, inconsistency) by developing an alternative approach.

Method: Models sensor data and activities with natural language embeddings for zero-shot classification.

Result: Detailed case study on six datasets demonstrates effectiveness of language modeling in zero-shot HAR.

Conclusion: Language modeling offers a viable alternative to LLM prompting for zero-shot HAR, mitigating associated risks.

Abstract: Developing zero-shot human activity recognition (HAR) methods is a critical
direction in smart home research -- considering its impact on making HAR
systems work across smart homes having diverse sensing modalities, layouts, and
activities of interest. The state-of-the-art solutions along this direction are
based on generating natural language descriptions of the sensor data and
feeding it via a carefully crafted prompt to the LLM to perform classification.
Despite their performance guarantees, such ``prompt-the-LLM'' approaches carry
several risks, including privacy invasion, reliance on an external service, and
inconsistent predictions due to version changes, making a case for alternative
zero-shot HAR methods that do not require prompting the LLMs. In this paper, we
propose one such solution that models sensor data and activities using natural
language, leveraging its embeddings to perform zero-shot classification and
thereby bypassing the need to prompt the LLMs for activity predictions. The
impact of our work lies in presenting a detailed case study on six datasets,
highlighting how language modeling can bolster HAR systems in zero-shot
recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCA in mobile networks is challenging due to interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning requirements.

Method: A two-stage training methodology combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to adapt LLMs for RCA, using the TeleLogs dataset.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, showing significant performance gains and strong generalization.

Conclusion: Domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs hold promise for practical and explainable RCA in network operations.

Abstract: Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in mobile networks remains a challenging task due
to the need for interpretability, domain expertise, and causal reasoning. In
this work, we propose a lightweight framework that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) for RCA. To do so, we introduce TeleLogs, a curated dataset of
annotated troubleshooting problems designed to benchmark RCA capabilities. Our
evaluation reveals that existing open-source reasoning LLMs struggle with these
problems, underscoring the need for domain-specific adaptation. To address this
issue, we propose a two-stage training methodology that combines supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning to improve the accuracy and reasoning
quality of LLMs. The proposed approach fine-tunes a series of RCA models to
integrate domain knowledge and generate structured, multi-step diagnostic
explanations, improving both interpretability and effectiveness. Extensive
experiments across multiple LLM sizes show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art reasoning and non-reasoning models, including strong
generalization to randomized test variants. These results demonstrate the
promise of domain-adapted, reasoning-enhanced LLMs for practical and
explainable RCA in network operation and management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have high computational costs, requiring efficient compression for medical use.

Method: Proposes a layer selection method for pruning, analyzes quantization techniques, and tests a prune-SFT-quantize pipeline.

Result: Enables 7B-parameter MLLMs to run in 4GB VRAM, reducing memory by 70% and improving performance by 4%.

Conclusion: The method effectively compresses MLLMs for medical applications, balancing memory and performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold huge potential for usage in the
medical domain, but their computational costs necessitate efficient compression
techniques. This paper evaluates the impact of structural pruning and
activation-aware quantization on a fine-tuned LLAVA model for medical

*Bahar İlgen,Akshat Dubey,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PHAX is a framework for generating human-centered AI explanations in public health, using structured argumentation to enhance transparency and trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI methods lack adaptability for diverse health stakeholders, necessitating clearer, context-aware explanations.

Method: PHAX combines defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user modeling to create audience-specific justifications.

Result: PHAX improves interpretability and trust through use cases like medical term simplification and policy justification.

Conclusion: PHAX advances transparent, human-centered AI in public health by aligning formal reasoning with communicative needs.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in AI-driven public health and biomedical
sciences systems requires more than accurate predictions-it demands
explanations that are clear, contextual, and socially accountable. While
explainable AI (XAI) has advanced in areas like feature attribution and model
interpretability, most methods still lack the structure and adaptability needed
for diverse health stakeholders, including clinicians, policymakers, and the
general public. We introduce PHAX-a Public Health Argumentation and
eXplainability framework-that leverages structured argumentation to generate
human-centered explanations for AI outputs. PHAX is a multi-layer architecture
combining defeasible reasoning, adaptive natural language techniques, and user
modeling to produce context-aware, audience-specific justifications. More
specifically, we show how argumentation enhances explainability by supporting
AI-driven decision-making, justifying recommendations, and enabling interactive
dialogues across user types. We demonstrate the applicability of PHAX through
use cases such as medical term simplification, patient-clinician communication,
and policy justification. In particular, we show how simplification decisions
can be modeled as argument chains and personalized based on user
expertise-enhancing both interpretability and trust. By aligning formal
reasoning methods with communicative demands, PHAX contributes to a broader
vision of transparent, human-centered AI in public health.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UI-AGILE enhances GUI agents with improved training (Continuous Reward, Simple Thinking reward, Cropping-based Resampling) and inference (Decomposed Grounding with Selection) methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing GUI agent training and inference, such as ineffective rewards and visual noise, to improve reasoning and grounding accuracy.

Method: Proposes Continuous Reward, Simple Thinking reward, and Cropping-based Resampling for training; Decomposed Grounding with Selection for inference.

Result: Achieves 23% grounding accuracy improvement over baselines on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Conclusion: UI-AGILE significantly advances GUI agent capabilities with its comprehensive framework.

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

TL;DR: UserBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in multi-turn, preference-driven interactions, revealing gaps in proactive collaboration and user alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study addresses the underexplored ability of LLM agents to collaborate proactively with users, especially when goals are vague or evolving.

Method: UserBench introduces simulated users with underspecified goals, requiring agents to clarify intent and use tools effectively.

Result: Evaluation shows LLMs align with user intents only 20% of the time and uncover fewer than 30% of preferences, highlighting collaboration challenges.

Conclusion: UserBench provides a tool to measure and improve LLM agents' collaborative capabilities, emphasizing the need for better user-aligned models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores socially mediated learning for LLMs, introducing an 'AI Social Gym' where AI learners interact with teacher agents. Dialogic methods, especially mixed-direction interactions, enhance knowledge acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with online knowledge integration. Traditional training paradigms are limited by sparse feedback and large datasets. Sociocultural theory inspires a solution.

Method: An 'AI Social Gym' environment is created for dyadic pedagogical dialogues between AI learners and teachers, focusing on structured dialogue for knowledge acquisition.

Result: Mixed-direction interactions (top-down explanations with learner-initiated questioning) outperform unidirectional methods and direct access to structured knowledge.

Conclusion: Integrating pedagogical insights into AI training improves post-training knowledge acquisition and response quality, complementing existing strategies like prompt engineering.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EFL students' editing of AI-generated text shows minimal impact on writing quality, despite significant effort. AI aids but doesn't replace writing skills, emphasizing the need for genre-specific instruction and process-focused assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how EFL students edit AI-generated text and its impact on their expository writing quality.

Method: Analyzed screen recordings and compositions of 39 Hong Kong secondary students using qualitative coding, descriptive statistics, temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression.

Result: Students made over 260 edits, with two editing patterns identified. AI-generated words positively predicted scores, but editing efforts had minimal impact.

Conclusion: AI supports writing but doesn't replace skills. Genre-specific instruction and process-focused assessments are crucial for effective AI integration in EFL writing.

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge existing solutions to the grounding problem and propose a redefinition focusing on computational agents.

Method: Critique of Floridi and Taddeo's condition, analysis of Luc Steels' approach, and rethinking the grounding problem's formulation.

Result: Floridi and Taddeo's condition is unfulfillable; the grounding problem should focus on explaining meaning in computational agents.

Conclusion: The grounding problem should be redefined to address behavioral meaning in artificial computational agents.

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4's responses are influenced by the emotional tone of prompts, showing a rebound bias toward neutrality or positivity, especially on sensitive topics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how emotional framing in prompts affects GPT-4's responses and identify biases.

Method: Systematically varied emotional tone in 156 prompts, analyzed responses, and introduced metrics like 'tone floor' and transition matrices.

Result: GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to negative prompts, with stronger effects on sensitive topics.

Conclusion: Emotional framing introduces biases, impacting AI alignment and trust; tools like tone-valence matrices help quantify behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are

*Aly M. Kassem,Zhuan Shi,Negar Rostamzadeh,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MNEME is a lightweight framework using sparse model diffing to detect unintended side effects in LLMs after fine-tuning or unlearning, achieving high accuracy without custom heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack a general approach to detect unpredictable side effects in LLMs post-intervention.

Method: MNEME compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data to isolate behavioral shifts.

Result: MNEME achieves up to 95% accuracy in predicting side effects and can partially reverse effects by retraining on high-activation samples.

Conclusion: Sparse probing and diffing provide scalable tools for understanding and managing LLM behavior changes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for

### [168] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MACD extends Contrastive Decoding by using multiple amateur models to better address diverse language generation failures, improving fluency, coherence, and adaptability without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single amateur models in Contrastive Decoding limit the ability to capture varied generation failures like repetition and hallucination.

Method: MACD employs an ensemble of amateur models, integrates contrastive signals via averaging and consensus penalization, and extends plausibility constraints.

Result: MACD outperforms conventional decoding and original CD in fluency, coherence, diversity, and adaptability across multiple domains.

Conclusion: MACD is a more effective and flexible approach for open-ended text generation, enhancing performance without additional training.

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a feature-augmented transformer architecture for subjectivity detection in news sentences, combining pre-trained language models with statistical and linguistic features. It achieves competitive results across multiple languages, including zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing subjective from objective views in news sentences, leveraging both contextual and linguistic features for improved performance.

Method: A feature-augmented transformer architecture combining pre-trained language models (AraELECTRA for Arabic, DeBERTa~V3 for others) with lexical features (POS tags, TF-IDF) and a gating mechanism. Evaluated in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.

Result: Competitive performance across languages, with top rankings in English, German, Arabic, and Romanian. Ablation analysis highlights the importance of TF-IDF features, gating, and cross-lingual transfer.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines contextual and linguistic features for subjectivity detection, with cross-lingual transfer and feature integration being key to success.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how LLM-based rewriting of ads improves their ranking and inclusion in LLM responses without altering the retrieval model. It introduces a fine-tuning framework and metrics (DeltaMRR@K, DeltaDIR@K) to measure effectiveness, showing PPO-trained models outperform other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of ad phrasing on visibility in LLM retrieval systems is underexplored. The study aims to enhance ad ranking and inclusion without modifying the retrieval model.

Method: A supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing semantic relevance and content fidelity is introduced. Metrics DeltaMRR@K and DeltaDIR@K evaluate ranking and inclusion improvements. PPO-trained models are compared to prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning.

Result: PPO-trained models achieve up to 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in instruction-based prompting, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: Ad phrasing and reinforcement learning significantly impact visibility in LLM-integrated retrieval systems, with PPO-trained models proving most effective.

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

Motivation: To address the lack of localized datasets for sign language translation, which is crucial for developing tools to improve accessibility and inclusion.

Method: Creation of the iLSU T dataset with over 185 hours of interpreted sign language videos, followed by experiments using three translation algorithms to establish a baseline.

Result: The dataset and proposed pipeline are validated, emphasizing the need for localized datasets in sign language processing.

Conclusion: iLSU T is a valuable resource for advancing sign language translation and understanding, promoting accessibility and inclusion.

Abstract: Automatic sign language translation has gained particular interest in the
computer vision and computational linguistics communities in recent years.
Given each sign language country particularities, machine translation requires
local data to develop new techniques and adapt existing ones. This work
presents iLSU T, an open dataset of interpreted Uruguayan Sign Language RGB
videos with audio and text transcriptions. This type of multimodal and curated
data is paramount for developing novel approaches to understand or generate

topics and includes the participation of 18 professional interpreters of sign
language. A series of experiments using three state of the art translation
algorithms is presented. The aim is to establish a baseline for this dataset
and evaluate its usefulness and the proposed pipeline for data processing. The
experiments highlight the need for more localized datasets for sign language
translation and understanding, which are critical for developing novel tools to
improve accessibility and inclusion of all individuals. Our data and code can

*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study aims to objectively measure Arabic rhetoric's density in texts by identifying and quantifying literary devices, providing tools for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite Arabic rhetoric's importance, there's no objective way to measure its use or compare it across genres, authors, or periods.

Method: Compiled 84 literary devices, created identification systems, and developed tools (including a website) to calculate rhetorical density based on morpheme count.

Result: Produced a tool that accurately measures Arabic rhetoric density in texts, including device distribution across sub-domains.

Conclusion: The study successfully created an objective method to analyze and compare Arabic rhetoric in texts, filling a critical gap in the field.

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curved Inference tracks residual stream trajectories in LLMs to analyze semantic shifts. Metrics like curvature and salience reveal how models respond to varied prompts, showing distinct behaviors in LLaMA and Gemma.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally process and respond to shifts in semantic concerns, providing insights into model alignment and abstraction.

Method: Analyzed Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using curvature and salience metrics under a pullback semantic metric across 20 diverse prompts.

Result: LLaMA showed consistent scaling in curvature and salience with concern intensity, while Gemma responded but with weaker differentiation.

Conclusion: Curved Inference offers a principled way to diagnose LLM alignment and abstraction, revealing how models navigate semantic meaning.

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

TL;DR: SemRAG is an enhanced RAG framework integrating domain-specific knowledge via semantic chunking and knowledge graphs, avoiding costly fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving LLM performance in specialized tasks without computational expense or overfitting risks.

Method: Uses semantic chunking based on cosine similarity and knowledge graphs for structured retrieval.

Result: Outperforms traditional RAG in relevance and correctness, with optimized buffer sizes enhancing performance.

Conclusion: SemRAG offers a scalable, efficient solution for domain-specific LLM applications, aligning with sustainability.

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

Motivation: Traditional insurance companies seek to leverage InsurTech and NLP to maintain competitiveness by enriching data sources and improving decision-making.

Method: The study applies NLP techniques to unstructured text from InsurTech data, demonstrating practical use cases in commercial insurance.

Result: NLP-derived insights refine pricing factors and introduce novel risk assessment perspectives, proving NLP's foundational role in insurance analytics.

Conclusion: NLP is essential for modern, data-driven insurance operations, offering transformative potential beyond supplementary use.

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trident-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating domain-specific safety of LLMs in law, finance, and medicine, revealing gaps in ethical compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic evaluation of domain-specific safety risks in LLMs deployed in high-risk domains like law, finance, and medicine.

Method: Defined domain-specific safety principles based on professional ethics codes and introduced Trident-Bench to evaluate 19 LLMs.

Result: Generalist models meet basic safety expectations, while domain-specialized models struggle with ethical nuances, highlighting the need for finer-grained safety improvements.

Conclusion: Trident-Bench is a foundational resource for studying LLM safety in regulated fields, paving the way for future research to mitigate deployment risks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the most effective way of leveraging diversity (model vs. question interpretation) for improving performance in binary question answering with LLMs.

Method: Compared two diversity approaches: model diversity (multiple models) and question interpretation diversity (same model, different question framings). Used majority voting for consensus.

Result: Question interpretation diversity consistently achieved better ensemble accuracy. Model diversity results were between the best and worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

Conclusion: Question interpretation diversity is more effective than model diversity for enhancing binary question answering performance with LLMs.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Contrast-CAT improves interpretability of transformer-based text classification by filtering class-irrelevant features, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explaining transformer decisions is challenging, and existing methods are unreliable due to class-irrelevant features in activations.

Method: Proposes Contrast-CAT, an activation contrast-based attribution method that contrasts input and reference activations to filter irrelevant features.

Result: Contrast-CAT outperforms competing methods, with significant improvements in AOPC and LOdds metrics.

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT enhances interpretability for transformer-based text classification by providing clearer and more faithful attribution maps.

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze evolving public perception of crime-related news through sentiment analysis of Bangla social media comments.

Method: A newly curated dataset of 28,528 Bangla comments was used. The proposed transformer-based model employs XLM-RoBERTa Base and explainable AI for interpretability.

Result: The model achieves 97% classification accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Transformer-based models are effective for low-resource languages like Bengali and can aid public policy and crime prevention.

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

TL;DR: The paper fine-tunes Bangla BERT to detect hyperpartisan news, achieving 95.65% accuracy and outperforming traditional methods, while using LIME for explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misinformation in Bangla lacks detection tools, risking societal divisions. The study aims to fill this gap with advanced NLP methods.

Method: Fine-tuned Bangla BERT, compared it to traditional models, and used semi-supervised learning and LIME for explainability.

Result: Bangla BERT achieved 95.65% accuracy, surpassing conventional approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer models like Bangla BERT are effective even in low-resource settings, paving the way for further advancements.

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

TL;DR: Clinical rationales as additional training data improve model performance in high-resource settings but are inconsistent in low-resource scenarios. Using more reports outperforms rationale-based training for accuracy, while rationales slightly enhance explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if human-based clinical rationales can enhance performance and explainability of transformer-based models for clinical text classification.

Method: Analyzed 99,125 clinical rationales alongside 128,649 pathology reports to train transformer models, evaluating performance and rationale quality using sufficiency.

Result: Rationales improve performance in high-resource settings but are inconsistent otherwise. Models trained on reports outperform rationale-trained models in accuracy. Rationales slightly improve explainability.

Conclusion: For accuracy, labeling more reports is better than creating rationales. For explainability, rationale-supplemented training may help, but gains are modest.

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

### [184] [Do Large Language Models Understand Morality Across Cultures?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21319)
*Hadi Mohammadi,Yasmeen F. S. S. Meijer,Efthymia Papadopoulou,Ayoub Bagheri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines how well large language models (LLMs) capture cross-cultural moral differences, finding they often fail to align with empirical survey data, highlighting biases and the need for improved cultural representativeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about biases in LLMs, especially regarding gender, racial, and cultural biases, prompt an investigation into their ability to reflect cross-cultural moral perspectives.

Method: Three methods are used: comparing moral score variances, cluster alignment analyses, and direct probing with comparative prompts.

Result: LLMs often compress cross-cultural moral differences and show low alignment with survey data, indicating biases and lack of cultural representativeness.

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for better bias mitigation and cultural representativeness in LLMs, emphasizing ethical development and global fairness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

TL;DR: A deep learning-based ASR system for Shona, a low-resource language, achieved 74% accuracy using hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, data augmentation, and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of limited training data, lack of labeled data, and tonal complexities in Shona speech to improve ASR accuracy over traditional models.

Method: Hybrid CNN for acoustic modeling and LSTM for language modeling, with data augmentation, transfer learning, and attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieved 29% WER, 12% PER, and 74% accuracy, outperforming statistical models.

Conclusion: Deep learning enhances ASR for low-resource languages like Shona, improving accessibility and communication.

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

*Satyananda Kashyap,Sola Shirai,Nandana Mihindukulasooriya,Horst Samulowitz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StructText is a framework for automatically generating benchmarks for key-value extraction from text using tabular data, addressing the lack of scalable evaluation benchmarks for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' extraction quality in specific domains or organizational contexts, coupled with the labor-intensive nature of manual annotation, drives the need for an automated solution.

Method: StructText uses a two-stage 'plan-then-execute' pipeline to generate synthetic natural-language text from tabular data, with multi-dimensional evaluation combining LLM-based judgments and objective extraction metrics.

Result: Evaluation on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets shows LLMs achieve high factual accuracy but struggle with narrative coherence, making extraction challenging despite accurate numerical and temporal information.

Conclusion: StructText provides a scalable framework for benchmark generation, with released datasets, tools, and baselines to support further research in key-value extraction.

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

*Xiyue Zhu,Peng Tang,Haofu Liao,Srikar Appalaraju*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel web history compressor improves web automation by distilling task-relevant history states into fixed-length representations, achieving 1.2-5.4% accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web automation methods ignore history states, leading to sparse information and long input sequences, which hampers performance.

Method: Proposes a history compressor module to distill task-relevant information from verbose history states into short, fixed-length representations.

Result: Experiments on Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets show 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements over baselines without history inputs.

Conclusion: The history compressor effectively enhances web automation by leveraging condensed history states.

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

*Elias Lumer,Anmol Gulati,Vamse Kumar Subbiah,Pradeep Honaganahalli Basavaraju,James A. Burke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemTool is a framework for LLM agents to manage tools/MCP contexts in multi-turn conversations, offering three modes (Autonomous, Workflow, Hybrid) with trade-offs in efficiency and task completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed context windows limit LLM agents' effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated tool usage.

Method: MemTool introduces three agentic architectures: Autonomous Agent Mode, Workflow Mode, and Hybrid Mode, evaluated on 13+ LLMs using the ScaleMCP benchmark.

Result: Autonomous Mode shows high tool-removal efficiency for reasoning LLMs (90-94%), while Workflow and Hybrid modes manage tool removal effectively. Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion.

Conclusion: MemTool provides flexible modes for tool management, with recommendations based on task accuracy, agency, and model capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

TL;DR: The study introduces LiTransMC, a fine-tuned causal LLM for travel mode choice prediction, outperforming proprietary models and classical methods while offering interpretability and local deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a locally deployable, interpretable LLM for travel mode choice prediction, addressing gaps in predictive accuracy and behavioral alignment.

Method: Benchmarked 11 LLMs across datasets, fine-tuned LiTransMC with parameter-efficient strategies, and evaluated reasoning using BERTopic and a novel Explanation Strength Index.

Result: LiTransMC achieved superior accuracy (F1: 0.6845) and calibration (JSD: 0.000245), surpassing GPT-4o and classical methods.

Conclusion: Specialist LLMs like LiTransMC can integrate prediction and interpretability, enabling applications in transport research and policy while ensuring privacy and cost-efficiency.

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HumorBench is a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' humor reasoning in cartoon captions, revealing insights about STEM reasoning transfer and model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge LLMs beyond STEM domains by assessing their humor comprehension, which involves complex reasoning and cultural references.

Method: Uses 300 cartoon-caption pairs with expert annotations; evaluates LLMs on humor explanation and joke element identification.

Result: STEM reasoning transfers well to humor; models trained on STEM data perform strongly; thinking token scaling has mixed effects.

Conclusion: HumorBench highlights the transferability of reasoning skills and the need for diverse evaluations of LLM intelligence.

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

*Abhinav Arabelly,Jagrut Nemade,Robert D Nowak,Jifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a label-efficient learning method for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging task-diversity for data selection, reducing annotation costs by up to 80% while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing LLMs for specialized applications require costly human annotation. The paper aims to address this by proposing a more efficient data selection method.

Method: Uses task-diversity and inverse confidence weighting to select examples, differing from prompt-diversity methods.

Result: Achieves better accuracy (4% increase in MMLU score) and reduces annotation costs by up to 80%.

Conclusion: The proposed method is simpler, more efficient, and outperforms existing approaches in label-efficient learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces VN-MTEB, a Vietnamese benchmark for embedding models, created by translating English samples from MTEB using LLMs and advanced embedding models. It includes 41 datasets for six tasks and shows that complex models with Rotary Positional Embedding outperform simpler ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vietnam faces high online toxicity and lacks large-scale test datasets for evaluating AI models in real-world applications.

Method: The authors translated English samples from MTEB using LLMs and embedding models, ensuring language quality and semantic fidelity. The benchmark includes 41 datasets for six tasks.

Result: Bigger, more complex models with Rotary Positional Embedding perform better than those with Absolute Positional Embedding.

Conclusion: VN-MTEB addresses the lack of Vietnamese test datasets and aids in evaluating embedding models effectively.

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'persona vectors' in large language models to monitor and control personality traits like evil, sycophancy, and hallucination, offering methods to mitigate or prevent undesirable shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address deviations from helpful, harmless, and honest behavior in AI assistants by understanding and controlling underlying personality traits.

Method: Extracts persona vectors from activation space to monitor and predict personality shifts, with interventions like post-hoc mitigation and preventative steering.

Result: Persona vectors correlate with personality changes during training, enabling mitigation and prevention of undesirable traits.

Conclusion: Automated persona vector extraction can monitor and control AI personality traits, improving alignment with desired behaviors.

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Token Map Drafting accelerates ASR inference by using a precomputed n-gram token map, eliminating the need for a draft model, achieving speed-ups without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding in transformer-based ASR systems is computationally expensive, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices. Speculative decoding (SD) requires hardware accelerators, making it impractical for some devices.

Method: Proposes Token Map Drafting, a model-free SD technique using a precomputed n-gram token map from domain-specific data to enable efficient speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves speed-ups of 1.27x and 1.37x on datasets without accuracy loss, and a 10% improvement over Distill-spec on CPU.

Conclusion: Token Map Drafting is effective for on-device ASR, offering significant speed improvements without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

*Zhiyuan He,Yike Zhang,Chengruidong Zhang,Huiqiang Jiang,Yuqing Yang,Lili Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriangleMix is a training-free static attention pattern that reduces computational overhead in LLMs by combining dense and sparse attention, improving efficiency without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational bottlenecks of quadratic time complexity in LLM attention mechanisms, overcoming limitations of existing sparse methods.

Method: Proposes TriangleMix, which uses dense attention in shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper layers.

Result: Reduces attention overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers and decreases TTFT by 12% to 32% for long sequences, maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: TriangleMix enhances LLM inference efficiency and can integrate with dynamic sparsity for further speedup.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper replicates and extends an NLP4RE study, evaluating deep learning models for requirement classification, and introduces GPT-4o for comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To strengthen the external validity of NLP4RE studies and explore new opportunities with advanced NLP techniques.

Method: Reproduced the baseline study using its source code, extended it with an external dataset and GPT-4o zero-shot classifier, and assessed replication readiness.

Result: Naive Bayes showed perfect reproducibility, while BERT and ELMo generalized well. GPT-4o matched traditional models. Replication readiness was confirmed but lacked environment setup files.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of replication in NLP4RE, provides missing setup details, and encourages future replications with its ID-card and package.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

TL;DR: The study introduces a tailored dependency annotation framework for Uyghur NLP, addressing gaps in existing treebanks, and validates its necessity through cross-standard evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing treebanks for Uyghur, a low-resource, agglutinative language, by providing a more accurate and semantically transparent representation.

Method: Developed a dependency annotation framework with 18 main relations and 26 subtypes, validated using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser.

Result: A 47.9% divergence in annotations was found, highlighting the inadequacy of universal schemes for Uyghur-specific structures.

Conclusion: The Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) offers a replicable model for morphologically complex languages, improving parsing and downstream NLP tasks.

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

### [198] [MAGIC: A Multi-Hop and Graph-Based Benchmark for Inter-Context Conflicts in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21544)
*Jungyeon Lee,Kangmin Lee,Taeuk Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a KG-based framework, MAGIC, to address limitations in existing benchmarks for knowledge conflict in RAG systems, revealing LLMs' struggles with conflict detection and resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for knowledge conflict in RAG systems are limited in scope and methodology, prompting the need for a more comprehensive and interpretable approach.

Method: A knowledge graph (KG)-based framework is proposed to generate varied and subtle conflicts, leveraging KG's relational structure for interpretability.

Result: LLMs, both open-source and proprietary, struggle with detecting and resolving conflicts, particularly in multi-hop reasoning scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides foundational insights for improving LLMs' ability to integrate diverse and conflicting information.

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

### [199] [Evaluating the cognitive reality of Spanish irregular morphomic patterns: Humans vs. Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21556)
*Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao,Kevin Tang,Dinah Baer-Henney*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares transformer-based neural networks to human data in replicating sensitivity to Spanish irregular morphomic patterns, finding model-human divergences in response preferences and phonological sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if transformer models can mimic human-like sensitivity to complex linguistic phenomena (morphomes) under controlled conditions.

Method: Using the same framework as a human study, models were tested on three frequency conditions (natural, low, high) of irregular verb distributions.

Result: Models outperformed humans in accuracy but diverged in response preferences, favoring irregular responses and showing phonological sensitivity in certain training conditions.

Conclusion: Transformer models exhibit different behavioral patterns compared to humans, influenced by training data distributions and phonological factors.

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

### [200] [Multi-Hypothesis Distillation of Multilingual Neural Translation Models for Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21568)
*Aarón Galiano-Jiménez,Juan Antonio Pérez-Ortiz,Felipe Sánchez-Martínez,Víctor M. Sánchez-Cartagena*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a sequence-level knowledge distillation method for multilingual translation models, leveraging multiple teacher-generated translations to improve student learning and reduce bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance student model performance by capturing more of the teacher model's output distribution, beyond beam search approximations, and to mitigate issues like low variability and gender bias.

Method: Proposes MHD, which generates multiple translations per source sentence using n-best lists from beam search and explores alternative decoding methods for richer output.

Result: For low-resource languages, sampling methods increase variability and lexical richness, improving student performance and reducing gender bias, despite slight quality trade-offs.

Conclusion: MHD effectively broadens the teacher's distribution representation, enhancing student learning and addressing biases, making it valuable for multilingual translation tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

baselines and achieves consistent performance across both monolingual and
cross-lingual settings. While not the primary focus, we also show that the
model can be effectively used to rank relevant skills for a given job title,
demonstrating its broader applicability in multilingual labor market
intelligence. The model is publicly available:

*Meng Zhou,Bei Li,Jiahao Liu,Xiaowen Shi,Yang Bai,Rongxiang Weng,Jingang Wang,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to enhance reward models in RL for reasoning tasks, addressing limitations of current methods. It proposes a benchmark (Libra Bench) and a novel approach (Libra-RM) for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models in RL for reasoning tasks underperform and rely on rule-based or reference-based rewards, limiting scalability and performance.

Method: Proposes a reasoning-oriented benchmark (Libra Bench) and a novel approach (learning-to-think) to improve generative reward models (Libra-RM).

Result: Libra-RM achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and shows potential for improving reasoning models with unlabeled data.

Conclusion: The framework and Libra-RM address key limitations, enabling better scaling and performance in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

### [203] [UnsafeChain: Enhancing Reasoning Model Safety via Hard Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21652)
*Raj Vardhan Tomar,Preslav Nakov,Yuxia Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UnsafeChain is a dataset for safety alignment in large reasoning models, focusing on hard prompts that elicit harmful outputs. It corrects unsafe responses into safe ones, improving model safety without compromising reasoning ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment methods overlook hard prompts that consistently produce harmful outputs, creating a gap in ensuring model safety.

Method: UnsafeChain is constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, identifying and correcting unsafe completions. Three LRMs are fine-tuned on this dataset and evaluated against benchmarks.

Result: UnsafeChain outperforms prior datasets, with even a small subset matching or surpassing baseline performance, showing effectiveness in correction-based supervision.

Conclusion: UnsafeChain effectively enhances safety alignment in LRMs while maintaining reasoning capabilities, demonstrating generalizability and outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and
code at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/UnsafeChain

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Yizhi Li,Stuart E. Middleton,Noura Al Moubayed,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple add-on module improves adversarial robustness of pre-trained language models by removing instance-level principal components, avoiding costly adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defenses are computationally expensive.

Method: The proposed method transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, reducing susceptibility to adversarial perturbations without altering training data.

Result: Evaluations on eight datasets show improved robustness while maintaining baseline accuracy, balancing robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: The approach offers an effective, low-cost solution to enhance PLM robustness against adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgriEval is a new Chinese agricultural benchmark for evaluating LLMs, covering six categories and 29 subcategories with diverse question formats. Most LLMs perform poorly, highlighting the need for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of training data and benchmarks for LLMs in agriculture prompted the creation of AgriEval to evaluate and enhance model performance.

Method: AgriEval includes 14,697 multiple-choice and 2,167 open-ended questions from university-level sources, testing memorization, understanding, inference, and generation.

Result: Most LLMs scored below 60% accuracy, indicating significant room for improvement in agricultural applications.

Conclusion: AgriEval fills a critical gap in agricultural LLM evaluation and provides a foundation for future advancements in the field.

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

### [206] [The Problem with Safety Classification is not just the Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21782)
*Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights multilingual disparities in safety classifiers for LLMs and identifies issues with evaluation datasets, advocating for better methods to detect harmful content across languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on evaluating safety classifiers for LLMs, especially in multilingual contexts, and to uncover issues in evaluation datasets.

Method: Analyzed 5 safety classification models using datasets covering 18 languages to identify multilingual disparities and dataset shortcomings.

Result: Found disparities in model performance across languages and issues with evaluation datasets, suggesting problems extend beyond the models themselves.

Conclusion: Calls for improved methods to evaluate and develop safety classifiers for detecting harmful content in LLMs across diverse languages.

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chart annotation representations are fragmented and non-standardized, limiting accessibility and reuse.

Method: Proposes ChartMark, a hierarchical framework mapping annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context) to support abstract intents and visual details.

Result: Demonstrates ChartMark's flexibility and expressiveness by converting its specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations.

Conclusion: ChartMark offers a practical solution for standardized, reusable chart annotations.

Abstract: Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from
fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse.
We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics
from visualization implementations. ChartMark features a hierarchical framework
mapping onto annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context), supporting both

*Kaixuan Wang,Chenxin Diao,Jason T. Jacques,Zhongliang Guo,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRIPBench evaluates LLMs' accuracy and safety in harm reduction information, revealing risks and inaccuracies in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' capability and safety in providing harm reduction information for people who use drugs (PWUD).

Method: Developed HRIPBench with 2,160 question-answer-evidence pairs, testing tasks like safety boundaries and polysubstance use risks. Evaluated LLMs using Instruction and RAG schemes.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs often provide inaccurate harm reduction info and pose safety risks to PWUD.

Conclusion: LLMs in harm reduction must be used cautiously to avoid negative health outcomes.

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

*Anna Golub,Beate Zywietz,Annerose Eichel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of assessing changes in plausibility due to event modification, using the ADEPT benchmark. It introduces a novel method with sentence transformers but finds they underperform compared to models like RoBERTa. The study emphasizes the need for balanced evaluation methods to avoid distorted results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding plausibility changes is crucial for tasks like dialogue generation and commonsense reasoning, as it helps model nuances like sarcasm accurately.

Method: The study uses the ADEPT benchmark with 16K sentence pairs modified by one adjective. It employs sentence transformers and compares their performance to transformer-based models like RoBERTa.

Result: Sentence transformers underperform compared to models like RoBERTa, despite their conceptual alignment with the task. The study also highlights issues with imbalanced evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The paper underscores the need for realistic, balanced evaluation methods to ensure trustworthy results and better model performance in plausibility assessment tasks.

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

TL;DR: HALC is a pipeline for systematically constructing optimal prompts for LLM coding tasks, validated with 1,512 prompts and 2M requests, achieving reliable coding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the variability in prompting strategies' effectiveness across LLMs and tasks, and reduce reliance on trial and error.

Method: Proposes HALC, a pipeline for systematic prompt construction, tested with 1,512 prompts and 2M requests on Mistral NeMo, using expert codings as ground truth.

Result: Achieved reliable coding for single variables (αclimate = .76; αmovement = .78) and across two variables (αclimate = .71; αmovement = .74).

Conclusion: HALC provides insights into effective prompting strategies and reliable prompt identification for coding tasks, without optimizing codebooks for LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

*Yifan Wei,Xiaoyan Yu,Yixuan Weng,Tengfei Pan,Angsheng Li,Li Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoTIR is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances LLMs by enabling adaptive tool-use decisions, outperforming rigid methods in reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool-use methods in LLMs are rigid and risk degrading language competence, unlike human adaptive tool selection.

Method: AutoTIR uses reinforcement learning with a hybrid reward mechanism to optimize task correctness, structured output, and tool-use efficiency.

Result: AutoTIR outperforms baselines in diverse tasks, showing superior generalization in tool-use behavior.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning like AutoTIR holds promise for scalable and generalizable tool-integrated reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph-R1 improves GraphRAG by using lightweight hypergraph construction and RL for efficient, accurate retrieval and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in GraphRAG like high construction cost, fixed retrieval, and reliance on prompt design.

Method: Uses lightweight knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as multi-turn RL agent-environment interaction, and optimizes via end-to-end rewards.

Result: Outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG in accuracy, efficiency, and generation quality.

Conclusion: Graph-R1 offers a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing RAG with structured knowledge and RL.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in

### [214] [Rote Learning Considered Useful: Generalizing over Memorized Data in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21914)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generalize from rote memorized data using a two-phase framework, showing structured latent representations and potential for knowledge injection or misuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the belief that rote learning hinders generalization by showing LLMs can reinterpret memorized data.

Method: Two-phase framework: rote memorization of factual associations followed by fine-tuning on semantically meaningful prompts.

Result: Models generalize from memorized data, evidenced by structured latent representations.

Conclusion: Findings enable efficient knowledge injection but also highlight risks of misuse.

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

*Lujain Ibrahim,Franziska Sofia Hafner,Luc Rocher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Optimizing AI language models for warmth and empathy reduces their reliability, leading to higher error rates in safety-critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the trade-off between warmth and reliability in AI language models, especially when users express vulnerability.

Method: Controlled experiments on five language models, trained for warmth and evaluated on safety-critical tasks.

Result: Warm models showed higher error rates, promoted misinformation, and validated incorrect beliefs, especially with vulnerable users.

Conclusion: Current evaluation practices may overlook risks; a rethink is needed for developing and overseeing human-like AI systems.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

*Carel van Niekerk,Renato Vukovic,Benjamin Matthias Ruppik,Hsien-chin Lin,Milica Gašić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSF is a post-training method for LLMs that uses the model's own confidence as intrinsic feedback to improve calibration and reasoning without external labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated answers, limiting reliability on reasoning tasks. RLSF aims to mimic human self-feedback learning.

Method: RLSF ranks chain-of-thought solutions by confidence, uses synthetic preferences for fine-tuning via preference optimization, and requires no human labels.

Result: RLSF improves calibration and reasoning, enhancing performance on arithmetic and multiple-choice tasks.

Conclusion: RLSF demonstrates the potential of intrinsic rewards for efficient LLM post-training, warranting further research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

*Tianyi Hu,Andrea Morales-Garzón,Jingyi Zheng,Maria Maistro,Daniel Hershcovich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CARRIAGE, a RAG framework for cross-cultural recipe adaptation, addressing RAG's diversity limitation by enhancing retrieval and context organization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure cultural appropriateness and dietary diversity in recipe adaptation, while overcoming RAG's tendency to produce non-diverse outputs.

Method: Proposes CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework that improves diversity in retrieval and context organization.

Result: CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in diversity and quality compared to closed-book LLMs.

Conclusion: CARRIAGE is the first RAG framework explicitly designed for diverse outputs, successfully addressing RAG's limitations in creative tasks.

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs outperform traditional models in classifying microbial samples and predicting contamination risk using metadata alone, showing promise for environmental microbiology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models struggle with generalization in microbiome studies, especially with small samples or heterogeneous labels. LLMs offer a potential solution.

Method: Evaluated LLMs (ChatGPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, LLaMA 4) in zero-shot and few-shot settings against Random Forests on real-world datasets.

Result: LLMs outperformed baselines in ontology classification and contamination risk prediction, generalizing well across sites and metadata distributions.

Conclusion: LLMs effectively reason over sparse, heterogeneous metadata, offering a promising metadata-only approach for microbiology and biosurveillance.

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepSieve improves RAG by decomposing queries, routing sub-questions to optimal sources, and filtering noise, enhancing reasoning and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to static knowledge; RAG lacks fine-grained control, leading to noisy retrieval.

Method: DeepSieve uses LLM-as-a-knowledge-router to decompose queries, route sub-questions, and filter noise via multi-stage distillation.

Result: Outperforms conventional RAG in multi-hop QA, improving reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability.

Conclusion: DeepSieve offers a modular, transparent, and adaptable solution for knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TFC-SR, a novel continual learning method inspired by human learning strategies, outperforms baselines by using Active Recall Probe to stabilize past knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Neural Networks by mimicking human learning techniques like Active Recall and Spaced Repetition.

Method: Introduces Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall (TFC-SR), enhancing experience replay with Active Recall Probe for periodic task-aware evaluation.

Result: Achieves 13.17% accuracy on Split CIFAR-100 vs. 7.40% for standard replay, showing better performance in memory-constrained settings.

Conclusion: TFC-SR is robust and efficient, emphasizing the value of active memory retrieval in continual learning.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks often suffer from a critical limitation known as
Catastrophic Forgetting, where performance on past tasks degrades after
learning new ones. This paper introduces a novel continual learning approach
inspired by human learning strategies like Active Recall, Deliberate Practice
and Spaced Repetition, named Task Focused Consolidation with Spaced Recall
(TFC-SR). TFC-SR enhances the standard experience replay with a mechanism we
termed the Active Recall Probe. It is a periodic, task-aware evaluation of the
model's memory that stabilizes the representations of past knowledge. We test
TFC-SR on the Split MNIST and Split CIFAR-100 benchmarks against leading
regularization-based and replay-based baselines. Our results show that TFC-SR
performs significantly better than these methods. For instance, on the Split
CIFAR-100, it achieves a final accuracy of 13.17% compared to standard replay's
7.40%. We demonstrate that this advantage comes from the stabilizing effect of
the probe itself, and not from the difference in replay volume. Additionally,
we analyze the trade-off between memory size and performance and show that
while TFC-SR performs better in memory-constrained environments, higher replay
volume is still more effective when available memory is abundant. We conclude
that TFC-SR is a robust and efficient approach, highlighting the importance of
integrating active memory retrieval mechanisms into continual learning systems.

Motivation: To leverage quantum geometry for richer data representation and understanding cognitive phenomena.

Method: Represents data features as learned Hermitian matrices and maps data points to Hilbert space states, deriving geometric and topological properties.

Result: Demonstrates QCML's ability to capture global data properties and avoid dimensionality problems in synthetic and real-world examples.

Conclusion: QCML's quantum geometric representation could enhance understanding of cognitive phenomena in quantum cognition.

Abstract: We demonstrate how Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML) encodes data as
quantum geometry. In QCML, features of the data are represented by learned
Hermitian matrices, and data points are mapped to states in Hilbert space. The
quantum geometry description endows the dataset with rich geometric and
topological structure - including intrinsic dimension, quantum metric, and
Berry curvature - derived directly from the data. QCML captures global
properties of data, while avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in
local methods. We illustrate this on a number of synthetic and real-world
examples. Quantum geometric representation of QCML could advance our
understanding of cognitive phenomena within the framework of quantum cognition.

Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring proposed nonlinearities maximize variability and capture data diversity in unsupervised and supervised learning.

Method: Reviewed independence criteria, proposed 3 new ones, and designed dimensionality reduction methods evaluated in linear and neural nonlinear settings.

Result: Outperformed baselines (tSNE, PCA, LDA, VAE) in contrast, accuracy, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The methods open a new line of interpretable ML research, demonstrating superior performance over existing techniques.

Abstract: Unsupervised and supervised learning methods conventionally use kernels to
capture nonlinearities inherent in data structure. However experts have to
ensure their proposed nonlinearity maximizes variability and capture inherent
diversity of data. We reviewed all independence criteria to design unsupervised
learners. Then we proposed 3 independence criteria and used them to design
unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction methods. We evaluated
contrast, accuracy and interpretability of these methods in both linear and
neural nonlinear settings. The results show that the methods have outperformed
the baseline (tSNE, PCA, regularized LDA, VAE with (un)supervised learner and
layer sharing) and opened a new line of interpretable machine learning (ML) for

TL;DR: The paper proposes a contrastive learning framework to improve wildfire prediction by addressing data imbalance and high-dimensional spatio-temporal challenges, using smaller patch sizes without losing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfires severely impact ecosystems and health, worsened by climate change. Current methods face data imbalance and computational challenges, needing better solutions.

Method: Introduces morphology-based curriculum contrastive learning to enhance latent representations of dynamic features, reducing computational costs and handling regional diversity.

Result: Experimental analysis validates the framework's effectiveness in improving wildfire predictions.

Conclusion: The proposed contrastive learning approach successfully addresses key challenges in wildfire risk management.

Abstract: Wildfires significantly impact natural ecosystems and human health, leading
to biodiversity loss, increased hydrogeological risks, and elevated emissions
of toxic substances. Climate change exacerbates these effects, particularly in
regions with rising temperatures and prolonged dry periods, such as the
Mediterranean. This requires the development of advanced risk management
strategies that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. However, in this
context, the data show a bias toward an imbalanced setting, where the incidence
of wildfire events is significantly lower than typical situations. This
imbalance, coupled with the inherent complexity of high-dimensional
spatio-temporal data, poses significant challenges for training deep learning
architectures. Moreover, since precise wildfire predictions depend mainly on
weather data, finding a way to reduce computational costs to enable more
frequent updates using the latest weather forecasts would be beneficial. This
paper investigates how adopting a contrastive framework can address these
challenges through enhanced latent representations for the patch's dynamic
features. We thus introduce a new morphology-based curriculum contrastive
learning that mitigates issues associated with diverse regional characteristics
and enables the use of smaller patch sizes without compromising performance. An
experimental analysis is performed to validate the effectiveness of the
proposed modeling strategies.

demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior detection performance
with fewer iterations and lower computational complexity, making it a practical

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning models struggle with time series exhibiting strong heterogeneity in magnitude and sparsity, leading to systematic underperformance on low-magnitude and sparse series.

Method: SPADE-S mitigates biases through improved loss functions, training-time sampling, and time series encoding methods.

Result: SPADE-S achieves up to 15% better accuracy, with P90 gains of 2.21%-6.58% and P50 gains of 0.77%-1.95% across datasets.

Conclusion: SPADE-S effectively reduces biases and enhances forecasting accuracy, particularly for heterogeneous time series.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in time series forecasting, accurate
modeling of time series with strong heterogeneity in magnitude and/or sparsity
patterns remains challenging for state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
We identify several factors that lead existing models to systematically
underperform on low-magnitude and sparse time series, including loss functions
with implicit biases toward high-magnitude series, training-time sampling
methods, and limitations of time series encoding methods.
  SPADE-S is a robust forecasting architecture that significantly reduces
magnitude- and sparsity-based systematic biases and improves overall prediction
accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that SPADE-S outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches across a diverse set of use cases in demand
forecasting. In particular, we show that, depending on the quantile forecast
and magnitude of the series, SPADE-S can improve forecast accuracy by up to
15%. This results in P90 overall forecast accuracy gains of 2.21%, 6.58%, and
4.28%, and P50 forecast accuracy gains of 0.92%, 0.77%, and 1.95%,
respectively, for each of three distinct datasets, ranging from 3 million to

Motivation: To tackle the challenge of data distribution changes between training and deployment, which conventional methods fail to handle adequately.

Method: Formalizes distribution shifts, reviews detection and mitigation techniques, and evaluates current mechanisms.

Result: Identifies gaps in handling distribution shifts and proposes future research directions.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive review of distribution shift literature, emphasizing overlooked OOD data.

Abstract: In the field of Machine Learning (ML) and data-driven applications, one of
the significant challenge is the change in data distribution between the
training and deployment stages, commonly known as distribution shift. This
paper outlines different mechanisms for handling two main types of distribution
shifts: (i) Covariate shift: where the value of features or covariates change
between train and test data, and (ii) Concept/Semantic-shift: where model
experiences shift in the concept learned during training due to emergence of
novel classes in the test phase. We sum up our contributions in three folds.
First, we formalize distribution shifts, recite on how the conventional method
fails to handle them adequately and urge for a model that can simultaneously
perform better in all types of distribution shifts. Second, we discuss why
handling distribution shifts is important and provide an extensive review of
the methods and techniques that have been developed to detect, measure, and
mitigate the effects of these shifts. Third, we discuss the current state of
distribution shift handling mechanisms and propose future research directions
in this area. Overall, we provide a retrospective synopsis of the literature in
the distribution shift, focusing on OOD data that had been overlooked in the
existing surveys.

TL;DR: A novel method couples representation learning with an analytically solvable one-class SVM for unsupervised anomaly detection, showing robustness in domain shifts and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing UAD methods, such as poor anomaly reconstruction or suboptimal feature spaces, by tightly integrating feature learning with anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes a custom loss formulation aligning latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary, evaluated on MNIST-C and brain MRI tasks.

Result: Demonstrates performance and robustness, especially in detecting subtle lesions and handling domain shifts.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for general UAD and medical imaging, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to detect anomalies without labeled
data, a necessity in many machine learning applications where anomalous samples
are rare or not available. Most state-of-the-art methods fall into two
categories: reconstruction-based approaches, which often reconstruct anomalies
too well, and decoupled representation learning with density estimators, which
can suffer from suboptimal feature spaces. While some recent methods attempt to
couple feature learning and anomaly detection, they often rely on surrogate
objectives, restrict kernel choices, or introduce approximations that limit
their expressiveness and robustness. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method that tightly couples representation learning with an analytically
solvable one-class SVM (OCSVM), through a custom loss formulation that directly
aligns latent features with the OCSVM decision boundary. The model is evaluated
on two tasks: a new benchmark based on MNIST-C, and a challenging brain MRI
subtle lesion detection task. Unlike most methods that focus on large,
hyperintense lesions at the image level, our approach succeeds to target small,
non-hyperintense lesions, while we evaluate voxel-wise metrics, addressing a
more clinically relevant scenario. Both experiments evaluate a form of
robustness to domain shifts, including corruption types in MNIST-C and
scanner/age variations in MRI. Results demonstrate performance and robustness
of our proposed mode,highlighting its potential for general UAD and real-world
medical imaging applications. The source code is available at

Motivation: Current training datasets are static, limiting progress in complex reasoning. The paper aims to explore interaction as a scalable driver of intelligence.

Method: AGORA, a self-evolving framework, enables collaborative ensembles to outperform monolithic systems by leveraging group emergent abilities.

Result: AGORA achieves up to 4.45 percentage points higher performance on mathematical benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art monolithic systems.

Conclusion: Engineering collaborative ecosystems is a promising frontier for capability emergence, validating interaction as a key driver of intelligence.

Abstract: Progress in complex reasoning is constrained by the static nature of the
current training datasets. We propose structured interaction as a new scaling
axis, moving beyond the prevailing paradigm of increasing model parameters. Our
self-evolving framework, AGORA, enables a collaborative ensemble to achieve
reasoning performance exceeding state-of-the-art monolithic systems by up to
4.45 percentage points on challenging mathematical benchmarks. This gain stems
from group emergent ability-the synthesis of collective capabilities
unattainable by isolated models, validating interaction as a scalable driver of
intelligence. Our results position the engineering of collaborative ecosystems

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAI-ML framework improves interpretability of XGBoost for sarcopenia risk assessment by distilling feature attributions into probabilistic formats and generating diagnostic narratives via an LLM, achieving higher accuracy and reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in high-performance machine learning models like XGBoost to enhance clinical adoption.

Method: Proposes LAI-ML, a knowledge distillation architecture using HAGA and CACS techniques to transform XGBoost feature attributions into probabilistic formats, then employs an LLM with reinforcement learning for narrative generation.

Result: Achieved 83% prediction accuracy (13% higher than baseline XGBoost) and corrected predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases.

Conclusion: LAI-ML successfully bridges the gap between accuracy and interpretability, providing a deployable solution for medical AI.

Abstract: Background & Aims: High-performance machine learning models like XGBoost are
often "black boxes," limiting their clinical adoption due to a lack of
interpretability. This study aims to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy
and narrative transparency for sarcopenia risk assessment. Methods: We propose
the LLM-Adapted Interpretation Framework (LAI-ML), a novel knowledge
distillation architecture. LAI-ML transforms feature attributions from a
trained XGBoost model into a probabilistic format using specialized techniques
(HAGA and CACS). A Large Language Model (LLM), guided by a reinforcement
learning loop and case-based retrieval, then generates data-faithful diagnostic
narratives. Results: The LAI-ML framework achieved 83% prediction accuracy,
significantly outperforming the baseline XGBoost model, 13% higher. Notably,
the LLM not only replicated the teacher model's logic but also corrected its
predictions in 21.7% of discordant cases, demonstrating enhanced reasoning.
Conclusion: LAI-ML effectively translates opaque model predictions into
trustworthy and interpretable clinical insights, offering a deployable solution
to the "black-box" problem in medical AI.

*Guangchen Lan,Sipeng Zhang,Tianle Wang,Yuwei Zhang,Daoan Zhang,Xinpeng Wei,Xiaoman Pan,Hongming Zhang,Dong-Jun Han,Christopher G. Brinton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MaPPO is a new framework for aligning LLMs with human preferences by incorporating prior reward knowledge, improving upon existing methods like DPO without extra hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like DPO treat preference learning as MLE, oversimplifying response classification. MaPPO aims to enhance alignment by integrating prior knowledge.

Method: MaPPO extends MLE to a Maximum a Posteriori objective, incorporating prior reward estimates, and works in offline/online settings.

Result: Empirical evaluations show MaPPO improves alignment performance on benchmarks like MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0 without computational trade-offs.

Conclusion: MaPPO generalizes and improves existing methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for preference optimization in LLMs.

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

*Haowei Lin,Xiangyu Wang,Jianzhu Ma,Yitao Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoSLD automates scaling law discovery using evolutionary algorithms and LLMs, outperforming manual methods and baselines in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual discovery of scaling laws is labor-intensive; EvoSLD aims to automate this process for AI research acceleration.

Method: EvoSLD uses evolutionary algorithms guided by LLMs to co-evolve symbolic expressions and optimization routines, handling diverse experimental variables.

Result: EvoSLD rediscovers human-derived laws in some cases and surpasses them in others, reducing errors significantly on test sets.

Conclusion: EvoSLD is a promising tool for automating scaling law discovery, offering superior accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

*Raj Krishnan Vijayaraj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LAPD, a geometry-aware framework to evaluate clinical LLMs' robustness under adversarial edits, revealing latent fragility despite high static benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical LLMs often fail under small input shifts (e.g., masking symptoms), unnoticed by standard NLP metrics, posing risks in safety-critical applications.

Method: Proposes LAPD with Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR) to measure representational instability in PCA-reduced latent space under structured adversarial edits (masking, negation, etc.).

Result: Latent fragility emerges even with minimal surface changes, validated on real clinical notes, showing a gap between surface and semantic robustness.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for geometry-aware auditing in clinical AI to ensure semantic stability beyond surface metrics.

Abstract: LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically
meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding,
despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures
frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to
latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a
geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation
Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical
LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce
Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that
captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries
in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured
prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four
axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate
common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and
clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal
surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical
notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of
LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between
surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of
geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an alternative to finite-dimensional machine learning models by leveraging infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces for improved learning tasks.

Method: Uses Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), spectral operator learning, and wavelet-domain representations, along with scattering transforms and Koopman operators.

Result: Presents a mathematical framework for Hilbert space learning and discusses its advantages and limitations compared to traditional neural networks.

Conclusion: Proposes scalable and interpretable machine learning directions based on Hilbertian signal processing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A non-neural learning framework using Graph Laplacian Wavelet Transforms (GLWT) for graph-based tasks, offering transparency and efficiency over neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an interpretable and resource-efficient alternative to neural networks for graph learning tasks.

Method: Uses GLWT for signal decomposition, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients, with a domain-specific language (DSL) for reasoning.

Result: Competitive performance in synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token graphs compared to lightweight GNNs.

Conclusion: Proposes a transparent, efficient, and principled alternative to deep neural architectures for graph learning.

Abstract: We present a fully non neural learning framework based on Graph Laplacian
Wavelet Transforms (GLWT). Unlike traditional architectures that rely on
convolutional, recurrent, or attention based neural networks, our model
operates purely in the graph spectral domain using structured multiscale
filtering, nonlinear shrinkage, and symbolic logic over wavelet coefficients.
Signals defined on graph nodes are decomposed via GLWT, modulated with
interpretable nonlinearities, and recombined for downstream tasks such as
denoising and token classification. The system supports compositional reasoning
through a symbolic domain-specific language (DSL) over graph wavelet
activations. Experiments on synthetic graph denoising and linguistic token
graphs demonstrate competitive performance against lightweight GNNs with far
greater transparency and efficiency. This work proposes a principled,
interpretable, and resource-efficient alternative to deep neural architectures

### [237] [Exploring Adaptive Structure Learning for Heterophilic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21191)
*Garv Kaushik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes structure learning to rewire edges in shallow GCNs to capture long-range dependencies in heterophilic graphs, though it lacks generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving GCN performance on heterophilic graphs by addressing limitations in capturing long-range dependencies due to localized feature aggregation.

Method: Parameterizing the adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extending the hop span of shallow GCNs.

Result: The method captures long-range dependencies but performs inconsistently on node classification tasks and lacks generalizability.

Conclusion: While the approach addresses oversmoothing and improves dependency capture, its effectiveness varies with graph structure and is not universally applicable.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) gained traction for graph representation
learning, with recent attention on improving performance on heterophilic graphs
for various real-world applications. The localized feature aggregation in a
typical message-passing paradigm hinders the capturing of long-range
dependencies between non-local nodes of the same class. The inherent
connectivity structure in heterophilic graphs often conflicts with information
sharing between distant nodes of same class. We propose structure learning to
rewire edges in shallow GCNs itself to avoid performance degradation in
downstream discriminative tasks due to oversmoothing. Parameterizing the
adjacency matrix to learn connections between non-local nodes and extend the
hop span of shallow GCNs facilitates the capturing of long-range dependencies.
However, our method is not generalizable across heterophilic graphs and
performs inconsistently on node classification task contingent to the graph
structure.

Motivation: To improve edge intelligence in contested environments by integrating digital twins and generative AI for realistic training.

Method: Multi-layer architecture with on-device edge intelligence, digital twin synchronization, and generative scenario training using diffusion models and transformers.

Result: Faster learning convergence, higher throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against jamming and failures.

Conclusion: EdgeAgentX-DT demonstrates the potential of digital-twin-enabled generative training for robust edge AI in military networks.

Abstract: We introduce EdgeAgentX-DT, an advanced extension of the EdgeAgentX framework
that integrates digital twin simulations and generative AI-driven scenario
training to significantly enhance edge intelligence in military networks.
EdgeAgentX-DT utilizes network digital twins, virtual replicas synchronized
with real-world edge devices, to provide a secure, realistic environment for
training and validation. Leveraging generative AI methods, such as diffusion
models and transformers, the system creates diverse and adversarial scenarios
for robust simulation-based agent training. Our multi-layer architecture
includes: (1) on-device edge intelligence; (2) digital twin synchronization;
and (3) generative scenario training. Experimental simulations demonstrate
notable improvements over EdgeAgentX, including faster learning convergence,
higher network throughput, reduced latency, and improved resilience against
jamming and node failures. A case study involving a complex tactical scenario
with simultaneous jamming attacks, agent failures, and increased network loads
illustrates how EdgeAgentX-DT sustains operational performance, whereas
baseline methods fail. These results highlight the potential of
digital-twin-enabled generative training to strengthen edge AI deployments in
contested environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit the effectiveness of traditional ML interpretation in guiding subgroup-specific modeling.

Method: The framework integrates SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised clustering to identify clinically meaningful subgroup-specific characteristics.

Result: Evaluated on three EHR datasets, AdaptHetero identifies heterogeneous model behaviors and improves predictive performance for ICU mortality, in-hospital death, and hidden hypoxemia.

Conclusion: AdaptHetero effectively transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance for subgroup-specific modeling in EHRs.

Abstract: Machine learning interpretation has primarily been leveraged to build
clinician trust and uncover actionable insights in EHRs. However, the intrinsic
complexity and heterogeneity of EHR data limit its effectiveness in guiding
subgroup-specific modeling. We propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven
framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance
for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations within
individual hospital systems. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -
GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV - AdaptHetero consistently identifies
heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death,
and hidden hypoxemia. By integrating SHAP-based interpretation and unsupervised
clustering, the framework enhances the identification of clinically meaningful
subgroup-specific characteristics, leading to improved predictive performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grab, a gradient inversion attack for language models in federated learning, recovers up to 92.9% of private training data by combining hybrid optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The privacy threat of gradient inversion attacks in federated learning is underestimated for language models due to discrete token challenges.

Method: Grab uses hybrid optimization: alternating dropout mask optimization and discrete token sequencing.

Result: Achieves up to 92.9% recovery rate, outperforming prior methods by 28.9%-48.5%.

Conclusion: Grab advances understanding of privacy risks in federated learning for language models.

Abstract: The gradient inversion attack has been demonstrated as a significant privacy
threat to federated learning (FL), particularly in continuous domains such as
vision models. In contrast, it is often considered less effective or highly
dependent on impractical training settings when applied to language models, due
to the challenges posed by the discrete nature of tokens in text data. As a
result, its potential privacy threats remain largely underestimated, despite FL
being an emerging training method for language models. In this work, we propose
a domain-specific gradient inversion attack named Grab (gradient inversion with
hybrid optimization). Grab features two alternating optimization processes to
address the challenges caused by practical training settings, including a
simultaneous optimization on dropout masks between layers for improved token
recovery and a discrete optimization for effective token sequencing. Grab can
recover a significant portion (up to 92.9% recovery rate) of the private
training data, outperforming the attack strategy of utilizing discrete
optimization with an auxiliary model by notable improvements of up to 28.9%
recovery rate in benchmark settings and 48.5% recovery rate in practical
settings. Grab provides a valuable step forward in understanding this privacy
threat in the emerging FL training mode of language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a single compositional LLM for diverse IMAs, proposing ContextLoRA for task adaptation and ContextGear for efficiency, validated on benchmarks and a real-world testbed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IMAs rely on multiple LLMs, which is inefficient. The paper aims to unify diverse IMA tasks under a single LLM while addressing adaptation and resource constraints.

Method: Proposes ContextLoRA for structured context learning via task dependency graphs and parameter partitioning, and ContextGear for optimized training scheduling.

Result: Superior performance on benchmarks and practical validation on a wireless testbed, demonstrating adaptability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The paradigm successfully unifies IMAs with a single LLM, offering a scalable and efficient solution for wireless networks.

Abstract: Interactive multimodal applications (IMAs), such as route planning in the
Internet of Vehicles, enrich users' personalized experiences by integrating
various forms of data over wireless networks. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) utilize mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanisms to empower multiple
IMAs, with each LLM trained individually for a specific task that presents
different business workflows. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on
multiple LLMs for IMAs, this paper presents a novel paradigm that accomplishes
various IMAs using a single compositional LLM over wireless networks. The two
primary challenges include 1) guiding a single LLM to adapt to diverse IMA
objectives and 2) ensuring the flexibility and efficiency of the LLM in
resource-constrained mobile environments. To tackle the first challenge, we
propose ContextLoRA, a novel method that guides an LLM to learn the rich
structured context among IMAs by constructing a task dependency graph. We
partition the learnable parameter matrix of neural layers for each IMA to
facilitate LLM composition. Then, we develop a step-by-step fine-tuning
procedure guided by task relations, including training, freezing, and masking
phases. This allows the LLM to learn to reason among tasks for better
adaptation, capturing the latent dependencies between tasks. For the second
challenge, we introduce ContextGear, a scheduling strategy to optimize the
training procedure of ContextLoRA, aiming to minimize computational and
communication costs through a strategic grouping mechanism. Experiments on
three benchmarks show the superiority of the proposed ContextLoRA and
ContextGear. Furthermore, we prototype our proposed paradigm on a real-world
wireless testbed, demonstrating its practical applicability for various IMAs.
We will release our code to the community.

*Harsh Rangwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in deep learning with real-world data, proposing robust algorithms for learning from imperfect, long-tailed datasets without intensive curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is often imbalanced and imperfect, unlike curated datasets, limiting deep model performance. The goal is to develop algorithms that learn effectively from such data.

Method: The thesis presents four approaches: 1) Learning generative models for tail classes, 2) Inductive regularization for tail class generalization, 3) Optimizing metrics for semi-supervised learning, and 4) Efficient domain adaptation with minimal labeled data.

Result: The proposed methods mitigate mode-collapse, improve tail class generalization, optimize learning metrics, and enable domain adaptation with few labels.

Conclusion: The work advances deep learning for real-world data by addressing imbalance and distribution shifts, reducing reliance on curated datasets.

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

TL;DR: Bubbleformer, a transformer-based model, autonomously forecasts boiling dynamics (nucleation, interface evolution, heat transfer) without relying on future inputs during inference, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural PDE surrogates fail to learn nucleation from past states and struggle with flow boiling velocity fields, limiting autonomous forecasting of boiling dynamics.

Method: Bubbleformer uses factorized axial attention, frequency-aware scaling, and thermophysical parameter conditioning to generalize across fluids, geometries, and conditions. It avoids simulation data dependency during inference.

Result: Bubbleformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting and forecasting two-phase boiling flows, validated by physics-based metrics and the BubbleML 2.0 dataset.

Conclusion: Bubbleformer advances boiling dynamics modeling by addressing nucleation and interface-momentum coupling challenges, enabling autonomous forecasting and generalization.

Abstract: Modeling boiling (an inherently chaotic, multiphase process central to energy
and thermal systems) remains a significant challenge for neural PDE surrogates.
Existing models require future input (e.g., bubble positions) during inference
because they fail to learn nucleation from past states, limiting their ability
to autonomously forecast boiling dynamics. They also fail to model flow boiling
velocity fields, where sharp interface-momentum coupling demands long-range and
directional inductive biases. We introduce Bubbleformer, a transformer-based
spatiotemporal model that forecasts stable and long-range boiling dynamics
including nucleation, interface evolution, and heat transfer without dependence
on simulation data during inference. Bubbleformer integrates factorized axial
attention, frequency-aware scaling, and conditions on thermophysical parameters
to generalize across fluids, geometries, and operating conditions. To evaluate
physical fidelity in chaotic systems, we propose interpretable physics-based
metrics that evaluate heat-flux consistency, interface geometry, and mass
conservation. We also release BubbleML 2.0, a high-fidelity dataset that spans
diverse working fluids (cryogens, refrigerants, dielectrics), boiling
configurations (pool and flow boiling), flow regimes (bubbly, slug, annular),
and boundary conditions. Bubbleformer sets new benchmark results in both
prediction and forecasting of two-phase boiling flows.

TL;DR: Adam-PnP is a Plug-and-Play framework that enhances protein diffusion models by integrating gradients from multiple noisy experimental sources, reducing manual tuning needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide deep generative models for protein structure recovery.

Method: Adam-PnP uses an adaptive noise estimation scheme and dynamic modality weighting within the diffusion process.

Result: Experiments show Adam-PnP significantly improves reconstruction accuracy.

Conclusion: Adam-PnP offers a robust solution for integrating heterogeneous data into diffusion models for protein structure recovery.

Abstract: In an inverse problem, the goal is to recover an unknown parameter (e.g., an
image) that has typically undergone some lossy or noisy transformation during
measurement. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models,
have emerged as powerful priors for protein structure generation. However,
integrating noisy experimental data from multiple sources to guide these models
remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often require precise
knowledge of experimental noise levels and manually tuned weights for each data
modality. In this work, we introduce Adam-PnP, a Plug-and-Play framework that
guides a pre-trained protein diffusion model using gradients from multiple,
heterogeneous experimental sources. Our framework features an adaptive noise
estimation scheme and a dynamic modality weighting mechanism integrated into
the diffusion process, which reduce the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.
Experiments on complex reconstruction tasks demonstrate significantly improved
accuracy using Adam-PnP.

TL;DR: DeepPCE combines PCE with probabilistic circuits to scale PCE for high-dimensional problems, matching MLP performance while retaining exact statistical inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCE's exponential growth of basis functions with parameters limits its scalability in high-dimensional problems.

Method: DeepPCE integrates PCE with probabilistic circuits, enabling deep generalization for high-dimensional inputs.

Result: DeepPCE achieves MLP-like predictive performance and retains PCE's exact statistical inference capabilities.

Conclusion: DeepPCE effectively scales PCE to high dimensions, maintaining performance and inference advantages.

Abstract: Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a classical and widely used surrogate
modeling technique in physical simulation and uncertainty quantification. By
taking a linear combination of a set of basis polynomials - orthonormal with
respect to the distribution of uncertain input parameters - PCE enables
tractable inference of key statistical quantities, such as (conditional) means,
variances, covariances, and Sobol sensitivity indices, which are essential for
understanding the modeled system and identifying influential parameters and
their interactions. As the number of basis functions grows exponentially with
the number of parameters, PCE does not scale well to high-dimensional problems.
We address this challenge by combining PCE with ideas from probabilistic
circuits, resulting in the deep polynomial chaos expansion (DeepPCE) - a deep
generalization of PCE that scales effectively to high-dimensional input spaces.
DeepPCE achieves predictive performance comparable to that of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs), while retaining PCE's ability to compute exact statistical
inferences via simple forward passes.

TL;DR: LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic) uses LLMs to suggest novel items in recommendation systems, refining them with a lightweight policy via bilevel optimization, improving diversity, novelty, and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diversity and novelty in recommendations are often overlooked for click relevance. RL methods rely on random exploration, which may not align with user interests.

Method: LAAC leverages LLMs as reference policies for novelty, trains a lightweight policy with bilevel optimization, and regularizes critic values to avoid overestimating unreliable LLM suggestions.

Result: LAAC outperforms baselines in diversity, novelty, and accuracy, and remains robust on imbalanced data without expensive LLM fine-tuning.

Conclusion: LAAC effectively integrates LLM knowledge into recommendation systems, balancing novelty and relevance without costly fine-tuning.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, diversity and novelty are essential for capturing
varied user preferences and encouraging exploration, yet many systems
prioritize click relevance. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored
to improve diversity, it often depends on random exploration that may not align
with user interests. We propose LAAC (LLM-guided Adversarial Actor Critic), a
novel method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as reference policies
to suggest novel items, while training a lightweight policy to refine these
suggestions using system-specific data. The method formulates training as a
bilevel optimization between actor and critic networks, enabling the critic to
selectively favor promising novel actions and the actor to improve its policy
beyond LLM recommendations. To mitigate overestimation of unreliable LLM
suggestions, we apply regularization that anchors critic values for unexplored
items close to well-estimated dataset actions. Experiments on real-world
datasets show that LAAC outperforms existing baselines in diversity, novelty,
and accuracy, while remaining robust on imbalanced data, effectively
integrating LLM knowledge without expensive fine-tuning.

Motivation: Leveraging known physics (full-order models) alongside data can enhance predictive accuracy in reduced-order modeling of chaotic systems.

Result: The hybrid approach significantly improves time-series predictions for various data scenarios, including abundant, scarce, or incorrect full-order models.

Conclusion: Integrating physics and data in reduced-order modeling enhances predictive capability, even with imperfect physics or limited data.

Abstract: While data-driven techniques are powerful tools for reduced-order modeling of
systems with chaotic dynamics, great potential remains for leveraging known
physics (i.e. a full-order model (FOM)) to improve predictive capability. We
develop a hybrid reduced order model (ROM), informed by both data and FOM, for
evolving spatiotemporal chaotic dynamics on an invariant manifold whose
coordinates are found using an autoencoder. This approach projects the vector
field of the FOM onto the invariant manifold; then, this physics-derived vector
field is either corrected using dynamic data, or used as a Bayesian prior that
is updated with data. In both cases, the neural ordinary differential equation
approach is used. We consider simulated data from the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and
complex Ginzburg-Landau equations. Relative to the data-only approach, for
scenarios of abundant data, scarce data, and even an incorrect FOM (i.e.
erroneous parameter values), the hybrid approach yields substantially improved
time-series predictions.

*Wenkai Tan,Alvaro Velasquez,Houbing Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neuro-symbolic framework combines neural networks and symbolic physics to reconstruct and simulate elastic objects from sparse images without explicit geometry, using NeRF for reconstruction and PINN for physics constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap between purely empirical methods (risking physical inaccuracies) and traditional solvers (requiring full geometry and being costly).

Method: Integrates neural radiance fields (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed neural networks (PINN) incorporating elasticity PDEs, handling boundary conditions via an energy-constrained PINN.

Result: Learns spatiotemporal representations of deforming objects, improving simulation accuracy and explainability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges data-driven learning and symbolic physics, enabling accurate and interpretable simulations from sparse data.

Abstract: Neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling physical
systems, offering the ability to learn complex representations from limited
data while integrating foundational scientific knowledge. In particular,
neuro-symbolic approaches that combine data-driven learning, the neuro, with
symbolic equations and rules, the symbolic, address the tension between methods
that are purely empirical, which risk straying from established physical
principles, and traditional numerical solvers that demand complete geometric
knowledge and can be prohibitively expensive for high-fidelity simulations. In
this work, we present a novel neuro-symbolic framework for reconstructing and
simulating elastic objects directly from sparse multi-view image sequences,
without requiring explicit geometric information. Specifically, we integrate a
neural radiance field (NeRF) for object reconstruction with physics-informed
neural networks (PINN) that incorporate the governing partial differential
equations of elasticity. In doing so, our method learns a spatiotemporal
representation of deforming objects that leverages both image supervision and
symbolic physical constraints. To handle complex boundary and initial
conditions, which are traditionally confronted using finite element methods,
boundary element methods, or sensor-based measurements, we employ an
energy-constrained Physics-Informed Neural Network architecture. This design
enhances both simulation accuracy and the explainability of results.

TL;DR: CDNet, a Contrastive Diffusion-based Network, improves deep learning classifiers for time series classification by generating informative samples and handling noise, class similarity, and multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for time series classification struggle with noisy, similar, and multimodal data, limiting their performance.

Method: CDNet uses a learned diffusion process to generate positive and negative samples, with convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps and an uncertainty-weighted composite loss.

Result: CDNet outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets, especially in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: CDNet effectively enhances classifier performance under difficult data conditions, offering a robust solution for time series classification.

Abstract: Deep learning models are widely used for time series classification (TSC) due
to their scalability and efficiency. However, their performance degrades under
challenging data conditions such as class similarity, multimodal distributions,
and noise. To address these limitations, we propose CDNet, a Contrastive
Diffusion-based Network that enhances existing classifiers by generating
informative positive and negative samples via a learned diffusion process.
Unlike traditional diffusion models that denoise individual samples, CDNet
learns transitions between samples--both within and across classes--through
convolutional approximations of reverse diffusion steps. We introduce a
theoretically grounded CNN-based mechanism to enable both denoising and mode
coverage, and incorporate an uncertainty-weighted composite loss for robust
training. Extensive experiments on the UCR Archive and simulated datasets
demonstrate that CDNet significantly improves state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep
learning classifiers, particularly under noisy, similar, and multimodal
conditions.

*Xuan Wu,Di Wang,Chunguo Wu,Kaifang Qi,Chunyan Miao,Yubin Xiao,Jian Zhang,You Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ECHO, a Neural Combinatorial Optimization solver, addresses the min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP) by capturing local topological relationships, reducing myopic decisions, and leveraging vehicle permutation invariance and node symmetry. It outperforms existing solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing solvers for MMHCVRP often make myopic decisions and overlook key problem properties, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: ECHO uses a dual-modality node encoder, a Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism, and a tailored data augmentation strategy for MMHCVRP.

Result: ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in experiments, showing strong generalization across scales and distribution patterns.

Conclusion: ECHO effectively addresses MMHCVRP limitations, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Numerous Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) solvers have been proposed
to address Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most of these solvers
focus exclusively on single-vehicle VRP variants, overlooking the more
realistic min-max Heterogeneous Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (MMHCVRP),
which involves multiple vehicles. Existing MMHCVRP solvers typically select a
vehicle and its next node to visit at each decoding step, but often make myopic
decoding decisions and overlook key properties of MMHCVRP, including local
topological relationships, vehicle permutation invariance, and node symmetry,
resulting in suboptimal performance. To better address these limitations, we
propose ECHO, an efficient NCO solver. First, ECHO exploits the proposed
dual-modality node encoder to capture local topological relationships among
nodes. Subsequently, to mitigate myopic decisions, ECHO employs the proposed
Parameter-Free Cross-Attention mechanism to prioritize the vehicle selected in
the preceding decoding step. Finally, leveraging vehicle permutation invariance
and node symmetry, we introduce a tailored data augment strategy for MMHCVRP to
stabilize the Reinforcement Learning training process. To assess the
performance of ECHO, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results
demonstrate that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art NCO solvers across varying
numbers of vehicles and nodes, and exhibits well-performing generalization
across both scales and distribution patterns. Finally, ablation studies
validate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces EpochCore, a hardware accelerator for State-Space Models (SSMs), achieving significant performance and energy efficiency improvements over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models (RNNs, CNNs, Transformers) struggle with long sequences due to memory limitations. SSMs offer better efficiency but require intensive computation, motivating specialized hardware.

Method: EpochCore uses systolic arrays and a versatile processing element (LIMA-PE) with a novel dataflow (ProDF) to optimize SSM execution.

Result: EpochCore achieves 250x performance gains, 45x energy efficiency, and ~2,000x latency improvement over GPUs on LRA datasets.

Conclusion: EpochCore is a highly efficient hardware solution for SSMs, addressing the limitations of traditional models and accelerators.

Abstract: Sequence modeling is crucial for AI to understand temporal data and detect
complex time-dependent patterns. While recurrent neural networks (RNNs),
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and Transformers have advanced in
capturing long-range dependencies, they struggle with achieving high accuracy
with very long sequences due to limited memory retention (fixed context
window). State-Space Models (SSMs) leverage exponentially decaying memory
enabling lengthy context window and so they process very long data sequences
more efficiently than recurrent and Transformer-based models. Unlike
traditional neural models like CNNs and RNNs, SSM-based models require solving
differential equations through continuous integration, making training and
inference both compute- and memory-intensive on conventional CPUs and GPUs. In
this paper we introduce a specialized hardware accelerator, EpochCore, for
accelerating SSMs. EpochCore is based on systolic arrays (SAs) and is designed
to enhance the energy efficiency and throughput of inference of SSM-based
models for long-range sequence tasks. Within the SA, we propose a versatile
processing element (PE) called LIMA-PE to perform traditional and specialized
MAC operations to support traditional DNNs and SSMs. To complement the
EpochCore microarchitecture, we propose a novel dataflow, ProDF, which enables
highly efficient execution of SSM-based models. By leveraging the LIMA-PE
microarchitecture and ProDF, EpochCore achieves on average 250x gains in
performance and 45x improvement in energy efficiency, at the expense of 2x
increase in area cost over traditional SA-based accelerators, and around
~2,000x improvement in latency/inference on LRA datasets compared to GPU kernel
operations.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In many multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) applications, being
able to systematically explore the Pareto-stationary solutions under multiple
non-convex reward objectives with theoretical finite-time sample complexity
guarantee is an important and yet under-explored problem. This motivates us to
take the first step and fill the important gap in MORL. Specifically, in this
paper, we propose a \uline{M}ulti-\uline{O}bjective weighted-\uline{CH}ebyshev
\uline{A}ctor-critic (MOCHA) algorithm for MORL, which judiciously integrates
the weighted-Chebychev (WC) and actor-critic framework to enable
Pareto-stationarity exploration systematically with finite-time sample
complexity guarantee. Sample complexity result of MOCHA algorithm reveals an
interesting dependency on $p_{\min}$ in finding an $\epsilon$-Pareto-stationary
solution, where $p_{\min}$ denotes the minimum entry of a given weight vector
$\mathbf{p}$ in WC-scarlarization. By carefully choosing learning rates, the
sample complexity for each exploration can be
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Furthermore, simulation studies on a
large KuaiRand offline dataset, show that the performance of MOCHA algorithm
significantly outperforms other baseline MORL approaches.

*Amber Huang,Ian Scott Knight,Slava Naprienko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The LIT-PCBA benchmark is flawed due to data leakage, duplication, and analog redundancy, invalidating its use for fair model evaluation. A trivial memorization-based baseline outperforms state-of-the-art models, highlighting the dataset's unreliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose critical flaws in the LIT-PCBA benchmark, which compromise its validity for evaluating virtual screening models.

Method: Audited the dataset for data leakage, duplication, and structural redundancy, then demonstrated the impact by creating a trivial memorization-based baseline.

Result: Identified 2,491 duplicated inactives, leaked query ligands, and high structural redundancy, leading to invalid model evaluations. The baseline outperformed advanced models.

Conclusion: LIT-PCBA is unfit for its purpose, and previous results using it are questionable. The audit aims to improve future dataset rigor.

Abstract: LIT-PCBA is a widely used benchmark for virtual screening, but our audit
reveals it is fundamentally compromised. The dataset suffers from egregious
data leakage, rampant duplication, and pervasive analog redundancy -- flaws
that invalidate its use for fair model evaluation. Notably, we identify 2,491
inactives duplicated across training and validation sets, and thousands more
repeated within individual data splits (2,945 in training, 789 in validation).
Critically, three ligands in the query set -- meant to represent unseen test
cases -- are leaked: two appear in the training set, one in validation.
Structural redundancy compounds these issues: for some targets, over 80% of
query ligands are near duplicates, with Tanimoto similarity >= 0.9. In ALDH1
alone, we find 323 highly similar active pairs between training and validation
sets, invalidating claims of chemical diversity. These and other flaws
collectively cause models trained on LIT-PCBA to memorize rather than
generalize. To demonstrate the consequences of these data integrity failures,
we implement a trivial memorization-based baseline -- using no learning, no
physics, and no modeling -- that outperforms state-of-the-art models, including
deep neural networks like CHEESE, on LIT-PCBA simply by exploiting these
artifacts. Our findings render the benchmark unfit for its intended purpose and
call into question previous results based on its use. We share this audit to
raise awareness and provide tooling to help the community develop more rigorous
and reliable datasets going forward. All scripts necessary to reproduce our
audit and the baseline implementation are available at:

*Sujia Huang,Lele Fu,Zhen Cui,Tong Zhang,Na Song,Bo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy for GNNs to improve representation learning in heterophilous and noisy graphs by dynamically modulating message passing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Native graph interactions may hinder effective message passing, prompting the need for rewiring methods to enhance learning and robustness.

Method: Introduces an interference-aware torque metric to quantify edge perturbation, guiding hierarchical rewiring by pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilous, homophilous, and noisy graphs.

Conclusion: The torque-driven rewiring strategy effectively improves GNN performance by optimizing message passing and reducing noise.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data, leveraging message passing to diffuse information and
update node representations. However, most efforts have suggested that native
interactions encoded in the graph may not be friendly for this process,
motivating the development of graph rewiring methods. In this work, we propose
a torque-driven hierarchical rewiring strategy, inspired by the notion of
torque in classical mechanics, dynamically modulating message passing to
improve representation learning in heterophilous graphs and enhance robustness
against noisy graphs. Specifically, we define an interference-aware torque
metric that integrates structural distance and energy scores to quantify the
perturbation induced by edges, thereby encouraging each node to aggregate
information from its nearest low-energy neighbors. We use the metric to
hierarchically reconfigure the receptive field of each layer by judiciously
pruning high-torque edges and adding low-torque links, suppressing propagation
noise and boosting pertinent signals. Extensive evaluations on benchmark
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on both
heterophilous and homophilous graphs, and maintains high accuracy on noisy
graph.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemShare reduces memory overhead in Large Reasoning Models by reusing similar KV cache blocks, improving throughput by 84.79% without losing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs generate redundant intermediate reasoning steps, causing memory inefficiency. MemShare addresses this by reusing similar KV cache states.

Method: Uses collaborative filtering to identify reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero-copy reuse.

Result: Achieves up to 84.79% throughput improvement while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: MemShare effectively optimizes memory usage in LRMs, enhancing performance without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved significant advances in
mathematical reasoning and formal logic tasks. However, their tendency to
generate lengthy chain-of-thought sequences leads to substantial memory
overhead during inference. We observe that LRMs frequently produce highly
similar intermediate reasoning steps, which correspond to similar KV cache
states across layers. Motivated by this observation, we propose MemShare, a
novel KV cache management approach that effectively reduces memory overhead.
MemShare employs a collaborative filtering algorithm to efficiently identify
reusable KV cache blocks and enables zero copy cache reuse to significantly
reduce memory overhead, improve throughput while maintaining accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that MemShare delivers up to 84.79\%
improvement in throughput while maintaining better accuracy compared to
existing KV cache management methods.

TL;DR: Proposes PVD-Net and PVD-ONet frameworks for solving singularly perturbed PDEs without data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the failure of physics-informed neural networks in singularly perturbed problems.

Method: Two versions of PVD-Net (stability-focused and high-accuracy) and PVD-ONet for operator learning, using Prandtl's and Van Dyke's matching principles.

Result: Numerical experiments show superior performance over baselines in multi-scale problems.

Conclusion: PVD-Net and PVD-ONet offer effective solutions for singularly perturbed PDEs, enhancing stability and accuracy.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and Physics-informed DeepONet excel in
solving partial differential equations; however, they often fail to converge
for singularly perturbed problems. To address this, we propose two novel
frameworks, Prandtl-Van Dyke neural network (PVD-Net) and its operator learning
extension Prandtl-Van Dyke Deep Operator Network (PVD-ONet), which rely solely
on governing equations without data. To address varying task-specific
requirements, both PVD-Net and PVD-ONet are developed in two distinct versions,
tailored respectively for stability-focused and high-accuracy modeling. The
leading-order PVD-Net adopts a two-network architecture combined with Prandtl's
matching condition, targeting stability-prioritized scenarios. The high-order
PVD-Net employs a five-network design with Van Dyke's matching principle to
capture fine-scale boundary layer structures, making it ideal for high-accuracy
scenarios. PVD-ONet generalizes PVD-Net to the operator learning setting by
assembling multiple DeepONet modules, directly mapping initial conditions to
solution operators and enabling instant predictions for an entire family of
boundary layer problems without retraining. Numerical experiments on various
models show that our proposed methods consistently outperform existing
baselines under various error metrics, thereby offering a powerful new approach
for multi-scale problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RAGDP is a novel framework that speeds up Diffusion Policies (DPs) by using a knowledge base of expert demonstrations, avoiding additional training and improving accuracy-speed trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPs are slow due to multiple noise removal steps, and existing solutions like CP require extensive training. RAGDP aims to address these issues without extra training.

Method: RAGDP constructs a vector database of expert demonstrations using a DP encoder. During inference, it retrieves the most similar expert action for the current observation and combines it with intermediate noise removal to reduce steps.

Result: RAGDP improves accuracy and speed, maintaining a 7% accuracy advantage over CP even at 20x acceleration.

Conclusion: RAGDP offers a training-free solution to enhance DPs, balancing speed and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: Diffusion Policies (DPs) have attracted attention for their ability to
achieve significant accuracy improvements in various imitation learning tasks.
However, DPs depend on Diffusion Models, which require multiple noise removal
steps to generate a single action, resulting in long generation times. To solve
this problem, knowledge distillation-based methods such as Consistency Policy
(CP) have been proposed. However, these methods require a significant amount of
training time, especially for difficult tasks. In this study, we propose RAGDP
(Retrieve-Augmented Generation for Diffusion Policies) as a novel framework
that eliminates the need for additional training using a knowledge base to
expedite the inference of pre-trained DPs. In concrete, RAGDP encodes
observation-action pairs through the DP encoder to construct a vector database
of expert demonstrations. During inference, the current observation is
embedded, and the most similar expert action is extracted. This extracted
action is combined with an intermediate noise removal step to reduce the number
of steps required compared to the original diffusion step. We show that by
using RAGDP with the base model and existing acceleration methods, we improve
the accuracy and speed trade-off with no additional training. Even when
accelerating the models 20 times, RAGDP maintains an advantage in accuracy,
with a 7% increase over distillation models such as CP.

Motivation: Little attention has been given to how agents with finite memory and compute resources should allocate these for optimal performance.

Method: The paper derives a solution for the capacity-constrained LQG sequential prediction problem and demonstrates optimal capacity allocation for decomposable sub-problems in steady state.

Result: A solution for the LQG problem under capacity constraints is derived, and optimal steady-state capacity allocation for decomposable sub-problems is shown.

Conclusion: This work is a foundational step in systematically studying learning under capacity constraints.

Abstract: Any agents we can possibly build are subject to capacity constraints, as
memory and compute resources are inherently finite. However, comparatively
little attention has been dedicated to understanding how agents with limited
capacity should allocate their resources for optimal performance. The goal of
this paper is to shed some light on this question by studying a simple yet
relevant continual learning problem: the capacity-constrained
linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) sequential prediction problem. We derive a
solution to this problem under appropriate technical conditions. Moreover, for
problems that can be decomposed into a set of sub-problems, we also demonstrate
how to optimally allocate capacity across these sub-problems in the steady
state. We view the results of this paper as a first step in the systematic
theoretical study of learning under capacity constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latte is a framework for test-time adaptation in decentralized settings, using local and external memories to enhance model performance while minimizing communication costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time adaptation methods struggle with limited data in decentralized settings and lack personalization for individual clients.

Method: Latte uses local and external memories to store historical test data and class prototypes, leveraging embedding similarity and uncertainty for adaptation.

Result: Latte outperforms existing methods in decentralized settings with negligible added costs.

Conclusion: Latte effectively addresses distribution shifts in decentralized environments, balancing personalization and robustness.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation with pre-trained vision-language models has gained
increasing attention for addressing distribution shifts during testing. Among
these approaches, memory-based algorithms stand out due to their training-free
nature and ability to leverage historical test data. However, existing
test-time adaptation methods are typically designed for a single domain with
abundant data. In decentralized settings such as federated learning, applying
these methods individually to each client suffers from limited test data, while
directly sharing a single global memory via the server prevents proper
personalization to each client's unique distribution. To address this, we
propose Latte, a novel framework where each client maintains a local memory to
store embeddings from its own historical test data and an external memory to
store class prototypes from other relevant clients. During communication, each
client retrieves prototypes from similar clients under the server's
coordination to expand its memory. For local adaptation, Latte utilizes both
embedding similarity and uncertainty to enhance model performance. Our
theoretical analysis shows that Latte effectively leverages in-distribution
clients while remaining robust to out-of-distribution clients. Extensive
experiments on domain adaptation and corruption benchmarks validate that Latte
achieves superior performance in decentralized settings, while introducing only
negligible communication and computation costs. Our code is available at

enterprise-specific challenges, such as role-based access to data, the need for
reliability guarantees, dynamic and long-horizon interactions, and compliance,
which are often overlooked in current research. We also identify future
research directions, including holistic, more realistic, and scalable

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical SDE model is proposed to uncover low-dimensional manifolds in high-dimensional neural time series, balancing efficiency and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for modeling neural time series lack a balance between computational efficiency and interpretability.

Method: The model uses Brownian bridge SDEs and a multivariate marked point process to reconstruct manifold trajectories, mapping them to observed data.

Result: The model accurately recovers manifold structure and scales linearly with data dimensionality, validated on synthetic and neural data.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical SDE model effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a scalable and interpretable solution.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional neural time series lie
on a low-dimensional manifold shaped by simpler underlying dynamics. To uncover
this structure, latent dynamical variable models such as state-space models,
recurrent neural networks, neural ordinary differential equations, and Gaussian
Process Latent Variable Models are widely used. We propose a novel hierarchical
stochastic differential equation (SDE) model that balances computational
efficiency and interpretability, addressing key limitations of existing
methods. Our model assumes the trajectory of a manifold can be reconstructed
from a sparse set of samples from the manifold trajectory. The latent space is
modeled using Brownian bridge SDEs, with points - specified in both time and
value - sampled from a multivariate marked point process. These Brownian
bridges define the drift of a second set of SDEs, which are then mapped to the
observed data. This yields a continuous, differentiable latent process capable
of modeling arbitrarily complex time series as the number of manifold points
increases. We derive training and inference procedures and show that the
computational cost of inference scales linearly with the length of the
observation data. We then validate our model on both synthetic data and neural
recordings to demonstrate that it accurately recovers the underlying manifold
structure and scales effectively with data dimensionality.

TL;DR: A simple neural network output (categorical probability distribution) is effective for next spike prediction, challenging the underuse of this structure in neural temporal point process models. Existing datasets often lack revealing information, and model performance is influenced by regularization. Extended and new datasets show the categorical distribution's competitiveness.


<details>

Motivation: Investigate why simple categorical probability distributions are underused in neural temporal point process models for next spike prediction.

Method: Use a simple neural network output (categorical distribution) for next spike prediction, analyze existing datasets, and extend/create new datasets to test the approach.

Result: The categorical distribution performs competitively across datasets, revealing limitations in existing datasets and models.

Conclusion: Simple categorical outputs are effective and competitive, suggesting reevaluation of output structures in temporal point process models.

Abstract: We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a simple neural network output, a
categorical probability distribution, for the task of next spike prediction.
This case study motivates an investigation into why this simple output
structure is not commonly used with neural temporal point process models. We
find evidence that many existing datasets for evaluating temporal point process
models do not reveal much information about the underlying event generating
processes, and many existing models perform well due to regularization effects
of model size and constraints on output structure. We extend existing datasets
and create new ones in order to explore outside of this information limited
regime and find that outputting a simple categorical distribution is
competitive across a wide range of datasets.

Result: Outperforms Euclidean models on 37/42 benchmarks and state-of-the-art on 7 GUE datasets, with fewer parameters and no pretraining.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic framework is robust for genome representation learning, validated by benchmarks and empirical assessments.

Abstract: Current approaches to genomic sequence modeling often struggle to align the
inductive biases of machine learning models with the evolutionarily-informed
structure of biological systems. To this end, we formulate a novel application
of hyperbolic CNNs that exploits this structure, enabling more expressive DNA
sequence representations. Our strategy circumvents the need for explicit
phylogenetic mapping while discerning key properties of sequences pertaining to
core functional and regulatory behavior. Across 37 out of 42 genome
interpretation benchmark datasets, our hyperbolic models outperform their
Euclidean equivalents. Notably, our approach even surpasses state-of-the-art
performance on seven GUE benchmark datasets, consistently outperforming many
DNA language models while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and
avoiding pretraining. Our results include a novel set of benchmark
datasets--the Transposable Elements Benchmark--which explores a major but
understudied component of the genome with deep evolutionary significance. We
further motivate our work by exploring how our hyperbolic models recognize
genomic signal under various data-generating conditions and by constructing an
empirical method for interpreting the hyperbolicity of dataset embeddings.
Throughout these assessments, we find persistent evidence highlighting the
potential of our hyperbolic framework as a robust paradigm for genome
representation learning. Our code and benchmark datasets are available at

### [264] [DGP: A Dual-Granularity Prompting Framework for Fraud Detection with Graph-Enhanced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21653)
*Yuan Li,Jun Hu,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual Granularity Prompting (DGP) improves fraud detection by summarizing neighbor information into concise prompts, addressing information overload in heterogeneous graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-only prompting struggles with heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs due to exponential growth of multi-hop relations and dense textual information, degrading performance.

Method: DGP preserves fine-grained textual details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into coarse-grained prompts, using tailored summarization for different data modalities.

Result: DGP improves fraud detection performance by up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods while operating within a manageable token budget.

Conclusion: DGP demonstrates the potential of Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection by effectively managing information overload.

Abstract: Real-world fraud detection applications benefit from graph learning
techniques that jointly exploit node features, often rich in textual data, and
graph structural information. Recently, Graph-Enhanced LLMs emerge as a
promising graph learning approach that converts graph information into prompts,
exploiting LLMs' ability to reason over both textual and structural
information. Among them, text-only prompting, which converts graph information
to prompts consisting solely of text tokens, offers a solution that relies only
on LLM tuning without requiring additional graph-specific encoders. However,
text-only prompting struggles on heterogeneous fraud-detection graphs:
multi-hop relations expand exponentially with each additional hop, leading to
rapidly growing neighborhoods associated with dense textual information. These
neighborhoods may overwhelm the model with long, irrelevant content in the
prompt and suppress key signals from the target node, thereby degrading
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Dual Granularity Prompting
(DGP), which mitigates information overload by preserving fine-grained textual
details for the target node while summarizing neighbor information into
coarse-grained text prompts. DGP introduces tailored summarization strategies
for different data modalities, bi-level semantic abstraction for textual fields
and statistical aggregation for numerical features, enabling effective
compression of verbose neighbor content into concise, informative prompts.
Experiments across public and industrial datasets demonstrate that DGP operates
within a manageable token budget while improving fraud detection performance by
up to 6.8% (AUPRC) over state-of-the-art methods, showing the potential of
Graph-Enhanced LLMs for fraud detection.

### [265] [Probabilistic Consistency in Machine Learning and Its Connection to Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21670)
*Paul Patrone,Anthony Kearsley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the black-box nature of ML models, focusing on uncertainty quantification (UQ) and prevalence in classification. It introduces a level-set theory linking self-consistent ML models to class-conditional probability distributions, and derives properties of Bayes classifiers for UQ.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty in quantifying confidence in ML predictions and understanding how models abstract training data, by leveraging diagnostics and prevalence.

Method: Analyzes binary Bayes optimal classifiers, reinterprets their boundary sets as level-sets of density ratios, and parameterizes them by prevalence. Extends to multiclass cases with normalization and self-consistency conditions.

Result: Shows that certain ML models are equivalent to class-conditional distributions, and derives conditions for valid probabilistic interpretations. Provides a framework for UQ in ML.

Conclusion: The analysis connects ML models to probabilistic interpretations and offers a foundation for uncertainty quantification, enhancing interpretability and reliability.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is often viewed as a powerful data analysis tool that
is easy to learn because of its black-box nature. Yet this very nature also
makes it difficult to quantify confidence in predictions extracted from ML
models, and more fundamentally, to understand how such models are mathematical
abstractions of training data. The goal of this paper is to unravel these
issues and their connections to uncertainty quantification (UQ) by pursuing a
line of reasoning motivated by diagnostics. In such settings, prevalence - i.e.
the fraction of elements in class - is often of inherent interest. Here we
analyze the many interpretations of prevalence to derive a level-set theory of
classification, which shows that certain types of self-consistent ML models are
equivalent to class-conditional probability distributions. We begin by studying
the properties of binary Bayes optimal classifiers, recognizing that their
boundary sets can be reinterpreted as level-sets of pairwise density ratios. By
parameterizing Bayes classifiers in terms of the prevalence, we then show that
they satisfy important monotonicity and class-switching properties that can be
used to deduce the density ratios without direct access to the boundary sets.
Moreover, this information is sufficient for tasks such as constructing the
multiclass Bayes-optimal classifier and estimating inherent uncertainty in the
class assignments. In the multiclass case, we use these results to deduce
normalization and self-consistency conditions, the latter being equivalent to
the law of total probability for classifiers. We also show that these are
necessary conditions for arbitrary ML models to have valid probabilistic
interpretations. Throughout we demonstrate how this analysis informs the
broader task of UQ for ML via an uncertainty propagation framework.

*Hongwei Ma,Junbin Gao,Minh-Ngoc Tran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PREIG is a deep learning framework for commodity demand forecasting, combining GRU and PINN with economic constraints, outperforming traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of forecasting commodity demand due to market volatility, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically consistent predictions.

Method: Integrates GRU with PINN, embedding economic constraints via a customized loss function, and uses hybrid optimization (NAdam, L-BFGS, POP).

Result: Outperforms ARIMA, GARCH, BPNN, and RNN in RMSE and MAPE, maintaining explainability.

Conclusion: PREIG offers a robust, interpretable, and scalable solution for nonlinear time series forecasting in economics.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting commodity demand remains a critical challenge due to
volatile market dynamics, nonlinear dependencies, and the need for economically
consistent predictions. This paper introduces PREIG, a novel deep learning
framework tailored for commodity demand forecasting. The model uniquely
integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture with physics-informed
neural network (PINN) principles by embedding a domain-specific economic
constraint: the negative elasticity between price and demand. This constraint
is enforced through a customized loss function that penalizes violations of the
physical rule, ensuring that model predictions remain interpretable and aligned
with economic theory. To further enhance predictive performance and stability,
PREIG incorporates a hybrid optimization strategy that couples NAdam and L-BFGS
with Population-Based Training (POP). Experiments across multiple commodities
datasets demonstrate that PREIG significantly outperforms traditional
econometric models (ARIMA,GARCH) and deep learning baselines (BPNN,RNN) in both
RMSE and MAPE. When compared with GRU,PREIG maintains good explainability while
still performing well in prediction. By bridging domain knowledge, optimization
theory and deep learning, PREIG provides a robust, interpretable, and scalable
solution for high-dimensional nonlinear time series forecasting in economy.

*Gang Wang,Peng Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network extended corresponding state model is proposed to predict thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants, combining theoretical and data-driven methods for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hydrofluoroolefins are promising refrigerants with low global warming potential, but lack of thermodynamic data hinders their discovery and application.

Method: Integrates graph neural networks and specialized model architecture to predict residual thermodynamic properties, trained on accurate data and validated via leave-one-out cross-validation.

Result: Significantly improved accuracy for density and energy properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with low average absolute deviations.

Conclusion: The model effectively embeds physics knowledge into machine learning, accelerating the discovery of superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

Abstract: Hydrofluoroolefins are considered the most promising next-generation
refrigerants due to their extremely low global warming potential values, which
can effectively mitigate the global warming effect. However, the lack of
reliable thermodynamic data hinders the discovery and application of newer and
superior hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. In this work, integrating the
strengths of theoretical method and data-driven method, we proposed a neural
network extended corresponding state model to predict the residual
thermodynamic properties of hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants. The innovation is
that the fluids are characterized through their microscopic molecular
structures by the inclusion of graph neural network module and the specialized
design of model architecture to enhance its generalization ability. The
proposed model is trained using the highly accurate data of available known
fluids, and evaluated via the leave-one-out cross-validation method. Compared
to conventional extended corresponding state models or cubic equation of state,
the proposed model shows significantly improved accuracy for density and energy
properties in liquid and supercritical regions, with average absolute deviation
of 1.49% (liquid) and 2.42% (supercritical) for density, 3.37% and 2.50% for
residual entropy, 1.85% and 1.34% for residual enthalpy. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of embedding physics knowledge into the machine
learning model. The proposed neural network extended corresponding state model
is expected to significantly accelerate the discovery of novel
hydrofluoroolefin refrigerants.

*Huiqiang Chen,Tianqing Zhu,Xin Yu,Wanlei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ZS-PAG, a novel framework for zero-shot machine unlearning, addressing over-unlearning by approximating remaining data with adversarial samples, pinpointing a subspace for unlearning, and using influence-based pseudo-labeling to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of over-unlearning in machine unlearning when only unlearning samples are available (zero-shot scenario) motivates the need for a practical solution.

Method: ZS-PAG approximates remaining data with adversarial samples, identifies a subspace for unlearning, and employs influence-based pseudo-labeling to enhance performance.

Result: The method theoretically guarantees performance and outperforms baselines in experiments across benchmarks.

Conclusion: ZS-PAG effectively addresses zero-shot unlearning, preventing over-unlearning and improving model performance.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific samples from a
trained model. A key challenge in this process is over-unlearning, where the
model's performance on the remaining data significantly drops due to the change
in the model's parameters. Existing unlearning algorithms depend on the
remaining data to prevent this issue. As such, these methods are inapplicable
in a more practical scenario, where only the unlearning samples are available
(i.e., zero-shot unlearning). This paper presents a novel framework, ZS-PAG, to
fill this gap. Our approach offers three key innovations: (1) we approximate
the inaccessible remaining data by generating adversarial samples; (2)
leveraging the generated samples, we pinpoint a specific subspace to perform
the unlearning process, therefore preventing over-unlearning in the challenging
zero-shot scenario; and (3) we consider the influence of the unlearning process
on the remaining samples and design an influence-based pseudo-labeling
strategy. As a result, our method further improves the model's performance
after unlearning. The proposed method holds a theoretical guarantee, and
experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of
our proposed method over several baselines.

properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design
where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of retrosynthesis planning lies in the vast chemical reaction space, where traditional methods either lack scalability or risk invalid reactions. TempRe aims to bridge this gap.

Method: TempRe reformulates template-based retrosynthesis as sequence generation, enabling scalable and chemically plausible planning. It is evaluated on single-step and multi-step tasks, including the PaRoutes benchmark.

Result: TempRe outperforms template classification and SMILES-based methods, achieving high top-k route accuracy on PaRoutes. It also extends to direct multi-step synthesis.

Conclusion: TempRe demonstrates the potential of template generative modeling as an efficient and powerful paradigm for computer-aided synthesis planning.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning remains a central challenge in molecular discovery
due to the vast and complex chemical reaction space. While traditional
template-based methods offer tractability, they suffer from poor scalability
and limited generalization, and template-free generative approaches risk
generating invalid reactions. In this work, we propose TempRe, a generative
framework that reformulates template-based approaches as sequence generation,
enabling scalable, flexible, and chemically plausible retrosynthesis. We
evaluated TempRe across single-step and multi-step retrosynthesis tasks,
demonstrating its superiority over both template classification and
SMILES-based generation methods. On the PaRoutes multi-step benchmark, TempRe
achieves strong top-k route accuracy. Furthermore, we extend TempRe to direct
multi-step synthesis route generation, providing a lightweight and efficient
alternative to conventional single-step and search-based approaches. These
results highlight the potential of template generative modeling as a powerful
paradigm in computer-aided synthesis planning.

TL;DR: RF-CRATE is a mathematically interpretable deep network for RF sensing, extending white-box transformers to the complex domain with improved performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep wireless sensing models lack interpretability, limiting generalizability and raising security concerns.

Method: Extends white-box transformers to complex domain using CR-Calculus, introduces Subspace Regularization for feature diversity.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to black-box models, with 19.98% average improvement and 5.08% classification gain over CRATE.

Conclusion: RF-CRATE combines interpretability with high performance, advancing RF sensing with open-source availability.

Abstract: The empirical success of deep learning has spurred its application to the
radio-frequency (RF) domain, leading to significant advances in Deep Wireless
Sensing (DWS). However, most existing DWS models function as black boxes with
limited interpretability, which hampers their generalizability and raises
concerns in security-sensitive physical applications. In this work, inspired by
the remarkable advances of white-box transformers, we present RF-CRATE, the
first mathematically interpretable deep network architecture for RF sensing,
grounded in the principles of complex sparse rate reduction. To accommodate the
unique RF signals, we conduct non-trivial theoretical derivations that extend
the original real-valued white-box transformer to the complex domain. By
leveraging the CR-Calculus framework, we successfully construct a fully
complex-valued white-box transformer with theoretically derived self-attention
and residual multi-layer perceptron modules. Furthermore, to improve the
model's ability to extract discriminative features from limited wireless data,
we introduce Subspace Regularization, a novel regularization strategy that
enhances feature diversity, resulting in an average performance improvement of
19.98% across multiple sensing tasks. We extensively evaluate RF-CRATE against
seven baselines with multiple public and self-collected datasets involving
different RF signals. The results show that RF-CRATE achieves performance on
par with thoroughly engineered black-box models, while offering full
mathematical interpretability. More importantly, by extending CRATE to the
complex domain, RF-CRATE yields substantial improvements, achieving an average
classification gain of 5.08% and reducing regression error by 10.34% across
diverse sensing tasks compared to CRATE. RF-CRATE is fully open-sourced at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores Bayesian Optimization (BO) for optimizing Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects, comparing novel stochastic models to Gaussian Processes (GPs) in scenarios where GPs underperform. It highlights BO's potential to enhance CCS sustainability and economic viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve CCS project optimization by addressing limitations of traditional methods like GPs in complex scenarios, ensuring both sustainability and economic feasibility.

Method: Uses Bayesian Optimization with various stochastic models, including novel ones, to optimize decision variables in CCS projects, focusing on scenarios with many variables or multiple objectives.

Result: Demonstrates BO's effectiveness, especially with exotic stochastic models, in improving CCS project outcomes, balancing sustainability and economic metrics like Net Present Value (NPV).

Conclusion: BO, particularly with advanced stochastic models, is a promising tool for optimizing CCS projects, marking its first application in reservoir engineering for sustainability enhancement.

Abstract: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) stands as a pivotal technology for fostering
a sustainable future. The process, which involves injecting supercritical
CO$_2$ into underground formations, a method already widely used for Enhanced
Oil Recovery, serves a dual purpose: it not only curbs CO$_2$ emissions and
addresses climate change but also extends the operational lifespan and
sustainability of oil fields and platforms, easing the shift toward greener
practices. This paper delivers a thorough comparative evaluation of strategies
for optimizing decision variables in CCS project development, employing a
derivative-free technique known as Bayesian Optimization. In addition to
Gaussian Processes, which usually serve as the gold standard in BO, various
novel stochastic models were examined and compared within a BO framework. This
research investigates the effectiveness of utilizing more exotic stochastic
models than GPs for BO in environments where GPs have been shown to
underperform, such as in cases with a large number of decision variables or
multiple objective functions that are not similarly scaled. By incorporating
Net Present Value (NPV) as a key objective function, the proposed framework
demonstrates its potential to improve economic viability while ensuring the
sustainable deployment of CCS technologies. Ultimately, this study represents
the first application in the reservoir engineering industry of the growing body
of BO research, specifically in the search for more appropriate stochastic
models, highlighting its potential as a preferred method for enhancing
sustainability in the energy sector.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) using effective-field-theory to explain their stability, generalization, and frequency behavior, revealing how nonlinear activations and architecture choices impact performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled explanation for the stability, generalization, and frequency behavior of FNOs, which are widely used for solving high-dimensional PDEs but lack theoretical understanding.

Method: The study employs effective-field-theory analysis in infinite-dimensional function space, deriving recursion relations for layer kernels and vertices, and examines analytic activations, scale-invariant cases, and residual connections.

Result: Nonlinear activations couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes, and criticality conditions for weight initialization are derived. Experiments confirm frequency transfer and validate predictions.

Conclusion: The analysis explains how nonlinearity enables FNOs to capture non-trivial features, provides hyper-parameter selection criteria, and highlights the benefits of scale-invariant activations and residual connections.

Abstract: Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have emerged as leading surrogates for
high-dimensional partial-differential equations, yet their stability,
generalization and frequency behavior lack a principled explanation. We present
the first systematic effective-field-theory analysis of FNOs in an
infinite-dimensional function space, deriving closed recursion relations for
the layer kernel and four-point vertex and then examining three practically
important settings-analytic activations, scale-invariant cases and
architectures with residual connections. The theory shows that nonlinear
activations inevitably couple frequency inputs to high-frequency modes that are
otherwise discarded by spectral truncation, and experiments confirm this
frequency transfer. For wide networks we obtain explicit criticality conditions
on the weight-initialization ensemble that keep small input perturbations to
have uniform scale across depth, and empirical tests validate these
predictions. Taken together, our results quantify how nonlinearity enables
neural operators to capture non-trivial features, supply criteria for
hyper-parameter selection via criticality analysis, and explain why
scale-invariant activations and residual connections enhance feature learning
in FNOs.

*Rahul Golder,M. M. Faruque Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised method for discovering interpretable ODE models from noisy data, using spline transformations and gradient matrices for accurate, sparse solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data-driven models often lack interpretability and physical meaning, failing to represent true system physics.

Method: Uses an approximate general solution and spline transformation to linearly estimate ODE coefficients, leveraging gradient matrices for robustness to noise.

Result: Achieves high-accuracy, sparse ODE models without regularization, even with noisy data.

Conclusion: The method enables practical, data-driven discovery of physical phenomena in real experimental settings.

Abstract: The data-driven discovery of interpretable models approximating the
underlying dynamics of a physical system has gained attraction in the past
decade. Current approaches employ pre-specified functional forms or basis
functions and often result in models that lack physical meaning and
interpretability, let alone represent the true physics of the system. We
propose an unsupervised parameter estimation methodology that first finds an
approximate general solution, followed by a spline transformation to linearly
estimate the coefficients of the governing ordinary differential equation
(ODE). The approximate general solution is postulated using the same functional
form as the analytical solution of a general homogeneous, linear,
constant-coefficient ODE. An added advantage is its ability to produce a
high-fidelity, smooth functional form even in the presence of noisy data. The
spline approximation obtains gradient information from the functional form
which are linearly independent and creates the basis of the gradient matrix.
This gradient matrix is used in a linear system to find the coefficients of the
ODEs. From the case studies, we observed that our modeling approach discovers
ODEs with high accuracy and also promotes sparsity in the solution without
using any regularization techniques. The methodology is also robust to noisy
data and thus allows the integration of data-driven techniques into real
experimental setting for data-driven learning of physical phenomena.

Motivation: Proteins often adopt multiple conformational states for critical biological functions, but existing multi-state design methods perform poorly compared to single-state approaches.

Method: DynamicMPNN is trained on 46,033 conformational pairs covering 75% of CATH superfamilies and evaluated using AlphaFold initial guess.

Result: DynamicMPNN outperforms ProteinMPNN by up to 13% on structure-normalized RMSD in multi-state protein benchmarks.

Conclusion: DynamicMPNN advances multi-state protein design by explicitly training for conformational diversity, offering higher experimental success rates.

Abstract: Structural biology has long been dominated by the one sequence, one

enzyme catalysis to membrane transport - depend on proteins that adopt multiple

on vast text data to learn general language patterns, but a subsequent
post-training phase is critical to align them for specific real-world tasks.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is the leading post-training technique, yet its
economic impact remains largely underexplored and unquantified. We examine this
question through the lens of the first deployment of an RL-trained LLM for
generative advertising on Facebook. Integrated into Meta's Text Generation
feature, our model, "AdLlama," powers an AI tool that helps advertisers create
new variations of human-written ad text. To train this model, we introduce
reinforcement learning with performance feedback (RLPF), a post-training method
that uses historical ad performance data as a reward signal. In a large-scale
10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad
variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7%
(p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads.
This represents a substantial improvement in advertiser return on investment on
Facebook. We also find that advertisers who used AdLlama generated more ad
variations, indicating higher satisfaction with the model's outputs. To our
knowledge, this is the largest study to date on the use of generative AI in an
ecologically valid setting, offering an important data point quantifying the
tangible impact of RL post-training. Furthermore, the results show that RLPF is
a promising and generalizable approach for metric-driven post-training that
bridges the gap between highly capable language models and tangible outcomes.

### [279] [R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17307)
*Zhuokun Chen,Zeren Chen,Jiahao He,Mingkui Tan,Jianfei Cai,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Stitch accelerates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by dynamically switching between small and large language models based on token-level confidence, reducing latency by 85% with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT reasoning improves problem-solving but introduces computational overhead. Existing acceleration methods have limitations, such as speculative decoding's inefficiency when small and large models disagree.

Method: R-Stitch uses a hybrid decoding framework where a small model generates tokens by default, delegating to the large model only when confidence is low, avoiding full-sequence rollback.

Result: Experiments show R-Stitch reduces inference latency by up to 85% with negligible accuracy drop on math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: R-Stitch is a practical, model-agnostic solution for efficient CoT reasoning, balancing speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation from multiple heterogeneous teachers improves adversarial example transferability, matching ensemble baselines while reducing generation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple teachers can enhance adversarial example transferability and efficiency.

Method: Train a lightweight student model using curriculum-based switching and joint optimization KD strategies with ResNet50 and DenseNet-161 as teachers. Generate adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, evaluated against GoogLeNet.

Result: Student models achieve attack success rates comparable to ensemble baselines, with up to 6x faster generation time. Lower temperature and hard-label supervision boost transferability.

Conclusion: KD is effective not only for model compression but also for improving black-box adversarial attack efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: We investigate whether knowledge distillation (KD) from multiple
heterogeneous teacher models can enhance the generation of transferable
adversarial examples. A lightweight student model is trained using two KD
strategies: curriculum-based switching and joint optimization, with ResNet50
and DenseNet-161 as teachers. The trained student is then used to generate
adversarial examples using FG, FGS, and PGD attacks, which are evaluated
against a black-box target model (GoogLeNet). Our results show that student
models distilled from multiple teachers achieve attack success rates comparable
to ensemble-based baselines, while reducing adversarial example generation time
by up to a factor of six. An ablation study further reveals that lower
temperature settings and the inclusion of hard-label supervision significantly
enhance transferability. These findings suggest that KD can serve not only as a
model compression technique but also as a powerful tool for improving the
efficiency and effectiveness of black-box adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: A machine learning approach using mineral element profiles to classify honey's floral and geographical sources, with Random Forests achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify honey's botanical and geographical origins using mineral element profiles for authenticity and traceability.

Method: Two-step process: preprocessing (missing-value treatment, normalization) and classification (supervised models, tested on a public dataset).

Result: Mineral elements are discriminative; Random Forests achieved 99.30% accuracy for botanical and 98.01% for geographical classification.

Conclusion: Mineral element profiles are effective for honey source classification, with Random Forests outperforming other models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for identifying honey
floral and geographical sources using mineral element profiles. The proposed
method comprises two steps: preprocessing and classification. The preprocessing
phase involves missing-value treatment and data normalization. In the
classification phase, we employ various supervised classification models for
discriminating between six botanical sources and 13 geographical origins of
honey. We test the classifiers' performance on a publicly available honey
mineral element dataset. The dataset contains mineral element profiles of
honeys from various floral and geographical origins. Results show that mineral
element content in honey provides discriminative information useful for
classifying honey botanical and geographical sources. Results also show that
the Random Forests (RF) classifier obtains the best performance on this
dataset, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 99.30% for classifying honey
botanical origins and 98.01% for classifying honey geographical origins.

TL;DR: The paper explores Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for inventory management, showing competitive performance against benchmarks and heuristics with minimal tuning. It introduces a Structure-Informed Policy Network for better interpretability and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between data-driven learning and analytical insights in inventory management, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand distributions.

Method: Applies a DRL algorithm (DirectBackprop) to various inventory scenarios, using historical data. Introduces Structure-Informed Policy Network to incorporate analytical insights.

Result: DRL performs competitively or outperforms benchmarks, capturing known structural properties of optimal policies. The proposed technique improves interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: DRL effectively combines data-driven and analytical approaches in inventory management, maintaining practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to classical inventory management problems, with a focus on practical
implementation considerations. We apply a DRL algorithm based on DirectBackprop
to several fundamental inventory management scenarios including multi-period
systems with lost sales (with and without lead times), perishable inventory
management, dual sourcing, and joint inventory procurement and removal. The DRL
approach learns policies across products using only historical information that
would be available in practice, avoiding unrealistic assumptions about demand
distributions or access to distribution parameters. We demonstrate that our
generic DRL implementation performs competitively against or outperforms
established benchmarks and heuristics across these diverse settings, while
requiring minimal parameter tuning. Through examination of the learned
policies, we show that the DRL approach naturally captures many known
structural properties of optimal policies derived from traditional operations
research methods. To further improve policy performance and interpretability,
we propose a Structure-Informed Policy Network technique that explicitly
incorporates analytically-derived characteristics of optimal policies into the
learning process. This approach can help interpretability and add robustness to
the policy in out-of-sample performance, as we demonstrate in an example with
realistic demand data. Finally, we provide an illustrative application of DRL
in a non-stationary setting. Our work bridges the gap between data-driven
learning and analytical insights in inventory management while maintaining
practical applicability.

*Haley Rosso,Lars Ruthotto,Khachik Sargsyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores weight parameterization strategies for neural ODEs and ResNets using polynomial bases, finding Legendre polynomials improve stability and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training continuous-time deep learning models like neural ODEs requires expressive yet stable time-varying weights, especially under computational constraints.

Method: The study evaluates monomial and Legendre polynomial bases in neural ODE and ResNet architectures, comparing discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.

Result: Legendre polynomials yield more stable training, lower computational costs, and comparable or better accuracy than monomials or unconstrained weights.

Conclusion: Orthogonal polynomial bases, like Legendre, offer a favorable balance between expressivity and training efficiency for time-dependent weight parameterization.

Abstract: Continuous-time deep learning models, such as neural ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), offer a promising framework for surrogate modeling of complex
physical systems. A central challenge in training these models lies in learning
expressive yet stable time-varying weights, particularly under computational
constraints. This work investigates weight parameterization strategies that
constrain the temporal evolution of weights to a low-dimensional subspace
spanned by polynomial basis functions. We evaluate both monomial and Legendre
polynomial bases within neural ODE and residual network (ResNet) architectures
under discretize-then-optimize and optimize-then-discretize training paradigms.
Experimental results across three high-dimensional benchmark problems show that
Legendre parameterizations yield more stable training dynamics, reduce
computational cost, and achieve accuracy comparable to or better than both
monomial parameterizations and unconstrained weight models. These findings
elucidate the role of basis choice in time-dependent weight parameterization
and demonstrate that using orthogonal polynomial bases offers a favorable
tradeoff between model expressivity and training efficiency.

*Wei Yang,Defu Cao,Yan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified ensemble framework improves sales forecasting in supply chains by combining Hierarchical Ensemble (HE) and Architectural Ensemble (AE) strategies, outperforming baselines and enhancing generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand forecasting is challenging due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts, and evolving external factors. Existing foundation models lack flexibility and robustness under distributional changes.

Method: Proposes HE for localized pattern capture by semantic levels and AE for integrating diverse model backbones to reduce bias and improve stability.

Result: Outperforms baselines on M5 benchmark and external datasets, improving accuracy across hierarchical levels and zero-shot forecasting.

Conclusion: The framework effectively boosts generalization in complex forecasting environments.

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for supply chain optimization, yet
remains difficult in practice due to hierarchical complexity, domain shifts,
and evolving external factors. While recent foundation models offer strong
potential for time series forecasting, they often suffer from architectural
rigidity and limited robustness under distributional change. In this paper, we
propose a unified ensemble framework that enhances the performance of
foundation models for sales forecasting in real-world supply chains. Our method
combines two complementary strategies: (1) Hierarchical Ensemble (HE), which
partitions training and inference by semantic levels (e.g., store, category,
department) to capture localized patterns; and (2) Architectural Ensemble (AE),
which integrates predictions from diverse model backbones to mitigate bias and
improve stability. We conduct extensive experiments on the M5 benchmark and
three external sales datasets, covering both in-domain and zero-shot
forecasting. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms strong
baselines, improves accuracy across hierarchical levels, and provides a simple
yet effective mechanism for boosting generalization in complex forecasting
environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: iHOMER is an online multi-label learning framework that dynamically clusters labels and adapts to concept drift, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-label data streams like evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, and concept drift affecting label correlations.

Method: Uses incremental divisive-agglomerative clustering and a global tree-based learner with drift detection at global and local levels.

Result: Outperforms 5 global baselines by 23% and 12 local baselines by 32% in experiments on 23 datasets.

Conclusion: iHOMER is robust for online multi-label classification, effectively handling non-stationarity and label dependencies.

Abstract: Mining data streams with multi-label outputs poses significant challenges due
to evolving distributions, high-dimensional label spaces, sparse label
occurrences, and complex label dependencies. Moreover, concept drift affects
not only input distributions but also label correlations and imbalance ratios
over time, complicating model adaptation. To address these challenges,
structured learners are categorized into local and global methods. Local
methods break down the task into simpler components, while global methods adapt
the algorithm to the full output space, potentially yielding better predictions
by exploiting label correlations. This work introduces iHOMER (Incremental
Hierarchy Of Multi-label Classifiers), an online multi-label learning framework
that incrementally partitions the label space into disjoint, correlated
clusters without relying on predefined hierarchies. iHOMER leverages online
divisive-agglomerative clustering based on \textit{Jaccard} similarity and a
global tree-based learner driven by a multivariate \textit{Bernoulli} process
to guide instance partitioning. To address non-stationarity, it integrates
drift detection mechanisms at both global and local levels, enabling dynamic
restructuring of label partitions and subtrees. Experiments across 23
real-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global
baselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\%, and 12 local
baselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and
ADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\%, establishing its robustness for
online multi-label classification.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: A unified ML framework predicts alloy microstructure evolution under elastic fields, extracting parameters and forecasting further changes, validated via phase field simulations and neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of predicting temporal microstructure evolution in alloys under elastic fields, enabling simultaneous parameter extraction and future state prediction.

Method: Uses convolutional recurrent neural networks to analyze short trajectories, predict evolution, and infer elastic parameters, validated against phase field simulations.

Result: Accurate predictions of microstructure evolution and misfit conditions, scalability to larger domains, and mild extrapolation errors for longer time sequences.

Conclusion: The framework is generalizable beyond the tested system, with potential applications in inferring unknown parameters from experimental data.

Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently
tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of
an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of
elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further
microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by
focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta,
and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution
supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable
convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be
performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of
misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and
the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical
conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational
domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five
times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The
proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific,
prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental
videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating
further temporal evolution.

TL;DR: An AI strategy reduces data needed for designing synthetic sequence-controlled polymers by using a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data, enabling predictions under varied conditions with minimal additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing synthetic sequence-controlled polymers is challenging due to lack of extensive datasets. The study aims to accelerate design by reducing data requirements.

Method: A deep neural network is trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one condition and tuned for higher-fidelity predictions at other conditions.

Result: The approach allows a single low-fidelity dataset to enhance predictions across related systems, reducing the need for extensive data.

Conclusion: This priming-and-tuning method could revolutionize polymer design and enable AI-driven insights from coarse simulations for atomistic design.

Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science
by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise
sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of
these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the
massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of
proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to
dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials'
design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a
\emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension
between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules,
which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling,
depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the
polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset
to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network
trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one
set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a
distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be
needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity
parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire
constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an
approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from
fast, coarse simulations.

Motivation: To explore sustainable alternatives to power-hungry AI applications by leveraging differentiating neurons, which are active only during input changes.

Method: A small-world graph of differentiating neurons is used as a reservoir computing substrate, with optimized coupling strength and network topology.

Result: The approach achieves 90.65% accuracy on the MNIST digit recognition task, comparable to existing reservoir computing methods.

Conclusion: Differentiating neurons offer a viable and sustainable alternative to integrating neurons in reservoir computing, with potential for energy-efficient AI applications.

Abstract: Reservoir Computing is a machine learning approach that uses the rich
repertoire of complex system dynamics for function approximation. Current
approaches to reservoir computing use a network of coupled integrating neurons
that require a steady current to maintain activity. Here, we introduce a small
world graph of differentiating neurons that are active only when there are
changes in input as an alternative to integrating neurons as a reservoir
computing substrate. We find the coupling strength and network topology that
enable these small world networks to function as an effective reservoir. We
demonstrate the efficacy of these networks in the MNIST digit recognition task,
achieving comparable performance of 90.65% to existing reservoir computing
approaches. The findings suggest that differentiating neurons can be a
potential alternative to integrating neurons and can provide a sustainable
future alternative for power-hungry AI applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RNNs rely on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting interpretability and long-range dependency modeling. Biological systems use explicit, associative memory traces (engrams), motivating the ENN design.

Method: The ENN incorporates an explicit memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity and sparse, attention-driven retrieval, modeling memory formation and recall dynamically.

Result: ENN matches classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and WikiText-103 tasks while offering better interpretability through observable memory dynamics.

Conclusion: The ENN demonstrates the potential of neuroscience-inspired mechanisms for creating interpretable and robust deep learning models.

Abstract: Despite success across diverse tasks, current artificial recurrent network
architectures rely primarily on implicit hidden-state memories, limiting their
interpretability and ability to model long-range dependencies. In contrast,
biological neural systems employ explicit, associative memory traces (i.e.,
engrams) strengthened through Hebbian synaptic plasticity and activated
sparsely during recall. Motivated by these neurobiological insights, we
introduce the Engram Neural Network (ENN), a novel recurrent architecture
incorporating an explicit, differentiable memory matrix with Hebbian plasticity
and sparse, attention-driven retrieval mechanisms. The ENN explicitly models
memory formation and recall through dynamic Hebbian traces, improving
transparency and interpretability compared to conventional RNN variants. We
evaluate the ENN architecture on three canonical benchmarks: MNIST digit
classification, CIFAR-10 image sequence modeling, and WikiText-103 language
modeling. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ENN achieves accuracy and
generalization performance broadly comparable to classical RNN, GRU, and LSTM
architectures, with all models converging to similar accuracy and perplexity on
the large-scale WikiText-103 task. At the same time, the ENN offers significant
enhancements in interpretability through observable memory dynamics. Hebbian
trace visualizations further reveal biologically plausible, structured memory
formation processes, validating the potential of neuroscience-inspired
mechanisms to inform the development of more interpretable and robust deep
learning models.

It simplifies tactile sensing with a scalable, single-material process and integrates with neural networks for accurate force and contact prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to navigate dynamic environments through tactile sensing, addressing limitations of complex conventional methods.

Method: Fabrication of a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels (fluidic innervation), characterization of sensor response, geometric modeling, neural network training for force/contact prediction, and integration with an admittance controller.

Result: The sensor demonstrates robustness, adaptability, and durability, enabling accurate tactile feedback and environment exploration.

Conclusion: Fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, and durable tactile sensing solution, expanding possibilities for robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass method to improve heading accuracy in low-cost gyroscopes, outperforming existing approaches by 26% and 15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate heading is crucial for navigation, but low-cost gyroscopes face challenges due to noise and lack of external aids.

Method: Combines a diffusion-based denoiser with a learning-based heading estimation model to process raw inertial signals.

Result: Improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% over model-based and 15% over other learning methods.

Conclusion: The approach enhances navigation accuracy for autonomous platforms using low-cost gyroscopes.

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and
reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

*Ryo Terajima,Katsuma Inoue,Kohei Nakajima,Yasuo Kuniyoshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper explores using physical reservoir computing (PRC) to control multiple behaviors in a soft tensegrity robot, revealing untrained attractors in its dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend PRC for embedding multiple behaviors in soft robots and understand their untrained dynamics for embodied cognition.

Method: Simulation study of a tensegrity robot, analyzing its multistable dynamics and untrained attractors.

Result: The system exhibits untrained attractors reflecting intrinsic robot-environment interactions, offering insights into embodied cognition.

Conclusion: PRC's untrained attractors have potential to advance understanding of embodied AI and cognition.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

### [295] [Decision Transformer-Based Drone Trajectory Planning with Dynamic Safety-Efficiency Trade-Offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21506)
*Chang-Hun Ji,SiWoon Song,Youn-Hee Han,SungTae Moon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Decision Transformer-based drone trajectory planner uses Return-to-Go (RTG) as a single parameter to dynamically adjust safety-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming traditional and reinforcement learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional polynomial-based planners require expert tuning and may fail to achieve desired trade-offs, while reinforcement learning lacks explicit trade-off adjustment.

Method: Proposes a Decision Transformer-based planner using RTG as a temperature parameter for intuitive trade-off adjustment.

Result: Validated in simulations and real-world, the planner dynamically adjusts trade-offs and outperforms baselines in safety and efficiency.

Conclusion: The RTG-based planner is reliable, practical, and simplifies trade-off adjustment without expert knowledge.

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes unifying imitation learning and planning by replacing the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent, improving efficiency, generalization, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, necessitating reliable planning behavior in imitation learning.

Method: The approach replaces the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent, connecting it to Adversarial Imitation Learning for end-to-end learning from observation-only demonstrations.

Result: The method shows improvements in sample efficiency, out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness, validated in simulated and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The unified approach offers interpretability, complexity reduction, and safety benefits while outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,
out-of-distribution generalization, and robustness. The study includes
evaluations in both simulated control benchmarks and real-world navigation
experiments using few-to-single observation-only demonstrations.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MoDeSuite introduces a benchmark for mobile manipulation of deformable objects, addressing a gap in robot learning. It includes eight tasks, evaluates RL and imitation learning, and demonstrates sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on rigid objects, leaving a gap for deformable object manipulation in mobile robotics.

Method: Developed MoDeSuite with eight tasks, trained RL and imitation learning algorithms, and tested sim-to-real transfer.

Result: Demonstrated performance in simulation and real-world deployment with Spot robot, highlighting challenges.

Conclusion: MoDeSuite opens new research in mobile manipulation of deformable objects, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

*Wenbo Liu,Forbes Hou,Jon Zhang,Hong Liu,Allen Lei*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) to enhance chip verification using generative AI, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-LLM approaches are limited in complex chip verification tasks, a critical bottleneck in chip design.

Method: MAVF employs multiple specialized agents for automated transformation from design specs to testbench, covering parsing, strategy generation, and code implementation.

Result: MAVF excels in verification document parsing, generation, and testbench automation compared to manual and single-AI methods.

Conclusion: MAVF advances generative AI in verification automation, offering solutions to chip design bottlenecks.

Abstract: As large language models demonstrate enormous potential in the field of
Electronic Design Automation (EDA), generative AI-assisted chip design is
attracting widespread attention from academia and industry. Although these
technologies have made preliminary progress in tasks such as code generation,
their application in chip verification -- a critical bottleneck in the chip
development cycle -- remains at an exploratory stage. This paper proposes an
innovative Multi-Agent Verification Framework (MAVF) aimed at addressing the
limitations of current single-LLM approaches in complex verification tasks. Our
framework builds an automated transformation system from design specifications
to testbench through the collaborative work of multiple specialized agents,
including specification parsing, verification strategy generation, and code
implementation. Through verification experiments on multiple chip modules of
varying complexity, results show that MAVF significantly outperforms
traditional manual methods and single-dialogue generative AI approaches in
verification document parsing and generation, as well as automated testbench
generation. This research opens new directions for exploring generative AI
applications in verification automation, potentially providing effective
approaches to solving the most challenging bottleneck issues in chip design.

### [299] [On Policy Stochasticity in Mutual Information Optimal Control of Linear Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21543)
*Shoju Enami,Kenji Kashima*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores the relationship between the temperature parameter and policy stochasticity in mutual information optimal control (MIOCP) for discrete-time linear systems, extending prior work and deriving conditions for stochastic and deterministic policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the unexplored relationship between the temperature parameter and policy stochasticity in MIOCP, unlike in maximum entropy optimal control.

Method: Extends prior MIOCP results, establishes optimal policy existence, and derives conditions for stochastic/deterministic policies under temperature variations. Also analyzes policies from an alternating optimization algorithm.

Result: Theoretical conditions for stochastic and deterministic policies are derived and validated through numerical experiments.

Conclusion: The study successfully clarifies the temperature-policy relationship in MIOCP, providing theoretical and empirical support for the derived conditions.

Abstract: In recent years, mutual information optimal control has been proposed as an
extension of maximum entropy optimal control. Both approaches introduce
regularization terms to render the policy stochastic, and it is important to
theoretically clarify the relationship between the temperature parameter (i.e.,
the coefficient of the regularization term) and the stochasticity of the
policy. Unlike in maximum entropy optimal control, this relationship remains
unexplored in mutual information optimal control. In this paper, we investigate
this relationship for a mutual information optimal control problem (MIOCP) of
discrete-time linear systems. After extending the result of a previous study of
the MIOCP, we establish the existence of an optimal policy of the MIOCP, and
then derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which
the optimal policy becomes stochastic and deterministic. Furthermore, we also
derive the respective conditions on the temperature parameter under which the
policy obtained by an alternating optimization algorithm becomes stochastic and
deterministic. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated through
numerical experiments.

*Peihong Lin,Pengfei Wang,Xu Zhou,Wei Xie,Gen Zhang,Kai Lu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DeepGo is a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that combines historical and predicted path information to optimize reaching target sites efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DGF techniques rely on heuristic algorithms, which lack foresight for unexplored paths, hindering efficiency for complex constraints.

Method: DeepGo uses a path transition model, deep neural networks (VEE), and Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) to predict and optimize paths.

Result: The approach generates optimal path transition sequences and guides mutation strategies for efficient target reach.

Conclusion: DeepGo enhances DGF efficiency by integrating predictive modeling and reinforcement learning for path optimization.

Abstract: The state-of-the-art DGF techniques redefine and optimize the fitness metric
to reach the target sites precisely and quickly. However, optimizations for
fitness metrics are mainly based on heuristic algorithms, which usually rely on
historical execution information and lack foresight on paths that have not been
exercised yet. Thus, those hard-to-execute paths with complex constraints would
hinder DGF from reaching the targets, making DGF less efficient. In this paper,
we propose DeepGo, a predictive directed grey-box fuzzer that can combine
historical and predicted information to steer DGF to reach the target site via
an optimal path. We first propose the path transition model, which models DGF
as a process of reaching the target site through specific path transition
sequences. The new seed generated by mutation would cause the path transition,
and the path corresponding to the high-reward path transition sequence
indicates a high likelihood of reaching the target site through it. Then, to
predict the path transitions and the corresponding rewards, we use deep neural
networks to construct a Virtual Ensemble Environment (VEE), which gradually
imitates the path transition model and predicts the rewards of path transitions
that have not been taken yet. To determine the optimal path, we develop a
Reinforcement Learning for Fuzzing (RLF) model to generate the transition
sequences with the highest sequence rewards. The RLF model can combine
historical and predicted path transitions to generate the optimal path
transition sequences, along with the policy to guide the mutation strategy of
fuzzing. Finally, to exercise the high-reward path transition sequence, we
propose the concept of an action group, which comprehensively optimizes the
critical steps of fuzzing to realize the optimal path to reach the target
efficiently.

TL;DR: MAAD is a multi-agent framework for automated software architecture design, outperforming MetaGPT in generating comprehensive designs and evaluations, with GPT-4o showing superior performance among tested LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and labor-intensive nature of traditional software architecture design, coupled with the need for diverse domain knowledge and adaptability, motivates the exploration of LLM-based multi-agent systems for automation.

Method: MAAD employs a knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System with four specialized agents (Analyst, Modeler, Designer, Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements and produce architectural blueprints with evaluation reports.

Result: MAAD outperforms MetaGPT in generating architectural components and structured evaluations, with GPT-4o performing best among tested LLMs. Industrial feedback supports its practical usability.

Conclusion: MAAD demonstrates the potential of multi-agent systems and LLMs in automating architecture design, with GPT-4o being the most effective LLM for this task.

Abstract: Software architecture design is a critical, yet inherently complex and
knowledge-intensive phase of software development. It requires deep domain
expertise, development experience, architectural knowledge, careful trade-offs
among competing quality attributes, and the ability to adapt to evolving
requirements. Traditionally, this process is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, and relies heavily on architects, often resulting in limited
design alternatives, especially under the pressures of agile development. While
Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promising performance across
various SE tasks, their application to architecture design remains relatively
scarce and requires more exploration, particularly in light of diverse domain
knowledge and complex decision-making. To address the challenges, we proposed
MAAD (Multi-Agent Architecture Design), an automated framework that employs a
knowledge-driven Multi-Agent System (MAS) for architecture design. MAAD
orchestrates four specialized agents (i.e., Analyst, Modeler, Designer and
Evaluator) to collaboratively interpret requirements specifications and produce
architectural blueprints enriched with quality attributes-based evaluation
reports. We then evaluated MAAD through a case study and comparative
experiments against MetaGPT, a state-of-the-art MAS baseline. Our results show
that MAAD's superiority lies in generating comprehensive architectural
components and delivering insightful and structured architecture evaluation
reports. Feedback from industrial architects across 11 requirements
specifications further reinforces MAAD's practical usability. We finally
explored the performance of the MAAD framework with three LLMs (GPT-4o,
DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 3.3) and found that GPT-4o exhibits better performance
in producing architecture design, emphasizing the importance of LLM selection
in MAS-driven architecture design.

TL;DR: HLSDebugger, a customized solution using an encoder-decoder model, addresses challenges in HLS debugging by generating a large dataset and outperforming LLMs like GPT-4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Debugging HLS code is challenging, especially for novices, due to scarce training data, complex logic bugs, and lack of reliable test cases.

Method: HLSDebugger generates a 300K labeled dataset and uses an encoder-decoder model for bug identification, type prediction, and correction.

Result: HLSDebugger outperforms GPT-4 in bug identification and achieves over 3x better performance in bug correction.

Conclusion: HLSDebugger advances automated HLS debugging by effectively addressing key challenges.

Abstract: High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the
automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware
implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and
labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software
engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of
Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging
process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when
applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training
LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in
hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with
existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires
multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction.
complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this
work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the
challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset
with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts
an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type
prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly
outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x
in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of
automated debugging of HLS code.

Motivation: The rapid advancement of LLMs in code generation raises concerns about academic integrity and hiring fairness, necessitating robust detection systems.

Method: MultiAIGCD is created using CodeNet's problem definitions and human-authored codes, generating samples with six LLMs and three prompts across three usage scenarios.

Result: The dataset includes 121,271 AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. Three detection models are benchmarked, with performance assessed in cross-model and cross-language scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable dataset and benchmarks for AI-generated code detection, supporting further research in maintaining integrity and fairness.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, their role in code
generation has expanded significantly. While this offers streamlined
development, it also creates concerns in areas like education and job
interviews. Consequently, developing robust systems to detect AI-generated code
is imperative to maintain academic integrity and ensure fairness in hiring
processes. In this study, we introduce MultiAIGCD, a dataset for AI-generated
code detection for Python, Java, and Go. From the CodeNet dataset's problem
definitions and human-authored codes, we generate several code samples in Java,
Python, and Go with six different LLMs and three different prompts. This
generation process covered three key usage scenarios: (i) generating code from
problem descriptions, (ii) fixing runtime errors in human-written code, and
(iii) correcting incorrect outputs. Overall, MultiAIGCD consists of 121,271
AI-generated and 32,148 human-written code snippets. We also benchmark three
state-of-the-art AI-generated code detection models and assess their
performance in various test scenarios such as cross-model and cross-language.
We share our dataset and codes to support research in this field.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores 'vibe coding,' a new paradigm where humans and AI collaborate to create software through natural language, shifting intent mediation from deterministic to probabilistic. It highlights opportunities like democratization and risks like black box codebases, proposing a research agenda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of AI-generated code without deep conceptual understanding necessitates an inquiry into the emerging 'vibe coding' paradigm.

Method: The study uses an intent perspective and historical analysis to define vibe coding and examine its impact on cognitive work and expertise redistribution.

Result: Vibe coding redistributes epistemic labor, shifting expertise toward collaborative orchestration, with opportunities (e.g., democratization) and risks (e.g., responsibility gaps).

Conclusion: The paper proposes a research agenda to guide future investigations into human-, technology-, and organization-centered aspects of vibe coding.

Abstract: Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe
coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now
being AI-generated. The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited
conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging
paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define
vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and generative AI
engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural
language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from
deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we
refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their
conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute.
Our results show that vibe coding reconfigures cognitive work by redistributing
epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting the expertise in the
software development process away from traditional areas such as design or
technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key
opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage,
alongside risks, such as black box codebases, responsibility gaps, and
ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-,
technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future
investigations of this paradigm.

*Zengyang Li,Yimeng Li,Binbin Huang,Peng Liang,Ran Mo,Hui Liu,Yutao Ma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper explores using pre-trained code language models (CodeLMs) to detect cross-language bugs (CLBs) in multilingual programming, introducing CLCFinder and a CLB dataset. Fine-tuning improved performance, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual programming is common but introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs) that are hard to detect with single-language tools. This study investigates if CodeLMs can effectively detect CLBs.

Method: Developed CLCFinder, a cross-language code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset with three PL combinations and nine interaction types. Fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their performance.

Result: Fine-tuning improved CodeLMs' performance, with UniXcoder-base achieving the highest F1 score. Small models outperformed large ones, and single-language bug datasets were ineffective for CLB detection. Dataset size boosted performance, while token sequence length and code comments had mixed effects.

Conclusion: CodeLMs can detect CLBs effectively after fine-tuning, with smaller models often performing better. Dataset size is crucial, but token length and comments have variable impacts. CLBs are distinct from single-language bugs.

Abstract: Multilingual programming, which involves using multiple programming languages
(PLs) in a single project, is increasingly common due to its benefits. However,
it introduces cross-language bugs (CLBs), which arise from interactions between
different PLs and are difficult to detect by single-language bug detection
tools. This paper investigates the potential of pre-trained code language
models (CodeLMs) in CLB detection. We developed CLCFinder, a cross-language
code identification tool, and constructed a CLB dataset involving three PL
combinations (Python-C/C++, Java-C/C++, and Python-Java) with nine interaction
types. We fine-tuned 13 CodeLMs on this dataset and evaluated their
performance, analyzing the effects of dataset size, token sequence length, and
code comments. Results show that all CodeLMs performed poorly before
fine-tuning, but exhibited varying degrees of performance improvement after
fine-tuning, with UniXcoder-base achieving the best F1 score (0.7407). Notably,
small fine-tuned CodeLMs tended to performe better than large ones. CodeLMs
fine-tuned on single-language bug datasets performed poorly on CLB detection,
demonstrating the distinction between CLBs and single-language bugs.
Additionally, increasing the fine-tuning dataset size significantly improved
performance, while longer token sequences did not necessarily improve the model
performance. The impact of code comments varied across models. Some fine-tuned
CodeLMs' performance was improved, while others showed degraded performance.

TL;DR: SUnSET introduces a stakeholder-focused framework for timeline summarization, outperforming existing methods by leveraging LLMs and stakeholder-based ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing news summarization methods lack analysis of stakeholders and connections between events, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Uses LLMs to build SET (Stakeholder, Events, Time) triplets and introduces stakeholder-based ranking for a Relevancy metric.

Result: Outperforms prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results by incorporating stakeholder information.

Conclusion: SUnSET demonstrates the importance of stakeholder analysis in improving timeline summarization.

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online,
tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant
challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large
Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this
is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated
articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of
analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel
framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related
events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET:
Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of
Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to
construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations.
Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new
State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within

Result: DeepFDM achieves significantly lower errors, faster training, and fewer parameters compared to Fourier Neural Operators, U-Nets, and ResNets, with accurate coefficient recovery.

Conclusion: DeepFDM is a strong baseline for data-driven PDE solution and identification, offering transparency and efficiency.

Abstract: We present DeepFDM, a differentiable finite-difference framework for learning
spatially varying coefficients in time-dependent partial differential equations
(PDEs). By embedding a classical forward-Euler discretization into a
convolutional architecture, DeepFDM enforces stability and first-order
convergence via CFL-compliant coefficient parameterizations. Model weights
correspond directly to PDE coefficients, yielding an interpretable
inverse-problem formulation. We evaluate DeepFDM on a benchmark suite of scalar
PDEs: advection, diffusion, advection-diffusion, reaction-diffusion and
inhomogeneous Burgers' equations-in one, two and three spatial dimensions. In
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests (quantified by the Hellinger
distance between coefficient priors), DeepFDM attains normalized mean-squared
errors one to two orders of magnitude smaller than Fourier Neural Operators,
U-Nets and ResNets; requires 10-20X fewer training epochs; and uses 5-50X fewer
parameters. Moreover, recovered coefficient fields accurately match
ground-truth parameters. These results establish DeepFDM as a robust,
efficient, and transparent baseline for data-driven solution and identification
of parametric PDEs.

### [309] [Can large language models assist choice modelling? Insights into prompting strategies and current models capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21790)
*Georges Sfeir,Gabriel Nova,Stephane Hess,Sander van Cranenburgh*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper explores the use of LLMs in choice modelling, specifically for Multinomial Logit models, evaluating their performance across various configurations. Proprietary LLMs like Claude 4 Sonnet and GPT models showed promise, while open-weight models struggled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the untapped potential of LLMs in choice modelling, particularly for model specification and estimation, given their widespread use in other workflows.

Method: A systematic experimental framework tested 13 versions of 6 LLMs under 5 configurations, varying in modelling goal, prompting strategy, and information availability. Specifications were evaluated based on goodness-of-fit, plausibility, and complexity.

Result: Proprietary LLMs (e.g., Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT) performed well, especially with structured prompts. Open-weight models (e.g., Llama, Gemma) struggled. GPT-3 uniquely estimated its own specifications via self-generated code.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise in choice modelling but have limitations. Proprietary models outperform open-weight ones, and structured prompts enhance performance. Practical guidance is provided for integrating LLMs into workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support various workflows
across different disciplines, yet their potential in choice modelling remains
relatively unexplored. This work examines the potential of LLMs as assistive
agents in the specification and, where technically feasible, estimation of
Multinomial Logit models. We implement a systematic experimental framework
involving thirteen versions of six leading LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek,
Gemini, Gemma, and Llama) evaluated under five experimental configurations.
These configurations vary along three dimensions: modelling goal (suggesting
vs. suggesting and estimating MNLs); prompting strategy (Zero-Shot vs.
Chain-of-Thoughts); and information availability (full dataset vs. data
dictionary only). Each LLM-suggested specification is implemented, estimated,
and evaluated based on goodness-of-fit metrics, behavioural plausibility, and
model complexity. Findings reveal that proprietary LLMs can generate valid and
behaviourally sound utility specifications, particularly when guided by
structured prompts. Open-weight models such as Llama and Gemma struggled to
produce meaningful specifications. Claude 4 Sonnet consistently produced the
best-fitting and most complex models, while GPT models suggested models with
robust and stable modelling outcomes. Some LLMs performed better when provided
with just data dictionary, suggesting that limiting raw data access may enhance
internal reasoning capabilities. Among all LLMs, GPT o3 was uniquely capable of
correctly estimating its own specifications by executing self-generated code.
Overall, the results demonstrate both the promise and current limitations of
LLMs as assistive agents in choice modelling, not only for model specification
but also for supporting modelling decision and estimation, and provide
practical guidance for integrating these tools into choice modellers'
workflows.

TL;DR: GANs can learn stochastic dynamics, replacing traditional models for thermal fluctuations, with applications in particle systems and reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore GANs as a tool for learning stochastic dynamics and capturing thermal fluctuations, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional models.

Method: A conditional GAN is trained on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation data to propagate system states stochastically, with modifications for better convergence and accuracy.

Result: The GAN quantitatively reproduces equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with minor deviations from exact values.

Conclusion: GANs are effective for modeling stochastic dynamics, though extrapolation limits and future improvements are noted.

Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully
exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while
capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a
two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations
and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a
dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained
to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the
generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications
with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase
accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively
reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with
deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and
future perspectives are critically discussed.

TL;DR: The paper compares traditional and modern methods for outlier detection in longitudinal data, highlighting the flexibility and effectiveness of newer techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare traditional statistical methods with newer data mining and machine learning approaches for detecting outliers in longitudinal data.

Method: Applies and compares traditional outlier detection methods with distance-based and binary partitioning tree methods from data mining and machine learning on panel survey data.

Result: Traditional methods are simpler but require specific assumptions, while newer methods offer flexibility, effectiveness, and applicability to multidimensional data, though both require tuning parameters.

Conclusion: Recent methods are more adaptable and effective for outlier detection in longitudinal data, especially for multidimensional datasets, despite the need for parameter tuning.

Abstract: This note investigates the problem of detecting outliers in longitudinal
data. It compares well-known methods used in official statistics with proposals
from the fields of data mining and machine learning that are based on the
distance between observations or binary partitioning trees. This is achieved by
applying the methods to panel survey data related to different types of
statistical units. Traditional methods are quite simple, enabling the direct
identification of potential outliers, but they require specific assumptions. In
contrast, recent methods provide only a score whose magnitude is directly
related to the likelihood of an outlier being present. All the methods require
the user to set a number of tuning parameters. However, the most recent methods
are more flexible and sometimes more effective than traditional methods. In
addition, these methods can be applied to multidimensional data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the combolutional layer, a time-domain harmonic feature extractor, as an effective alternative to convolutional layers in audio tasks requiring precise harmonic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for appropriate inductive biases in machine learning models for audio, where short clips contain millions of samples, drives the development of the combolutional layer.

Method: The combolutional layer combines a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope detector to extract harmonic features in the time domain.

Result: The combolutional layer proves effective in tasks like piano transcription, speaker classification, and key detection, offering low parameter count, efficient CPU inference, real-valued computations, and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The combolutional layer is a viable replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks, providing computational efficiency and interpretability.

Abstract: Selecting appropriate inductive biases is an essential step in the design of
machine learning models, especially when working with audio, where even short
clips may contain millions of samples. To this end, we propose the
combolutional layer: a learned-delay IIR comb filter and fused envelope
detector, which extracts harmonic features in the time domain. We demonstrate
the efficacy of the combolutional layer on three information retrieval tasks,
evaluate its computational cost relative to other audio frontends, and provide
efficient implementations for training. We find that the combolutional layer is
an effective replacement for convolutional layers in audio tasks where precise
harmonic analysis is important, e.g., piano transcription, speaker
classification, and key detection. Additionally, the combolutional layer has
several other key benefits over existing frontends, namely: low parameter
count, efficient CPU inference, strictly real-valued computations, and improved
interpretability.

TL;DR: The Whilter model is a multitask solution for identifying undesirable samples in large-scale speech datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art classifiers with high F1 scores and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale speech datasets often contain undesirable features (e.g., multiple speakers, non-target languages, music) that can hinder model learning.

Method: Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to solve five diverse classification problems simultaneously.

Result: Whilter achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three subtasks, outperforming BEATs and reducing processing time.

Conclusion: Whilter is effective for filtering undesirable samples in speech datasets, offering high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Large-scale in-the-wild speech datasets have become more prevalent in recent
years due to increased interest in models that can learn useful features from
unlabelled data for tasks such as speech recognition or synthesis. These
datasets often contain undesirable features, such as multiple speakers,
non-target languages, and music, which may impact model learning. The Whilter
model is proposed as a multitask solution to identify these undesirable
samples. Whilter uses a Whisper encoder with an attention-based classifier to
solve five diverse classification problems at once. In addition, an annotated
dataset is published for a subset of two popular in-the-wild corpora. Whilter
achieves F1 scores above 85% and equal error rates of 6.5% to 7.8% for three of
five subtasks, outperforming a state-of-the-art BEATs classifier on
speech-specific classes, with a notable decrease in processing time compared to

TL;DR: Sync-TVA is a graph-attention framework for multimodal emotion recognition, improving cross-modal interaction and balance with dynamic enhancement and structured fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER methods lack effective cross-modal interaction and balanced modality contributions, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes Sync-TVA with modality-specific dynamic enhancement, heterogeneous cross-modal graphs, and cross-attention fusion for robust emotion inference.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on MELD and IEMOCAP in accuracy and weighted F1 score, especially in class-imbalanced scenarios.

Conclusion: Sync-TVA effectively addresses cross-modal interaction and imbalance, enhancing MER performance.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is crucial for enabling emotionally
intelligent systems that perceive and respond to human emotions. However,
existing methods suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and imbalanced
contributions across modalities. To address these issues, we propose Sync-TVA,
an end-to-end graph-attention framework featuring modality-specific dynamic
enhancement and structured cross-modal fusion. Our design incorporates a
dynamic enhancement module for each modality and constructs heterogeneous
cross-modal graphs to model semantic relations across text, audio, and visual
features. A cross-attention fusion mechanism further aligns multimodal cues for
robust emotion inference. Experiments on MELD and IEMOCAP demonstrate
consistent improvements over state-of-the-art models in both accuracy and
weighted F1 score, especially under class-imbalanced conditions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A framework called Mass-Spring Net is proposed to efficiently simulate complex clothing materials using motion observations, avoiding computational and numerical issues of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real clothing materials are complex and spatially varied, making traditional simulation methods computationally expensive and prone to artifacts like membrane locking.

Method: Discretizes cloth into a mass-spring network with learned parameters from motion data, using a novel force-and-impulse loss function.

Result: Accurately models spatially varying materials, avoids membrane locking, and outperforms graph-based and neural ODE methods in speed, accuracy, and generalization.

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net offers a simpler, faster, and more accurate alternative to traditional simulation methods for complex clothing materials.

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

TL;DR: RAVEN is a real-time audio-visual speech enhancement system that isolates and enhances the target speaker while suppressing noise and interfering speakers, leveraging visual embeddings from AVSR and ASD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings is challenging, especially with interfering speakers, prompting the need for an effective real-time AVSE system.

Method: RAVEN uses visual embeddings from AVSR and ASD models, concatenating them for multi-speaker environments and using AVSR alone for noise-only scenarios. A real-time streaming system is also developed.

Result: Concatenated AVSR and ASD embeddings improve performance in low-SNR, multi-speaker settings, while AVSR alone excels in noise-only conditions.

Conclusion: RAVEN is the first open-source real-time AVSE system, demonstrating effectiveness in diverse noise and speaker scenarios.

Abstract: Speech enhancement in audio-only settings remains challenging, particularly
in the presence of interfering speakers. This paper presents a simple yet
effective real-time audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) system, RAVEN, which
isolates and enhances the on-screen target speaker while suppressing
interfering speakers and background noise. We investigate how visual embeddings
learned from audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) and active speaker
detection (ASD) contribute to AVSE across different SNR conditions and numbers
of interfering speakers. Our results show concatenating embeddings from AVSR
and ASD models provides the greatest improvement in low-SNR, multi-speaker
environments, while AVSR embeddings alone perform best in noise-only scenarios.
In addition, we develop a real-time streaming system that operates on a
computer CPU and we provide a video demonstration and code repository. To our
knowledge, this is the first open-source implementation of a real-time AVSE
system.

TL;DR: A generalized Kuramoto model with higher-order coupling (quartic) enables dense associative memory, showing robust storage and superlinear memory capacity scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge Kuramoto synchronization with Hopfield memories, enabling high-capacity analog associative memory in oscillator systems.

Method: Introduces a Kuramoto model with second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling, analyzed via mean-field theory and simulations.

Result: Exhibits a tricritical point, bistable memory states, and superlinear memory capacity scaling, confirmed by large-scale simulations.

Conclusion: Higher-order coupling in oscillator networks achieves robust, high-capacity associative memory, advancing experimental realization.

Abstract: Networks of phase oscillators can serve as dense associative memories if they
incorporate higher-order coupling beyond the classical Kuramoto model's
pairwise interactions. Here we introduce a generalized Kuramoto model with
combined second-harmonic (pairwise) and fourth-harmonic (quartic) coupling,
inspired by dense Hopfield memory theory. Using mean-field theory and its
dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory
model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory
retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the
quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states
corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between
memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region
and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows
exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the
theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve
superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the
limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator
network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern
retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns. These results bridge the
Kuramoto synchronization with modern Hopfield memories, pointing toward
experimental realization of high-capacity, analog associative memory in
oscillator systems.

Conclusion: OneShield offers a flexible, customer-focused approach to safeguarding LLMs against potential risks.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the
great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many

all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures
for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature

customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities
for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and
compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific
customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability
considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first

Motivation: Addressing patient privacy concerns in AI-driven medical diagnostics when handling sensitive imaging data.

Method: Proposes a Masked-CNN for encrypted inference, combining AES-CBC encryption and JPEG2000 compression to protect data while enabling AI analysis.

Result: The encrypted model performs similarly to unencrypted models, with minor accuracy and latency trade-offs, tested on NIH ChestX-ray14 and LIDC-IDRI datasets.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances privacy and clinical utility, providing a scalable solution for secure AI diagnostics.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into medical
diagnostics has raised pressing concerns about patient privacy, especially when
sensitive imaging data must be transferred, stored, or processed. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for privacy-preserving diagnostic inference
on encrypted medical images using a modified convolutional neural network
(Masked-CNN) capable of operating on transformed or ciphered image formats. Our
approach leverages AES-CBC encryption coupled with JPEG2000 compression to
protect medical images while maintaining their suitability for AI inference. We
evaluate the system using public DICOM datasets (NIH ChestX-ray14 and
LIDC-IDRI), focusing on diagnostic accuracy, inference latency, storage
efficiency, and privacy leakage resistance. Experimental results show that the
encrypted inference model achieves performance comparable to its unencrypted
counterpart, with only marginal trade-offs in accuracy and latency. The
proposed framework bridges the gap between data privacy and clinical utility,
offering a practical, scalable solution for secure AI-driven diagnostics.

TL;DR: A novel black-box adversarial attack method for 3D point cloud classification using a diffusion model improves attack success and imperceptibility without needing model internals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks on 3D point cloud models are mostly white-box, limiting real-world applicability. Black-box attacks often perform poorly, posing safety risks in critical applications like autonomous vehicles.

Method: The proposed method uses a 3D diffusion model to leverage compressed point cloud features as prior knowledge, guiding adversarial point addition via reverse diffusion.

Result: The approach enhances attack success and imperceptibility in black-box settings without accessing model internals.

Conclusion: The method addresses limitations of existing black-box attacks, offering a more practical solution for real-world adversarial evaluation of 3D point cloud models.

Abstract: Adversarial attack methods for 3D point cloud classification reveal the
vulnerabilities of point cloud recognition models. This vulnerability could
lead to safety risks in critical applications that use deep learning models,
such as autonomous vehicles. To uncover the deficiencies of these models,
researchers can evaluate their security through adversarial attacks. However,
most existing adversarial attack methods are based on white-box attacks. While
these methods achieve high attack success rates and imperceptibility, their
applicability in real-world scenarios is limited. Black-box attacks, which are
more meaningful in real-world scenarios, often yield poor results. This paper
proposes a novel black-box adversarial example generation method that utilizes
a diffusion model to improve the attack success rate and imperceptibility in
the black-box setting, without relying on the internal information of the point
cloud classification model to generate adversarial samples. We use a 3D
diffusion model to use the compressed features of the point cloud as prior
knowledge to guide the reverse diffusion process to add adversarial points to
clean examples. Subsequently, its reverse process is employed to transform the
distribution of other categories into adversarial points, which are then added
to the point cloud.

TL;DR: FedBAP is a defense framework for FL that reduces model reliance on backdoor triggers using perturbed triggers and adaptive scaling, achieving significant attack success rate reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL defenses are ineffective against backdoor attacks due to model over-reliance on triggers, especially with increasing malicious clients.

Method: FedBAP introduces perturbed trigger generation, benign adversarial perturbations, and adaptive scaling to disrupt backdoor reliance.

Result: FedBAP reduces attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three backdoor attack types.

Conclusion: FedBAP effectively mitigates backdoor attacks in FL, especially against novel attacks, while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving
data privacy, but it is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most existing
defense methods in FL have limited effectiveness due to their neglect of the
model's over-reliance on backdoor triggers, particularly as the proportion of
malicious clients increases. In this paper, we propose FedBAP, a novel defense
framework for mitigating backdoor attacks in FL by reducing the model's
reliance on backdoor triggers. Specifically, first, we propose a perturbed
trigger generation mechanism that creates perturbation triggers precisely
matching backdoor triggers in location and size, ensuring strong influence on
model outputs. Second, we utilize these perturbation triggers to generate
benign adversarial perturbations that disrupt the model's dependence on
backdoor triggers while forcing it to learn more robust decision boundaries.
Finally, we design an adaptive scaling mechanism to dynamically adjust
perturbation intensity, effectively balancing defense strength and model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate that FedBAP reduces the
attack success rates by 0.22%-5.34%, 0.48%-6.34%, and 97.22%-97.6% under three
types of backdoor attacks, respectively. In particular, FedBAP demonstrates
outstanding performance against novel backdoor attacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance security in RANs using LLMs for explainable intrusion detection, addressing challenges and gaps in 5G/6G infrastructures.

Method: LSTM model trained on KPMs from E2 nodes, with post-hoc explainability (LIME, SHAP) and LLMs for natural-language insights.

Result: High detection accuracy (F1-score > 0.96) with actionable, interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: Proposed framework effectively combines LLMs and XAI for secure, transparent RAN environments.

Abstract: Next generation Radio Access Networks (RANs) introduce programmability,
intelligence, and near real-time control through intelligent controllers,
enabling enhanced security within the RAN and across broader 5G/6G
infrastructures. This paper presents a comprehensive survey highlighting
opportunities, challenges, and research gaps for Large Language Models
(LLMs)-assisted explainable (XAI) intrusion detection (IDS) for secure future
RAN environments. Motivated by this, we propose an LLM interpretable
anomaly-based detection system for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
using multivariate time series key performance measures (KPMs), extracted from
E2 nodes, within the Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC).
An LSTM-based model is trained to identify malicious User Equipment (UE)
behavior based on these KPMs. To enhance transparency, we apply post-hoc local
explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP to interpret individual
predictions. Furthermore, LLMs are employed to convert technical explanations
into natural-language insights accessible to non-expert users. Experimental

*Zhicheng Zhang,Peizhuo Lv,Mengke Wan,Jiang Fang,Diandian Guo,Yezeng Chen,Yinlong Liu,Wei Ma,Jiyan Sun,Liru Geng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Proposes Hot-Swap MarkBoard, a watermarking method for on-device AI models to protect IP by embedding unique, customizable watermarks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses IP risks in on-device AI deployment, where existing watermarking methods (e.g., fixed watermarks) are inefficient for large-scale distribution.

Method: Uses multi-branch LoRA modules to embed user-specific binary signatures, enabling watermark customization via branch swapping. Includes parameter obfuscation to prevent removal.

Result: Achieves 100% verification accuracy across diverse tasks and models, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard is efficient, adaptable, and effective for protecting on-device AI models.

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

*Naseem Khan,Tuan Nguyen,Amine Bermak,Issa Khalil*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A systematic review of deepfake detection methods highlights two paradigms: detecting fully synthetic media and localizing manipulated regions. While effective in controlled settings, these methods lack adversarial robustness, necessitating future work on resilient architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of deepfakes poses threats to digital security and misinformation, requiring transparent and validated detection methods.

Method: The review evaluates two detection paradigms: (1) identifying synthetic media via statistical anomalies and feature extraction, and (2) localizing manipulations using multi-modal cues like visual artifacts.

Result: Current methods show precision in controlled settings but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, revealing a gap in real-world reliability.

Conclusion: Future research must focus on adversarial resilience and scalable architectures to address evolving threats, supported by an open-source repository for replication.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled
deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of
withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and
shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward
robust trustworthy systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper refutes the 'blockchain trilemma' by showing it lacks formal grounding, using formal analysis and empirical evidence to highlight flaws in methodology and terminology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the widely accepted but unproven 'blockchain trilemma' and address misconceptions in blockchain research.

Method: Formal analysis, empirical evidence, critique of methodology and terminology, and reconstruction of Bitcoin's design.

Result: Demonstrates that the trilemma is based on flawed assumptions and that scalability is an engineering outcome, not a trade-off.

Conclusion: Identifies systemic issues in academic discourse and proposes formal criteria for future blockchain research.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refutation of the so-called "blockchain
trilemma," a widely cited but formally ungrounded claim asserting an inherent
trade-off between decentralisation, security, and scalability in blockchain
protocols. Through formal analysis, empirical evidence, and detailed critique
of both methodology and terminology, we demonstrate that the trilemma rests on
semantic equivocation, misuse of distributed systems theory, and a failure to
define operational metrics. Particular focus is placed on the conflation of
topological network analogies with protocol-level architecture, the
mischaracterisation of Bitcoin's design--including the role of miners, SPV
clients, and header-based verification--and the failure to ground claims in
complexity-theoretic or adversarial models. By reconstructing Bitcoin as a
deterministic, stateless distribution protocol governed by evidentiary trust,
we show that scalability is not a trade-off but an engineering outcome. The
paper concludes by identifying systemic issues in academic discourse and peer
review that have allowed such fallacies to persist, and offers formal criteria
for evaluating future claims in blockchain research.

*Quanchen Zou,Zonghao Ying,Moyang Chen,Wenzhuo Xu,Yisong Xiao,Yakai Li,Deyue Zhang,Dongdong Yang,Zhao Liu,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A novel jailbreak framework for LVLMs uses benign visual gadgets and textual prompts to exploit compositional reasoning, achieving high attack success rates and revealing critical vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety defenses in LVLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially those exploiting subtle reasoning steps.

Method: Proposes a jailbreak framework inspired by ROP, decomposing harmful instructions into benign visual gadgets guided by textual prompts.

Result: Achieves near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90 on SafeBench) and improves ASR by up to 0.39.

Conclusion: Highlights a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' compositional reasoning, urging defenses for the entire reasoning process.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent
harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on
direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in
how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a
harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A
carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting
the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process
to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent
emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our
method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including
SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our
approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on
state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90
on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical
and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning
abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the
entire reasoning process.

*Yuntao Du,Jiacheng Li,Yuetian Chen,Kaiyuan Zhang,Zhizhen Yuan,Hanshen Xiao,Bruno Ribeiro,Ninghui Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces two Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs): CMIA for adaptive settings and PMIA for non-adaptive settings, both outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the effectiveness of MIAs by addressing membership dependencies and proxy behaviors in different adversarial settings.

Method: CMIA uses conditional shadow training for adaptive settings, while PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy for non-adaptive settings.

Result: Both CMIA and PMIA significantly outperform existing MIAs, especially in low false-positive regimes.

Conclusion: The proposed attacks enhance privacy risk evaluation by improving membership inference performance.

Abstract: A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) assesses how much a trained machine
learning model reveals about its training data by determining whether specific
query instances were included in the dataset. We classify existing MIAs into
adaptive or non-adaptive, depending on whether the adversary is allowed to
train shadow models on membership queries. In the adaptive setting, where the
adversary can train shadow models after accessing query instances, we highlight
the importance of exploiting membership dependencies between instances and
propose an attack-agnostic framework called Cascading Membership Inference
Attack (CMIA), which incorporates membership dependencies via conditional
shadow training to boost membership inference performance.
  In the non-adaptive setting, where the adversary is restricted to training
shadow models before obtaining membership queries, we introduce Proxy
Membership Inference Attack (PMIA). PMIA employs a proxy selection strategy
that identifies samples with similar behaviors to the query instance and uses
their behaviors in shadow models to perform a membership posterior odds test
for membership inference. We provide theoretical analyses for both attacks, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate that CMIA and PMIA substantially
outperform existing MIAs in both settings, particularly in the low
false-positive regime, which is crucial for evaluating privacy risks.

*Chenhao Fang,Yanqing Peng,Rajeev Rao,Matt Sarmiento,Wendy Summer,Arya Pudota,Alex Goncalves,Jordi Mola,Hervé Robert*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PACT is an embeddings-driven graph system that links diverse enterprise artifacts to improve privacy compliance, achieving significant performance improvements in recall and query matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprise environments lack a unified system to assess privacy risk across heterogeneous artifacts, making compliance challenging.

Method: PACT uses the DRAGON embedding model with contrastive learning and fine-tuning to link artifacts via textual components like metadata and compliance context.

Result: PACT improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, query match rate from 9.6% to 69.7%, and hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9%.

Conclusion: PACT effectively addresses privacy compliance by linking diverse artifacts, demonstrating significant performance gains.

Abstract: Enterprise environments contain a heterogeneous, rapidly growing collection
of internal artifacts related to code, data, and many different tools. Critical
information for assessing privacy risk and ensuring regulatory compliance is
often embedded across these varied resources, each with their own arcane
discovery and extraction techniques. Therefore, large-scale privacy compliance
in adherence to governmental regulations requires systems to discern the
interconnected nature of diverse artifacts in a common, shared universe.
  We present Privacy Artifact ConnecT or (PACT), an embeddings-driven graph
that links millions of artifacts spanning multiple artifact types generated by
a variety of teams and projects. Powered by the state-of-the-art DRAGON
embedding model, PACT uses a contrastive learning objective with light
fine-tuning to link artifacts via their textual components such as raw
metadata, ownership specifics, and compliance context. Experimental results
show that PACT's fine-tuned model improves recall@1 from 18% to 53%, the query
match rate from 9.6% to 69.7% when paired with a baseline AI agent, and the
hitrate@1 from 25.7% to 44.9% for candidate selection in a standard recommender
system.

### [331] [Towards Unifying Quantitative Security Benchmarking for Multi Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21146)
*Gauri Sharma,Vidhi Kulkarni,Miles King,Ken Huang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Agent Cascading Injection (ACI), a security risk in multi-agent AI systems where a breach in one agent cascades through the network, exploiting inter-agent trust. It formalizes ACI, analyzes its properties, and proposes a benchmarking framework for evaluating system resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of multi-agent AI systems introduces novel security risks, particularly cascading breaches due to inter-agent trust. This work aims to formalize and address these risks.

Method: The paper defines ACI, formalizes it with an adversarial goal equation, and analyzes its properties (propagation chains, amplification factors). It also outlines a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems.

Result: ACI is mapped to OWASP's Agentic AI risk categories, and a framework for benchmarking system resilience against cascading trust failures is proposed.

Conclusion: The work provides tools for engineers to evaluate and improve the security of multi-agent systems, addressing emerging agentic threats.

Abstract: Evolving AI systems increasingly deploy multi-agent architectures where
autonomous agents collaborate, share information, and delegate tasks through
developing protocols. This connectivity, while powerful, introduces novel
security risks. One such risk is a cascading risk: a breach in one agent can
cascade through the system, compromising others by exploiting inter-agent
trust. In tandem with OWASP's initiative for an Agentic AI Vulnerability
Scoring System we define an attack vector, Agent Cascading Injection, analogous
to Agent Impact Chain and Blast Radius, operating across networks of agents. In
an ACI attack, a malicious input or tool exploit injected at one agent leads to
cascading compromises and amplified downstream effects across agents that trust
its outputs. We formalize this attack with an adversarial goal equation and key
variables (compromised agent, injected exploit, polluted observations, etc.),
capturing how a localized vulnerability can escalate into system-wide failure.
We then analyze ACI's properties -- propagation chains, amplification factors,
and inter-agent compound effects -- and map these to OWASP's emerging Agentic
AI risk categories (e.g. Impact Chain and Orchestration Exploits). Finally, we
argue that ACI highlights a critical need for quantitative benchmarking
frameworks to evaluate the security of agent-to-agent communication protocols.
We outline a methodology for stress-testing multi-agent systems (using
architectures such as Google's A2A and Anthropic's MCP) against cascading trust
failures, developing upon groundwork for measurable, standardized
agent-to-agent security evaluation. Our work provides the necessary apparatus
for engineers to benchmark system resilience, make data-driven architectural
trade-offs, and develop robust defenses against a new generation of agentic
threats.

*Zixuan Chen,Weikai Lu,Xin Lin,Ziqian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework to counter malicious fine-tuning of open-source LLMs, ensuring they produce irrelevant responses to harmful prompts and degrade general capability under attack.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malicious fine-tuning can bypass safety alignment in LLMs, necessitating a defense mechanism to prevent harmful instruction-following.

Method: Theoretical analysis of why malicious fine-tuning works, followed by the introduction of SDD, which degrades LLM capability when fine-tuned on harmful data.

Result: SDD effectively prevents LLMs from following harmful instructions by degrading their general performance under malicious fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SDD provides a robust defense against malicious fine-tuning, ensuring LLMs remain safe even when attacked.

Abstract: Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) often employ safety alignment
methods to resist harmful instructions. However, recent research shows that
maliciously fine-tuning these LLMs on harmful data can easily bypass these
safeguards. To counter this, we theoretically uncover why malicious fine-tuning
succeeds and identify potential defense strategies. Building on the theoretical
analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD
encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful
prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability
of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable
of following harmful instructions. Our experimental results confirm SDD's
effectiveness against such attacks.

*Po-Yuan Mao,Cheng-Chang Tsai,Chun-Shien Lu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MaXsive is a training-free diffusion watermarking technique with high capacity and robustness against RST attacks, using an X-shape template for distortion recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing copyright and content issues in diffusion models by improving watermarking robustness and capacity.

Method: Utilizes initial noise for watermarking and injects an X-shape template to recover from RST distortions.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on watermarking benchmarks for verification and identification.

Conclusion: MaXsive offers a robust, high-capacity solution for diffusion model watermarking, reducing ID collusion risks.

Abstract: The great success of the diffusion model in image synthesis led to the
release of gigantic commercial models, raising the issue of copyright
protection and inappropriate content generation. Training-free diffusion
watermarking provides a low-cost solution for these issues. However, the prior
works remain vulnerable to rotation, scaling, and translation (RST) attacks.
Although some methods employ meticulously designed patterns to mitigate this
issue, they often reduce watermark capacity, which can result in identity (ID)
collusion. To address these problems, we propose MaXsive, a training-free
diffusion model generative watermarking technique that has high capacity and
robustness. MaXsive best utilizes the initial noise to watermark the diffusion
model. Moreover, instead of using a meticulously repetitive ring pattern, we
propose injecting the X-shape template to recover the RST distortions. This
design significantly increases robustness without losing any capacity, making
ID collusion less likely to happen. The effectiveness of MaXsive has been
verified on two well-known watermarking benchmarks under the scenarios of
verification and identification.

### [334] [NCCR: to Evaluate the Robustness of Neural Networks and Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21483)
*Pu Shi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces NCCR, a metric to evaluate neural network robustness and detect adversarial examples by measuring neuron output changes under input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing research lacks robust evaluation methods for their stability and resistance.

Method: Proposes the Neuron Cover Change Rate (NCCR) metric, which tracks output changes in selected neurons when inputs are perturbed.

Result: Experiments on image and speaker recognition models show NCCR effectively assesses robustness and detects adversarial examples.

Conclusion: NCCR is a reliable metric for evaluating neural network robustness and identifying adversarial inputs.

Abstract: Neural networks have received a lot of attention recently, and related
security issues have come with it. Many studies have shown that neural networks
are vulnerable to adversarial examples that have been artificially perturbed
with modification, which is too small to be distinguishable by human
perception. Different attacks and defenses have been proposed to solve these
problems, but there is little research on evaluating the robustness of neural
networks and their inputs. In this work, we propose a metric called the neuron
cover change rate (NCCR) to measure the ability of deep learning models to
resist attacks and the stability of adversarial examples. NCCR monitors
alterations in the output of specifically chosen neurons when the input is
perturbed, and networks with a smaller degree of variation are considered to be
more robust. The results of the experiment on image recognition and the speaker
recognition model show that our metrics can provide a good assessment of the
robustness of neural networks or their inputs. It can also be used to detect
whether an input is adversarial or not, as adversarial examples are always less
robust.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Graph Neural Network (GNN), specifically GraphSAGE, for steganalysis of compressed VoIP speech streams, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based steganalysis methods face computational complexity and generalization issues, prompting the use of GNNs for improved accuracy and adaptability.

Method: The method constructs graphs from VoIP streams and uses GraphSAGE to capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including fine-grained details and high-level patterns.

Result: The approach achieves over 98% accuracy for 0.5-second samples and 95.17% for low embedding rates, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2.8%. It also reduces detection time to 0.016 seconds.

Conclusion: The GNN-based method offers superior accuracy and efficiency for online steganalysis, especially for short samples with low embedding rates.

Abstract: Steganalysis methods based on deep learning (DL) often struggle with
computational complexity and challenges in generalizing across different
datasets. Incorporating a graph neural network (GNN) into steganalysis schemes
enables the leveraging of relational data for improved detection accuracy and
adaptability. This paper presents the first application of a Graph Neural
Network (GNN), specifically the GraphSAGE architecture, for steganalysis of
compressed voice over IP (VoIP) speech streams. The method involves
straightforward graph construction from VoIP streams and employs GraphSAGE to
capture hierarchical steganalysis information, including both fine grained
details and high level patterns, thereby achieving high detection accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach performs well in
uncovering quantization index modulation (QIM)-based steganographic patterns in
VoIP signals. It achieves detection accuracy exceeding 98 percent even for
short 0.5 second samples, and 95.17 percent accuracy under challenging
conditions with low embedding rates, representing an improvement of 2.8 percent
over the best performing state of the art methods. Furthermore, the model
exhibits superior efficiency, with an average detection time as low as 0.016
seconds for 0.5-second samples an improvement of 0.003 seconds. This makes it
efficient for online steganalysis tasks, providing a superior balance between
detection accuracy and efficiency under the constraint of short samples with
low embedding rates.

*Hyeong Seon Kim,Huy Kang Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GUARD-CAN is an anomaly detection framework for CAN networks, combining graph-based learning and time-series modeling to detect attacks like flooding, fuzzing, replay, and spoofing without complex feature engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the security vulnerabilities in CAN networks due to lack of encryption and authentication.

Method: Uses graph-based representation learning (GCN) and time-series modeling (GRU) with an overcomplete Autoencoder to detect anomalies in CAN messages.

Result: Effectively detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding, fuzzing, replay, spoofing) without complex feature engineering.

Conclusion: GUARD-CAN provides a robust, multi-perspective approach to CAN network security, validated by performance evaluation and entropy analysis.

Abstract: Modern in-vehicle networks face various cyber threats due to the lack of
encryption and authentication in the Controller Area Network (CAN). To address
this security issue, this paper presents GUARD-CAN, an anomaly detection
framework that combines graph-based representation learning with time-series
modeling. GUARD-CAN splits CAN messages into fixed-length windows and converts
each window into a graph that preserves message order. To detect anomalies in
the timeaware and structure-aware context at the same window, GUARD-CAN takes
advantage of the overcomplete Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) to generate graph embedding vectors. The model groups these vectors into
sequences and feeds them into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect temporal
anomaly patterns across the graphs. GUARD-CAN performs anomaly detection at
both the sequence level and the window level, and this allows multi-perspective
performance evaluation. The model also verifies the importance of window size
selection through an analysis based on Shannon entropy. As a result, GUARD-CAN
shows that the proposed model detects four types of CAN attacks (flooding,
fuzzing, replay and spoofing attacks) effectively without relying on complex
feature engineering.

*Muzhi Dai,Shixuan Liu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Hao Sun,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SecTOW is an iterative defense-attack training method using reinforcement learning to enhance MLLM security by balancing defense and attack modules, improving robustness without over-refusing harmless inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the sparsity of unsafe image-query pairs and intrinsic vulnerabilities in MLLMs, as existing methods either lack diversity or over-refuse harmless inputs.

Method: SecTOW employs a defender and auxiliary attacker trained iteratively with GRPO, using reward mechanisms and quality monitoring to refine security and data diversity.

Result: SecTOW significantly improves security on safety-specific and general benchmarks while maintaining general performance.

Conclusion: SecTOW offers a robust solution to MLLM security challenges by iteratively refining defense and attack strategies, ensuring balanced performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to
breakthroughs in various applications, yet their security remains a critical
challenge. One pressing issue involves unsafe image-query pairs--jailbreak
inputs specifically designed to bypass security constraints and elicit
unintended responses from MLLMs. Compared to general multimodal data, such
unsafe inputs are relatively sparse, which limits the diversity and richness of
training samples available for developing robust defense models. Meanwhile,
existing guardrail-type methods rely on external modules to enforce security
constraints but fail to address intrinsic vulnerabilities within MLLMs.
Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), on the other hand, often over-refuses
harmless inputs, compromising general performance. Given these challenges, we
propose Secure Tug-of-War (SecTOW), an innovative iterative defense-attack
training method to enhance the security of MLLMs. SecTOW consists of two
modules: a defender and an auxiliary attacker, both trained iteratively using
reinforcement learning (GRPO). During the iterative process, the attacker
identifies security vulnerabilities in the defense model and expands jailbreak
data. The expanded data are then used to train the defender, enabling it to
address identified security vulnerabilities. We also design reward mechanisms
used for GRPO to simplify the use of response labels, reducing dependence on
complex generative labels and enabling the efficient use of synthetic data.
Additionally, a quality monitoring mechanism is used to mitigate the defender's
over-refusal of harmless inputs and ensure the diversity of the jailbreak data
generated by the attacker. Experimental results on safety-specific and general
benchmarks demonstrate that SecTOW significantly improves security while
preserving general performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize the behavior of cardinal semantic operators and their interactions within a semantic numeration system.

Method: Proposes CAOs as linear discrete dynamical systems with nonlinear control, deriving state equations for stationary and non-stationary cases under ideal observability.

Result: Demonstrates the importance of the configuration matrix in defining the types, parameters, and connectivity of cardinal semantic operators within CAOs.

Conclusion: The framework provides a structured approach to modeling semantic numeration systems, emphasizing the role of the configuration matrix.

Abstract: The foundational concepts of semantic numeration systems theory are briefly
outlined. The action of cardinal semantic operators unfolds over a set of
cardinal abstract entities belonging to the cardinal semantic multeity. The
cardinal abstract object (CAO) formed by them in a certain connectivity
topology is proposed to be considered as a linear discrete dynamical system
with nonlinear control. Under the assumption of ideal observability, the CAO
state equations are provided for both stationary and non-stationary cases. The
fundamental role of the configuration matrix, which combines information about
the types of cardinal semantic operators in the CAO, their parameters and
topology of connectivity, is demonstrated.

Method: Evaluated four models (ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-Base, DeiT-Small) on three medical imaging tasks using 8,469 images.

Result: ResNet-50 excelled in chest X-ray classification (98.37%), DeiT-Small in brain tumor detection (92.16%), and EfficientNet-B0 in skin cancer classification (81.84%).

Conclusion: Task-specific architecture selection is crucial for medical AI applications, as no single model outperforms others across all tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has revolutionized computer
vision, yet their effectiveness compared to traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) in medical imaging remains under-explored. This study presents
a comprehensive comparative analysis of CNN and ViT architectures across three
critical medical imaging tasks: chest X-ray pneumonia detection, brain tumor
classification, and skin cancer melanoma detection. We evaluated four
state-of-the-art models - ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, ViT-Base, and DeiT-Small
- across datasets totaling 8,469 medical images. Our results demonstrate
task-specific model advantages: ResNet-50 achieved 98.37% accuracy on chest
X-ray classification, DeiT-Small excelled at brain tumor detection with 92.16%
accuracy, and EfficientNet-B0 led skin cancer classification at 81.84%
accuracy. These findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting
architectures for medical AI applications, highlighting the importance of
task-specific architecture selection in clinical decision support systems.

*Gaurav Parajuli*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores adapting the Florence2 model for medical VQA tasks, specifically for GI endoscopy images, to improve diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs perform poorly in specialized domains like medical imaging, despite their potential for aiding clinical diagnoses.

Method: The study adapts the Florence2 model for medical VQA tasks and evaluates it on GI endoscopy images using metrics like ROUGE, BLEU, and METEOR.

Result: The performance of the adapted Florence2 model is assessed, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The adaptation of Florence2 for medical VQA shows promise for improving diagnostic AI systems in specialized domains like GI disease.

Abstract: VQA (Visual Question Answering) combines Natural Language Processing (NLP)
with image understanding to answer questions about a given image. It has
enormous potential for the development of medical diagnostic AI systems. Such a
system can help clinicians diagnose gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases accurately
and efficiently. Although many of the multimodal LLMs available today have
excellent VQA capabilities in the general domain, they perform very poorly for
VQA tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging. This study is a
submission for ImageCLEFmed-MEDVQA-GI 2025 subtask 1 that explores the
adaptation of the Florence2 model to answer medical visual questions on GI
endoscopy images. We also evaluate the model performance using standard metrics
like ROUGE, BLEU and METEOR

### [341] [ST-DAI: Single-shot 2.5D Spatial Transcriptomics with Intra-Sample Domain Adaptive Imputation for Cost-efficient 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21516)
*Jiahe Qian,Yaoyu Fang,Xinkun Wang,Lee A. Cooper,Bo Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ST-DAI is a cost-efficient 3D spatial transcriptomics framework using 2.5D sampling and intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation to reduce experimental costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs and domain discrepancies in fully sampling 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST) motivate the need for a cost-efficient and generalizable solution.

Method: ST-DAI combines 2.5D sampling (fully sampling a central section and sparsely sampling adjacent sections) with intra-sample domain-adaptive imputation, including alignment, pseudo-supervision, and Fast Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR) with Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs).

Result: ST-DAI achieves gene expression prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while significantly reducing measurement burden.

Conclusion: ST-DAI offers a practical and cost-effective solution for 3D ST by leveraging intra-sample learning and domain adaptation.

Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of
fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although
recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods
require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from
substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new
samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST
that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample
domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D
sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while
other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing
volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we
propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate
fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only
sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain
discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that
first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates
dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast
Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the
adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of
Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a
Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their
estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.
Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression
prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while
substantially reducing the measurement burden.

### [342] [VidFuncta: Towards Generalizable Neural Representations for Ultrasound Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21863)
*Julia Wolleb,Florentin Bieder,Paul Friedrich,Hemant D. Tagare,Xenophon Papademetris*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: VidFuncta, an extension of Functa, uses implicit neural representations to encode ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations, outperforming 2D/3D baselines and enabling efficient downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard deep learning struggles with ultrasound video analysis due to non-standardized acquisition and operator bias.

Method: VidFuncta disentangles videos into static and time-dependent modulation vectors using implicit neural representations.

Result: Outperforms baselines on reconstruction and downstream tasks like ejection fraction prediction and lesion classification.

Conclusion: VidFuncta is a generalizable, efficient framework for ultrasound video analysis.

Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning
methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized
acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video
analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an
INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that
conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal
domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose
VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length
ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta
disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of
time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and
dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video
reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned
1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video
datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream
performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast
lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a
generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our
code is publicly available under

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Cyst-X, an AI framework, predicts IPMN malignancy using MRI data, outperforming current guidelines and radiologists, and supports federated learning for privacy-preserving collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pancreatic cancer's rising mortality and the limitations of current IPMN assessment methods necessitate better early detection tools.

Method: Cyst-X uses multicenter MRI data (T1- and T2-weighted scans) from 764 patients across seven institutions, trained with AI to predict malignancy.

Result: Achieves AUC=0.82, surpassing Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert radiologists, with biologically meaningful insights.

Conclusion: Cyst-X improves IPMN risk stratification, supports federated learning, and releases a large-scale MRI dataset for collaborative, privacy-preserving AI development.

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in
Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early
detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to
pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often
leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an
AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data,
leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and
738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models
(AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert
radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers
and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong
performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training
without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and
improve IPMN risk stratification, the Cyst-X dataset is released as the first
large-scale, multi-center pancreatic cysts MRI dataset.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Cardiac-CLIP is a multi-modal foundation model for 3D cardiac CT images, using a two-stage pre-training strategy (self-supervised and contrastive learning) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cardiovascular diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored application of foundation models in complex cardiovascular diagnostics.

Method: Two-stage pre-training: 1) 3D masked autoencoder for self-supervised learning, 2) contrastive learning to align visual and textual representations. Uses large-scale clinical and public data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like abnormality classification and acute coronary syndrome prediction.

Conclusion: Cardiac-CLIP is highly effective for complex cardiovascular diagnostics, demonstrating strong performance across diverse tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain.
However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation
model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a
two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked
autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture
rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive
learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations,
facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect
16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data.
Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates
and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based
on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive
learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the
effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12
independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the
evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated
across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification,
information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate
that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP
exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the
prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously
difficult in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: ReXGroundingCT is a manually annotated dataset linking free-text radiology findings to 3D CT scan segmentations, addressing the gap in connecting descriptive text to precise anatomical locations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in medical AI by enabling the connection of complex clinical language to spatially localized 3D segmentations in volumetric imaging.

Method: A three-stage pipeline using GPT-4 to extract findings, followed by manual segmentation by experts and quality control by radiologists.

Result: The dataset includes 3,142 CT scans with 8,028 annotated findings, categorized into focal (79%) and non-focal (21%) abnormalities.

Conclusion: ReXGroundingCT sets a new benchmark for sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models in chest CT.

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link
free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT
scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on
structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full
expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to
spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This
addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,
descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise
anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for
grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142
non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the
CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to
extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented
by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were
annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.
Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.
The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,
while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding
entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and
evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models
in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can reason about and induce trust in human relationships, particularly in digital interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust is vital for cooperation and healthy relationships, especially in digital interactions. AI can help users understand and foster trust.

Method: Investigates LLMs' ability to reason about trust and role-play to induce trust in interactions.

Result: Assesses LLMs' capability in trust reasoning and trust-inducing actions.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential in understanding and fostering trust in digital human interactions.

Abstract: In human society, trust is an essential component of social attitude that
helps build and maintain long-term, healthy relationships which creates a
strong foundation for cooperation, enabling individuals to work together
effectively and achieve shared goals. As many human interactions occur through
electronic means such as using mobile apps, the potential arises for AI systems
to assist users in understanding the social state of their relationships. In
this paper we investigate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason
about trust between two individuals in an environment which requires fostering
trust relationships. We also assess whether LLMs are capable of inducing trust
by role-playing one party in a trust based interaction and planning actions
which can instil trust.

*Xiaotian Su,Naim Zierau,Soomin Kim,April Yi Wang,Thiemo Wambsganss*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes emotion monitoring dashboards to enhance users' emotional awareness and reduce hate speech on social media, showing effectiveness but also unintended negative emotional expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address criticisms of proactive moderation (e.g., censorship) and tackle the root causes of uncivil behavior by focusing on emotional awareness.

Method: Evaluated two types of emotion monitoring dashboards with 211 participants, analyzing their impact on commenting behavior and emotional experiences.

Result: Increased emotional awareness and reduced hate speech, but also unintended rise in negative emotions (Angry, Fear, Sad) during sensitive discussions.

Conclusion: Emotion regulation tools show promise for healthier digital interactions but require further research to mitigate unintended effects.

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VizGenie is a self-improving framework for scientific visualization using LLMs to generate and validate scripts, offering a natural language interface and VQA for intuitive interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce cognitive overhead in scientific visualization by combining domain-specific tools with LLM-driven adaptability.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate visualization scripts, validates them automatically, and integrates them. Features a natural language interface and VQA for query interpretation.

Result: Significantly reduces cognitive overhead in iterative visualization tasks and enhances adaptability.

Conclusion: VizGenie accelerates insight generation and establishes a sustainable, evolving visualization practice.

Abstract: We present VizGenie, a self-improving, agentic framework that advances
scientific visualization through large language model (LLM) by orchestrating of
a collection of domain-specific and dynamically generated modules. Users
initially access core functionalities--such as threshold-based filtering, slice
extraction, and statistical analysis--through pre-existing tools. For tasks
beyond this baseline, VizGenie autonomously employs LLMs to generate new
visualization scripts (e.g., VTK Python code), expanding its capabilities
on-demand. Each generated script undergoes automated backend validation and is
seamlessly integrated upon successful testing, continuously enhancing the
system's adaptability and robustness. A distinctive feature of VizGenie is its
intuitive natural language interface, allowing users to issue high-level
feature-based queries (e.g., ``visualize the skull"). The system leverages
image-based analysis and visual question answering (VQA) via fine-tuned vision
models to interpret these queries precisely, bridging domain expertise and
technical implementation. Additionally, users can interactively query generated
visualizations through VQA, facilitating deeper exploration. Reliability and
reproducibility are further strengthened by Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), providing context-driven responses while maintaining comprehensive
provenance records. Evaluations on complex volumetric datasets demonstrate
significant reductions in cognitive overhead for iterative visualization tasks.
By integrating curated domain-specific tools with LLM-driven flexibility,
VizGenie not only accelerates insight generation but also establishes a
sustainable, continuously evolving visualization practice. The resulting
platform dynamically learns from user interactions, consistently enhancing
support for feature-centric exploration and reproducible research in scientific
visualization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the FingerTip benchmark to address limitations in mobile GUI agents, focusing on proactive intent anticipation and personalized task execution using user context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile GUI agents lack proactive intent anticipation and fail to leverage user contextual information, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The FingerTip benchmark includes two tracks: proactive task suggestions and personalized task execution, using human demonstrations of multi-step Android interactions.

Result: Experiments show the model fine-tuned with the collected data effectively utilizes user information, achieving good results.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for building more user-oriented mobile GUI agents, with open-source code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents are becoming critical tools for enhancing human-device
interaction efficiency, with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerging
as dominant paradigms in this domain. Current agents, however, are limited to
following explicit human instructions, resulting in insufficient capability for
proactive intent anticipation. Additionally, these agents fail to leverage the
contextual information associated with users during task execution, thereby
neglecting potentially vast differences in user preferences. To address these
challenges, we introduce the FingerTip benchmark. It contains two new tracks:
proactive task suggestions by analyzing environment observation and users'
previous intents, and personalized task execution by catering to users' action
preferences. We collected unique human demonstrations of multi-step Android
device interactions across a variety of everyday apps. These demonstrations are
not isolated but are continuously acquired from the users' long-term usage in
their real lives, and encompass essential user-related contextual information.
Our experiments reveal challenges of the tasks we propose. The model fine-tuned
with the data we collected effectively utilized user information and achieved
good results, highlighting the potential of our approach in building more
user-oriented mobile GUI agents. Our code is open-source at

TL;DR: Educators integrated custom GPT tools in a Qualitative Research Methods course, enhancing student reflexivity and analytic skills but raising concerns about cognitive overload and AI's formulaic nature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in AI's role in qualitative education and shift from passive student use to educator-led AI design.

Method: Used the TPACK framework and action research to design GPTs for tasks like research question formulation and interview practice, analyzing student reflections and AI logs.

Result: Tools improved reflexivity and interview techniques but caused cognitive overload and reduced data immersion.

Conclusion: Educator-led AI design fosters reflective and collaborative learning, positioning AI as a scaffold and cognitive partner.

Abstract: As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is
a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively
shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors
integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research
Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the
dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in
qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support
disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action
research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as
research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and
design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and
final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity,
improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking.
However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced
immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers
three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when
paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in
iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to
pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging
scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators
to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and
collaborative learning with AI.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper highlights biased AI data representation marginalizing autistic people, proposes Neuro-Inclusive AI, and introduces AUTALIC for better autistic representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the exclusion of autistic perspectives in AI, which stems from biased datasets and ethical neglect.

Method: Empirical experiments with annotators and LLMs to improve data representation, leading to the creation of AUTALIC.

Result: 90% of human-like AI agents exclude autistic views; AUTALIC effectively labels anti-autistic hate speech.

Conclusion: Neuro-Inclusive AI and AUTALIC can mitigate biases and foster more inclusive AI systems.

Abstract: Biased data representation in AI marginalizes up to 75 million autistic
people worldwide through medical applications viewing autism as a deficit of
neurotypical social skills rather than an aspect of human diversity, and this
perspective is grounded in research questioning the humanity of autistic
people. Turing defined artificial intelligence as the ability to mimic human
communication, and as AI development increasingly focuses on human-like agents,
this benchmark remains popular. In contrast, we define Neuro-Inclusive AI as
datasets and systems that move away from mimicking humanness as a benchmark for
machine intelligence. Then, we explore the origins, prevalence, and impact of
anti-autistic biases in current research. Our work finds that 90% of human-like
AI agents exclude autistic perspectives, and AI creators continue to believe
ethical considerations are beyond the scope of their work. To improve the
autistic representation in data, we conduct empirical experiments with
annotators and LLMs, finding that binary labeling schemes sufficiently capture
the nuances of labeling anti-autistic hate speech. Our benchmark, AUTALIC, can
be used to evaluate or fine-tune models, and was developed to serve as a
foundation for more neuro-inclusive future work.

TL;DR: The paper explores how emotion influences explanations in social interactions, proposing a computational framework to model this and validating it with human intuitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of emotion in explanations as a cooperative social interaction.

Method: Developed a computational framework modeling explainers' consideration of emotional impact on listeners, tested with human intuitions about doctor-patient explanations.

Result: The model predicted human intuitions better than emotion-agnostic alternatives, indicating people consider emotion in explanations.

Conclusion: People reason about emotion when giving explanations, supporting the social interaction perspective.

Abstract: Why do we give the explanations we do? Recent work has suggested that we
should think of explanation as a kind of cooperative social interaction,
between a why-question-asker and an explainer. Here, we apply this perspective
to consider the role that emotion plays in this social interaction. We develop
a computational framework for modeling explainers who consider the emotional
impact an explanation might have on a listener. We test our framework by using
it to model human intuitions about how a doctor might explain to a patient why
they have a disease, taking into account the patient's propensity for regret.
Our model predicts human intuitions well, better than emotion-agnostic
ablations, suggesting that people do indeed reason about emotion when giving
explanations.

TL;DR: Interactive simulations improve AI literacy by fostering deep understanding through hypothesis testing and experimentation, outperforming traditional methods like blogs or static lessons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in deep conceptual understanding and critical engagement in AI literacy education, which traditional methods often fail to achieve.

Method: A controlled study with 605 participants tested the impact of interactive AI tutorials on learning key concepts like fairness, dataset representativeness, and bias in language models.

Result: Interactive simulations enhanced AI literacy, improving knowledge transfer and confidence, though engagement alone didn't predict learning.

Conclusion: Interactive, inquiry-driven methods are effective for AI literacy, equipping individuals to critically engage with AI in daily life.

Abstract: As AI systems shape individual and societal decisions, fostering critical AI
literacy is essential. Traditional approaches, such as blog articles, static
lessons, and social media discussions, often fail to support deep conceptual
understanding and critical engagement. This study examines whether interactive
simulations can help learners think like a scientist by engaging them in
hypothesis testing, experimentation, and direct observation of AI behavior. In
a controlled study with 605 participants, we assess how interactive AI
tutorials impact learning of key concepts such as fairness, dataset
representativeness, and bias in language models. Results show that interactive
simulations effectively enhance AI literacy across topics, supporting greater
knowledge transfer and self-reported confidence, though engagement alone does
not predict learning. This work contributes to the growing field of AI literacy
education, highlighting how interactive, inquiry-driven methodologies can

TL;DR: ProMemAssist is a smart glasses system that models working memory in real-time to provide context-sensitive assistance, outperforming an LLM baseline in user engagement and selectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing wearable AI systems lack consideration for users' current mental states, relying on user initiation or predefined tasks.

Method: ProMemAssist uses multi-modal sensor signals to model working memory, incorporating cognitive theories like displacement and interference, and includes a timing predictor for assistance.

Result: In a study with 12 participants, ProMemAssist provided more selective assistance and higher engagement than an LLM baseline.

Conclusion: ProMemAssist demonstrates the value of working memory modeling for nuanced, proactive AI assistance, with broader implications for user-aware systems.

Abstract: Wearable AI systems aim to provide timely assistance in daily life, but
existing approaches often rely on user initiation or predefined task knowledge,
neglecting users' current mental states. We introduce ProMemAssist, a smart
glasses system that models a user's working memory (WM) in real-time using
multi-modal sensor signals. Grounded in cognitive theories of WM, our system
represents perceived information as memory items and episodes with encoding
mechanisms, such as displacement and interference. This WM model informs a
timing predictor that balances the value of assistance with the cost of
interruption. In a user study with 12 participants completing cognitively
demanding tasks, ProMemAssist delivered more selective assistance and received
higher engagement compared to an LLM baseline system. Qualitative feedback
highlights the benefits of WM modeling for nuanced, context-sensitive support,
offering design implications for more attentive and user-aware proactive
agents.

TL;DR: AI literacy (self-efficacy, understanding, skills) predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement with AI tools in education, influencing perceived learning effectiveness. Prior AI exposure has no significant impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI literacy and prior exposure shape student perceptions of AI tools in education, aiming to improve learning outcomes.

Method: Surveyed 309 undergraduates in CS and Business, using validated surveys and partial least squares structural equation modeling.

Result: AI literacy predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement, which in turn predict learning effectiveness. Prior AI exposure had no effect.

Conclusion: AI literacy is key for effective AI tool use; designers should focus on adaptive guidance and user-centered features for inclusivity.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher
education, understanding how students interact with these systems is essential
to supporting effective learning. This study examines how students' AI literacy
and prior exposure to AI technologies shape their perceptions of Socratic Mind,
an interactive AI-powered formative assessment tool. Drawing on
Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we analyze
relationships among AI literacy, perceived usability, satisfaction, engagement,
and perceived learning effectiveness. Data from 309 undergraduates in Computer
Science and Business courses were collected through validated surveys. Partial
least squares structural equation modeling showed that AI literacy - especially
self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly
predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction,
in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness, while prior AI
exposure showed no significant effect. These findings highlight that AI
literacy, rather than exposure alone, shapes student experiences. Designers
should integrate adaptive guidance and user-centered features to support
diverse literacy levels, fostering inclusive, motivating, and effective
AI-based learning environments.

### [356] [MapAgent: Trajectory-Constructed Memory-Augmented Planning for Mobile Task Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21953)
*Yi Kong,Dianxi Shi,Guoli Yang,Zhang ke-di,Chenlin Huang,Xiaopeng Li,Songchang Jin*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: MapAgent is an LLM-based framework that uses historical task trajectories to improve mobile task automation, addressing challenges like knowledge gaps and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents struggle with complex real-world mobile tasks due to insufficient knowledge of apps, leading to ineffective planning.

Method: MapAgent employs a trajectory-based memory mechanism and a coarse-to-fine planning approach, leveraging a dual-LLM architecture for execution.

Result: MapAgent outperforms existing methods in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances task automation by leveraging memory and context-aware planning, with plans to open-source the code.

Abstract: The recent advancement of autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated significant potential for automating tasks on mobile
devices through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Despite initial progress,
these agents still face challenges when handling complex real-world tasks.
These challenges arise from a lack of knowledge about real-life mobile
applications in LLM-based agents, which may lead to ineffective task planning
and even cause hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
LLM-based agent framework called MapAgent that leverages memory constructed
from historical trajectories to augment current task planning. Specifically, we
first propose a trajectory-based memory mechanism that transforms task
execution trajectories into a reusable and structured page-memory database.
Each page within a trajectory is extracted as a compact yet comprehensive
snapshot, capturing both its UI layout and functional context. Secondly, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine task planning approach that retrieves relevant pages
from the memory database based on similarity and injects them into the LLM
planner to compensate for potential deficiencies in understanding real-world
app scenarios, thereby achieving more informed and context-aware task planning.
Finally, planned tasks are transformed into executable actions through a task
executor supported by a dual-LLM architecture, ensuring effective tracking of
task progress. Experimental results in real-world scenarios demonstrate that
MapAgent achieves superior performance to existing methods. The code will be
open-sourced to support further research.

*Justin Curry,Brennan Lagasse,Ngoc B. Lam,Gregory Cox,David Rosenbluth,Alberto Speranzon*

Main category: math.AT

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the embedding space of a transformer-based RL model in a coin-collecting game, revealing it as a stratified space with varying local dimensions. It extends Robinson's method and suggests dimension distribution as a geometric complexity indicator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based PPO models embed visual inputs in RL games and explore the geometric properties of their latent spaces.

Method: Adapts Robinson et al.'s volume growth transform to RL, analyzes embedding space structure, and proves general volume growth curves for stratified spaces.

Result: The embedding space is stratified, with local dimension varying during agent actions—low during sub-strategies and high during sub-goals or increased environmental complexity.

Conclusion: Stratified latent space dimensions may serve as a new geometric indicator of RL game complexity.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a
transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL)
game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an
agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of
"spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth
transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space
for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better
modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to
point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general
volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry
out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent
representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while
following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the
agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the
environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently,
our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent
space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly
facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still
facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction
with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by
Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few
applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS
framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular
multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling
dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified
conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction
without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks
including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis.
Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged
96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query
decomposition, dynamic routing, and domain-specific, relevant responses.
Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of
domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

TL;DR: FedFlex is a federated recommender system for TV series, enhancing diversity without compromising user satisfaction by integrating matrix factorization and MMR re-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated recommendation systems prioritize accuracy over fairness and diversity, which FedFlex aims to address.

Method: Combines SVD and BPR matrix factorization algorithms with MMR re-ranking to diversify recommendations.

Result: FedFlex successfully introduces diverse content (e.g., new genres) while maintaining user satisfaction in a live study.

Conclusion: FedFlex balances diversity and user satisfaction, proving viable for federated recommendation systems.

Abstract: Federated learning is a decentralized approach that enables collaborative
model training across multiple devices while preserving data privacy. It has
shown significant potential in various domains, including healthcare and
personalized recommendation systems. However, most existing work on federated
recommendation systems has focused primarily on improving accuracy, with
limited attention to fairness and diversity. In this paper, we introduce
FedFlex, a federated recommender system for Netflix-style TV series
recommendations. FedFlex integrates two state-of-the-art matrix factorization
algorithms for personalized fine-tuning. FedFlex also applies Maximal Marginal
Relevance (MMR) to re-rank items and enhance diversity. We conduct extensive
experiments comparing recommendations generated by SVD and BPR algorithms. In a
live two-week user study, participants received two recommendation lists: List
A, based on SVD or BPR, and List B, a re-ranked version emphasizing diversity.
Participants were asked to click on the movies they were interested in
watching. Our findings demonstrate that FedFlex effectively introduces diverse
content, such as new genres, into recommendations without necessarily
compromising user satisfaction.

TL;DR: The paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can address challenges in recommender systems by unifying tasks like candidate retrieval, ranking, and conversational recommendations, enhancing personalization and semantic understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommender systems face issues like sparse data, cold-start problems, and limited personalization. LLMs offer a unified, language-native solution to overcome these limitations.

Method: The paper surveys LLM applications in recommender systems, including prompt-driven retrieval, language-native ranking, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendations.

Result: LLMs improve personalization, semantic alignment, and interpretability, enabling zero- and few-shot reasoning for cold-start and long-tail scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs are foundational for adaptive, semantically rich, and user-centric recommender systems, offering trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance.

Abstract: Recommender systems have traditionally followed modular architectures
comprising candidate generation, multi-stage ranking, and re-ranking, each
trained separately with supervised objectives and hand-engineered features.
While effective in many domains, such systems face persistent challenges
including sparse and noisy interaction data, cold-start problems, limited
personalization depth, and inadequate semantic understanding of user and item
content. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new
paradigm for addressing these limitations through unified, language-native
mechanisms that can generalize across tasks, domains, and modalities. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive technical survey of how LLMs can be leveraged
to tackle key challenges in modern recommender systems. We examine the use of
LLMs for prompt-driven candidate retrieval, language-native ranking,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and conversational recommendation,
illustrating how these approaches enhance personalization, semantic alignment,
and interpretability without requiring extensive task-specific supervision.
LLMs further enable zero- and few-shot reasoning, allowing systems to operate
effectively in cold-start and long-tail scenarios by leveraging external
knowledge and contextual cues. We categorize these emerging LLM-driven
architectures and analyze their effectiveness in mitigating core bottlenecks of
conventional pipelines. In doing so, we provide a structured framework for
understanding the design space of LLM-enhanced recommenders, and outline the
trade-offs between accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance. Our goal
is to demonstrate that LLMs are not merely auxiliary components but
foundational enablers for building more adaptive, semantically rich, and
user-centric recommender systems

TL;DR: The paper proposes cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods for Art Therapy (AT) using music-driven preference elicitation, showing it outperforms visual-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Visual Art Recommender Systems (VA RecSys) in AT rely on visual stimuli, limiting emotional response capture. Music stimuli offer unique affective reflections, suggesting CDR could enhance personalization.

Method: A family of CDR methods for AT based on music-driven preference elicitation is proposed and tested in a large-scale study with 200 users.

Result: Music-driven preference elicitation outperforms the classic visual-only approach, demonstrating its efficacy.

Conclusion: Music-driven CDR enhances AT personalization, offering a promising alternative to visual-only methods.

Abstract: Art Therapy (AT) is an established practice that facilitates emotional
processing and recovery through creative expression. Recently, Visual Art
Recommender Systems (VA RecSys) have emerged to support AT, demonstrating their
potential by personalizing therapeutic artwork recommendations. Nonetheless,
current VA RecSys rely on visual stimuli for user modeling, limiting their
ability to capture the full spectrum of emotional responses during preference
elicitation. Previous studies have shown that music stimuli elicit unique
affective reflections, presenting an opportunity for cross-domain
recommendation (CDR) to enhance personalization in AT. Since CDR has not yet
been explored in this context, we propose a family of CDR methods for AT based
on music-driven preference elicitation. A large-scale study with 200 users
demonstrates the efficacy of music-driven preference elicitation, outperforming
the classic visual-only elicitation approach. Our source code, data, and models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data sparsity and popularity bias in recommendation systems by leveraging LLMs to generate synthetic interactions.

Method: Few-shot prompting LLMs for item reranking, aggregating results via majority voting, and integrating augmented data into graph contrastive learning.

Result: Improved recommendation accuracy and reduced popularity bias, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates data sparsity and popularity bias, enhancing recommendation performance.

Abstract: Recommendation systems often suffer from data sparsity caused by limited
user-item interactions, which degrade their performance and amplify popularity
bias in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and item textual
descriptions to enrich interaction data. By few-shot prompting LLMs multiple
times to rerank items and aggregating the results via majority voting, we
generate high-confidence synthetic user-item interactions, supported by
theoretical guarantees based on the concentration of measure. To effectively
leverage the augmented data in the context of a graph recommendation system, we
integrate it into a graph contrastive learning framework to mitigate
distributional shift and alleviate popularity bias. Extensive experiments show
that our method improves accuracy and reduces popularity bias, outperforming
strong baselines.

Method: Builds a knowledge graph using semantic data from movie descriptions, analyzed by ChatGPT for tone extraction.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy compared to traditional genre-based methods.

Conclusion: Semantic analysis via large language models like ChatGPT offers a superior approach for personalized recommendations.

Abstract: The importance of recommender systems on the web has grown, especially in the
movie industry, with a vast selection of options to watch. To assist users in
traversing available items and finding relevant results, recommender systems
analyze operational data and investigate users' tastes and habits. Providing
highly individualized suggestions can boost user engagement and satisfaction,
which is one of the fundamental goals of the movie industry, significantly in
online platforms. According to recent studies and research, using
knowledge-based techniques and considering the semantic ideas of the textual
data is a suitable way to get more appropriate results. This study provides a
new method for building a knowledge graph based on semantic information. It
uses the ChatGPT, as a large language model, to assess the brief descriptions
of movies and extract their tone of voice. Results indicated that using the
proposed method may significantly enhance accuracy rather than employing the
explicit genres supplied by the publishers.

TL;DR: A quantum neural network is implemented on trapped-ion and IBM quantum computers for MNIST image classification, showing improved performance with quantum uncertainty and sensitivity to noise in borderline cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of quantum neural networks for image classification and investigate their performance compared to classical networks, especially in borderline cases.

Method: A quantum neural network is trained via simulation and tested experimentally on quantum hardware, with an interpolation parameter controlling classical-to-quantum transitions. Noise sensitivity is benchmarked by adding gate pairs.

Result: Moderate quantum uncertainty improves performance. Borderline cases show strong noise sensitivity, while clear images do not. Physical noise causes output fluctuations.

Conclusion: Quantum neural networks may offer advantages over classical ones, with potential for near-term quantum advantage as networks scale up.

Abstract: We implement a quantum generalization of a neural network on trapped-ion and
IBM superconducting quantum computers to classify MNIST images, a common
benchmark in computer vision. The network feedforward involves qubit rotations
whose angles depend on the results of measurements in the previous layer. The
network is trained via simulation, but inference is performed experimentally on
quantum hardware. The classical-to-quantum correspondence is controlled by an
interpolation parameter, $a$, which is zero in the classical limit. Increasing
$a$ introduces quantum uncertainty into the measurements, which is shown to
improve network performance at moderate values of the interpolation parameter.
We then focus on particular images that fail to be classified by a classical
neural network but are detected correctly in the quantum network. For such
borderline cases, we observe strong deviations from the simulated behavior. We
attribute this to physical noise, which causes the output to fluctuate between
nearby minima of the classification energy landscape. Such strong sensitivity
to physical noise is absent for clear images. We further benchmark physical
noise by inserting additional single-qubit and two-qubit gate pairs into the
neural network circuits. Our work provides a springboard toward more complex
quantum neural networks on current devices: while the approach is rooted in
standard classical machine learning, scaling up such networks may prove
classically non-simulable and could offer a route to near-term quantum
advantage.

Motivation: Addressing data volume and computational challenges in big data and AI by leveraging quantum computing for image processing.

Method: Comparison of four QImRs (TNR, FRQI, NEQR, QPIE) for compression and evaluation of quantum kernels vs. classical linear kernel in binary classification.

Result: FRQI outperforms others in compression; quantum kernels match classical accuracy with fewer resources.

Conclusion: Quantum image processing, especially FRQI and quantum kernels, offers efficient solutions for data challenges.

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off
between accuracy and memory in binary classification problems, evaluating the
performance of quantum kernels based on QImRs compared to the classical linear
kernel. Our results indicate that quantum kernels provide comparable
classification average accuracy but require exponentially fewer resources for
image storage.

Method: QKM transforms nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional spaces using a deep autoencoder and Koopman operators acting on phase components.

Result: Validated on diverse systems, QKM maintains errors below 6% and captures key statistics in complex dynamics like turbulence.

Conclusion: QKM provides a practical approach for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena by combining deep learning and quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating
certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is
inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the
quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap
through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in
higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to
achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a
hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized
embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase
components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators
that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from
diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed
for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables
direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity
scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is
validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative
errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key
statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for
quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework
built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum
algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.

### [371] [Improving Neural Network Training using Dynamic Learning Rate Schedule for PINNs and Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21749)
*D. Veerababu,Ashwin A. Raikar,Prasanta K. Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm adapts the learning rate based on training loss, improving training speed and stability in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static learning rates hinder training efficiency in complex systems; adaptability is needed for better gradient navigation.

Method: Proposes DLRS, which adjusts learning rates dynamically using loss values during training. Tested on PINNs and image classification tasks.

Result: DLRS accelerates training and enhances stability compared to static learning rates.

Conclusion: Dynamic learning rate adaptation is effective for optimizing neural network training.

Abstract: Training neural networks can be challenging, especially as the complexity of
the problem increases. Despite using wider or deeper networks, training them
can be a tedious process, especially if a wrong choice of the hyperparameter is
made. The learning rate is one of such crucial hyperparameters, which is
usually kept static during the training process. Learning dynamics in complex
systems often requires a more adaptive approach to the learning rate. This
adaptability becomes crucial to effectively navigate varying gradients and
optimize the learning process during the training process. In this paper, a
dynamic learning rate scheduler (DLRS) algorithm is presented that adapts the
learning rate based on the loss values calculated during the training process.
Experiments are conducted on problems related to physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) and image classification using multilayer perceptrons and
convolutional neural networks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the
proposed DLRS accelerates training and improves stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) lack deep domain understanding and reasoning in chemistry, limiting their scientific application.

Method: Constructed a dataset of atomized knowledge points, used mix-sourced distillation (expert-curated knowledge + general reasoning), and applied domain-specific reinforcement learning.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on chemical benchmarks with interpretable, rationale-driven outputs.

Conclusion: Explicit reasoning chains improve reliability, transparency, and utility in human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress, their
application in scientific domains such as chemistry remains hindered by shallow
domain understanding and limited reasoning capabilities. In this work, we focus
on the specific field of chemistry and develop a Chemical Reasoner LLM,
ChemDFM-R. We first construct a comprehensive dataset of atomized knowledge
points to enhance the model's understanding of the fundamental principles and
logical structure of chemistry. Then, we propose a mix-sourced distillation
strategy that integrates expert-curated knowledge with general-domain reasoning
skills, followed by domain-specific reinforcement learning to enhance chemical
reasoning. Experiments on diverse chemical benchmarks demonstrate that
ChemDFM-R achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable,
rationale-driven outputs. Further case studies illustrate how explicit
reasoning chains significantly improve the reliability, transparency, and
practical utility of the model in real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios.

*Katerina Marie Simkova,Adrien Doerig,Clayton Hickey,Ian Charest*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The study explores shared representational formats between vision and language, showing convergence in human behavior and brain responses, with LLM-embeddings outperforming other models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how vision and language share a common representational space and how this manifests in human behavior and brain responses.

Method: Sixty-three participants judged similarities of 100 natural scene images and corresponding captions. Computational models mapped images to LLM-embeddings.

Result: Visual and linguistic similarity judgements converge behaviorally and predict similar fMRI brain responses. LLM-based models outperformed controls.

Conclusion: Human similarity judgements reflect a shared, modality-agnostic representational structure, mirroring visual system encoding and suggesting common conceptual representation formation.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly describe what they see, yet establishing a shared
representational format between vision and language remains a significant
challenge. Emerging evidence suggests that human brain representations in both
vision and language are well predicted by semantic feature spaces obtained from
large language models (LLMs). This raises the possibility that sensory systems
converge in their inherent ability to transform their inputs onto shared,
embedding-like representational space. However, it remains unclear how such a
space manifests in human behaviour. To investigate this, sixty-three
participants performed behavioural similarity judgements separately on 100
natural scene images and 100 corresponding sentence captions from the Natural
Scenes Dataset. We found that visual and linguistic similarity judgements not
only converge at the behavioural level but also predict a remarkably similar
network of fMRI brain responses evoked by viewing the natural scene images.
Furthermore, computational models trained to map images onto LLM-embeddings
outperformed both category-trained and AlexNet controls in explaining the
behavioural similarity structure. These findings demonstrate that human visual
and linguistic similarity judgements are grounded in a shared,
modality-agnostic representational structure that mirrors how the visual system
encodes experience. The convergence between sensory and artificial systems
suggests a common capacity of how conceptual representations are formed-not as
arbitrary products of first order, modality-specific input, but as structured
representations that reflect the stable, relational properties of the external
world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the behavior and evolution of dynamical many-body systems, particularly hierarchically organized materials like liquid crystal skyrmions, through image analysis.

Method: Combines joint geometric and topological data analysis (TDA), introducing the Ψ-function for spatiotemporal changes and vector field analysis for nonlinear mechanisms.

Result: Provides insights into system responses to stimuli and enables comparison with theoretical predictions, applicable to various real-world systems.

Conclusion: The methodology is general and scalable, linking image analysis to physical, chemical, or biological processes.

Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by
analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising
method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems.
The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative
example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex
spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and
topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating
such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple
scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust
numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in
the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of
regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based
on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles
offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response
to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical
predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a
characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual
pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of
image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or
biological system in the real world.

*Zhanhong Cheng,Lingqian Hu,Yuheng Bu,Yuqi Zhou,Shenhao Wang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for discrete choice analysis, specifically for residential location choice, to capture relationships among alternatives while maintaining ties to classical utility theory. GNN-DCMs outperform traditional models and neural networks in predictive performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches fail to explicitly model relationships among choice alternatives, a key focus in classical discrete choice models.

Method: The paper proposes GNN-based discrete choice models (GNN-DCMs) to capture spatial dependencies among alternatives, linking them to random utility theory. The models generalize nested logit and spatially correlated logit models.

Result: GNN-DCMs outperform MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural networks in predicting residential location choices in Chicago, capturing individual heterogeneity and spatial substitution patterns.

Conclusion: GNN-DCMs offer a unified framework combining deep learning and discrete choice modeling, particularly effective for complex spatial choices.

Abstract: Researchers have adopted deep learning for classical discrete choice analysis
as it can capture complex feature relationships and achieve higher predictive
performance. However, the existing deep learning approaches cannot explicitly
capture the relationship among choice alternatives, which has been a
long-lasting focus in classical discrete choice models. To address the gap,
this paper introduces Graph Neural Network (GNN) as a novel framework to
analyze residential location choice. The GNN-based discrete choice models
(GNN-DCMs) offer a structured approach for neural networks to capture
dependence among spatial alternatives, while maintaining clear connections to
classical random utility theory. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the
GNN-DCMs incorporate the nested logit (NL) model and the spatially correlated
logit (SCL) model as two specific cases, yielding novel algorithmic
interpretation through message passing among alternatives' utilities.
Empirically, the GNN-DCMs outperform benchmark MNL, SCL, and feedforward neural
networks in predicting residential location choices among Chicago's 77
community areas. Regarding model interpretation, the GNN-DCMs can capture
individual heterogeneity and exhibit spatially-aware substitution patterns.
Overall, these results highlight the potential of GNN-DCMs as a unified and
expressive framework for synergizing discrete choice modeling and deep learning
in the complex spatial choice contexts.

*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explains why gradient descent (GD) converges exponentially in practice by proving that locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs) satisfy a local Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition under Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability. This leads to linear convergence rates, matching empirical observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The discrepancy between theoretical sublinear convergence rates of GD in LQCRs and the exponential rates observed in practice motivates the need for a deeper understanding of the loss landscape in deep neural networks (DNNs).

Method: The authors introduce Locally Polyak-Lojasiewicz Regions (LPLRs), prove their existence around initialization for finite-width networks under NTK stability, and show GD achieves linear convergence within LPLRs.

Result: The theory is validated across diverse settings, including fully-connected networks and ResNet architectures, confirming the robust emergence of LPLR structure in practice.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for the efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning by linking local landscape geometry to fast convergence through the NTK framework.

Abstract: The convergence of gradient descent (GD) on the non-convex loss landscapes of
deep neural networks (DNNs) presents a fundamental theoretical challenge. While
recent work has established that GD converges to a stationary point at a
sublinear rate within locally quasi-convex regions (LQCRs), this fails to
explain the exponential convergence rates consistently observed in practice. In
this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by proving that under a mild assumption
on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) stability, these same regions satisfy a local
Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. We introduce the concept of a Locally
Polyak-Lojasiewicz Region (LPLR), where the squared gradient norm lower-bounds
the suboptimality gap, prove that properly initialized finite-width networks
admit such regions around initialization, and establish that GD achieves linear
convergence within an LPLR, providing the first finite-width guarantee that
matches empirically observed rates. We validate our theory across diverse
settings, from controlled experiments on fully-connected networks to modern
ResNet architectures trained with stochastic methods, demonstrating that LPLR
structure emerges robustly in practical deep learning scenarios. By rigorously
connecting local landscape geometry to fast optimization through the NTK
framework, our work provides a definitive theoretical explanation for the
remarkable efficiency of gradient-based optimization in deep learning.

### [378] [Measuring Sample Quality with Copula Discrepancies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21434)
*Agnideep Aich,Ashit Baran Aich,Bruce Wade*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a diagnostic tool for assessing dependence structure in biased MCMC samples, outperforming traditional methods like effective sample size and Stein-based diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sample quality measures fail for biased samplers, and existing Stein-based diagnostics lack direct assessment of dependence structure, a key inferential target in multivariate problems.

Method: The authors propose the Copula Discrepancy (CD), leveraging Sklar's theorem to isolate and quantify dependence structure fidelity independent of marginals. They provide theoretical and empirical validation, including moment-based and MLE-based variants.

Result: CD outperforms standard diagnostics in hyperparameter selection for biased MCMC and detects subtle mismatches in tail dependence, even when rank correlation-based methods fail.

Conclusion: CD offers practical value for MCMC practitioners and a theoretical foundation for structure-aware sample quality assessment, with low computational overhead.

Abstract: The scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that underpin modern
Bayesian machine learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics
(SGLD), sacrifice asymptotic exactness for computational speed, creating a
critical diagnostic gap: traditional sample quality measures fail
catastrophically when applied to biased samplers. While powerful Stein-based
diagnostics can detect distributional mismatches, they provide no direct
assessment of dependence structure, often the primary inferential target in
multivariate problems. We introduce the Copula Discrepancy (CD), a principled
and computationally efficient diagnostic that leverages Sklar's theorem to
isolate and quantify the fidelity of a sample's dependence structure
independent of its marginals. Our theoretical framework provides the first
structure-aware diagnostic specifically designed for the era of approximate
inference. Empirically, we demonstrate that a moment-based CD dramatically
outperforms standard diagnostics like effective sample size for hyperparameter
selection in biased MCMC, correctly identifying optimal configurations where
traditional methods fail. Furthermore, our robust MLE-based variant can detect
subtle but critical mismatches in tail dependence that remain invisible to rank
correlation-based approaches, distinguishing between samples with identical
Kendall's tau but fundamentally different extreme-event behavior. With
computational overhead orders of magnitude lower than existing Stein
discrepancies, the CD provides both immediate practical value for MCMC
practitioners and a theoretical foundation for the next generation of
structure-aware sample quality assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SGMCMC global convergence assumptions may not hold for degenerate loss landscapes, necessitating a focus on local sampling.

Method: Introduces a scalable benchmark for evaluating local sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms, testing common methods like RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD.

Result: RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD best captures local posterior geometry, even in large models (O(100M) parameters).

Conclusion: Local sampling provides valuable insights despite lacking global convergence guarantees, with practical implications for large-scale models.

Abstract: Degeneracy is an inherent feature of the loss landscape of neural networks,
but it is not well understood how stochastic gradient MCMC (SGMCMC) algorithms
interact with this degeneracy. In particular, current global convergence
guarantees for common SGMCMC algorithms rely on assumptions which are likely
incompatible with degenerate loss landscapes. In this paper, we argue that this
gap requires a shift in focus from global to local posterior sampling, and, as
a first step, we introduce a novel scalable benchmark for evaluating the local
sampling performance of SGMCMC algorithms. We evaluate a number of common
algorithms, and find that RMSProp-preconditioned SGLD is most effective at
faithfully representing the local geometry of the posterior distribution.
Although we lack theoretical guarantees about global sampler convergence, our
empirical results show that we are able to extract non-trivial local
information in models with up to O(100M) parameters.

Motivation: To understand and predict the complex dynamics of forest transitions and deforestation trends.

Method: Developed a stochastic differential equation model, ensured global positive solutions, and proposed a deep learning approach for parameter estimation.

Result: The model captures forest transition dynamics, and the deep learning method enables parameter estimation from limited data.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into deforestation trends and future forest transition dynamics.

Abstract: Forest transitions, characterized by dynamic shifts between forest,
agricultural, and abandoned lands, are complex phenomena. This study developed
a stochastic differential equation model to capture the intricate dynamics of
these transitions. We established the existence of global positive solutions
for the model and conducted numerical analyses to assess the impact of model
parameters on deforestation incentives. To address the challenge of parameter
estimation, we proposed a novel deep learning approach that estimates all model
parameters from a single sample containing time-series observations of forest
and agricultural land proportions. This innovative approach enables us to
understand forest transition dynamics and deforestation trends at any future
time.

TL;DR: The paper shows that $N$ sorted sample points partition the real line into $N+1$ segments, each with an expected probability mass of $1/(N+1)$, providing a non-parametric way to infer properties of any continuous distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand what can be inferred about a continuous probability distribution from a finite sample of observations, focusing on non-parametric methods.

Method: Uses order statistics to partition the real line into $N+1$ segments with equal expected probability mass, deriving a discrete entropy measure.

Result: The partition yields a discrete entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, contrasting with Shannon's continuous entropy, and offers insights for robust non-parametric inference.

Conclusion: The framework provides a novel non-parametric approach for density and tail estimation, complementing traditional methods like the ECDF.

Abstract: This paper investigates what can be inferred about an arbitrary continuous
probability distribution from a finite sample of $N$ observations drawn from
it. The central finding is that the $N$ sorted sample points partition the real
line into $N+1$ segments, each carrying an expected probability mass of exactly
$1/(N+1)$. This non-parametric result, which follows from fundamental
properties of order statistics, holds regardless of the underlying
distribution's shape. This equal-probability partition yields a discrete
entropy of $\log_2(N+1)$ bits, which quantifies the information gained from the
sample and contrasts with Shannon's results for continuous variables. I compare
this partition-based framework to the conventional ECDF and discuss its
implications for robust non-parametric inference, particularly in density and
tail estimation.

*Robert Kuchen*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIBoost, a method for variable selection in gradient boosting that handles missing data by unifying coefficients across imputed datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of model selection with missing data, where existing methods are either suboptimal or complex.

Method: Extends gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, which ensures uniform variable selection across multiple imputed datasets.

Result: Simulations show MIBoost performs comparably to recent methods like LASSO and elastic nets.

Conclusion: MIBoost offers a practical solution for variable selection in missing data scenarios, balancing performance and simplicity.

Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO,
elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for
building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often
complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address
missingness is multiple imputation, which creates several completed datasets.
However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the
presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling
models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although
more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and
therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the
regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss
function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our
key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise
gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a
uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation
studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to
that of these recently proposed methods.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: Supervised machine learning models (logistic regression, XGBoost, MLP) predict VBAC using CDC data. MLP performed best (AUC=0.7287), with key predictors like BMI and education. Models show clinical utility for scalable VBAC prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of VBAC is crucial for prenatal counseling and reducing delivery risks, especially in settings lacking specialized intrapartum data.

Method: Used CDC WONDER Natality dataset (2017-2023) with 643,029 TOLAC cases. Trained logistic regression, XGBoost, and MLP classifiers on 47 prenatal features, addressing class imbalance with weighting and custom loss functions.

Result: MLP achieved highest AUC (0.7287), followed by XGBoost (0.727), both outperforming logistic regression (0.709). Key predictors included maternal BMI, education, and comorbidities.

Conclusion: Routinely collected prenatal data can support scalable, moderately high-performing VBAC prediction models, aiding clinical decision-making in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the outcome of a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC)
is essential for guiding prenatal counseling and minimizing delivery-related
risks. This study presents supervised machine learning models for predicting
vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) using 643,029 TOLAC cases from the CDC
WONDER Natality dataset (2017-2023). After filtering for singleton births with
one or two prior cesareans and complete data across 47 prenatal-period
features, three classifiers were trained: logistic regression, XGBoost, and a
multilayer perceptron (MLP). The MLP achieved the highest performance with an
AUC of 0.7287, followed closely by XGBoost (AUC = 0.727), both surpassing the
logistic regression baseline (AUC = 0.709). To address class imbalance, class
weighting was applied to the MLP, and a custom loss function was implemented in
XGBoost. Evaluation metrics included ROC curves, confusion matrices, and
precision-recall analysis. Logistic regression coefficients highlighted
maternal BMI, education, parity, comorbidities, and prenatal care indicators as
key predictors. Overall, the results demonstrate that routinely collected,
early-pregnancy variables can support scalable and moderately high-performing
VBAC prediction models. These models offer potential utility in clinical
decision support, particularly in settings lacking access to specialized
intrapartum data.

TL;DR: The paper introduces anchor boosting, a tree-based extension of anchor regression, to improve domain generalization in ICU predictive models across diverse hospitals. It also proposes a framework to quantify the utility of external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predictive models degrade in new clinical settings due to distribution shifts. The study aims to enhance out-of-distribution performance using causality-inspired methods.

Method: Applies anchor regression and introduces anchor boosting on a large dataset of 400,000 ICU patients from nine databases. Tests robustness to theoretical violations and proposes a framework for external data utility.

Result: Anchor regularization improves performance, especially for dissimilar domains. The method is robust to anchor exogeneity violations. The framework identifies three data utility regimes.

Conclusion: The study successfully enhances domain generalization and provides actionable insights for leveraging external data in clinical predictive modeling.

Abstract: The performance of predictive models in clinical settings often degrades when
deployed in new hospitals due to distribution shifts. This paper presents a
large-scale study of causality-inspired domain generalization on heterogeneous
multi-center intensive care unit (ICU) data. We apply anchor regression and
introduce anchor boosting, a novel, tree-based nonlinear extension, to a large
dataset comprising 400,000 patients from nine distinct ICU databases. The
anchor regularization consistently improves out-of-distribution performance,
particularly for the most dissimilar target domains. The methods appear robust
to violations of theoretical assumptions, such as anchor exogeneity.
Furthermore, we propose a novel conceptual framework to quantify the utility of
large external data datasets. By evaluating performance as a function of
available target-domain data, we identify three regimes: (i) a domain
generalization regime, where only the external model should be used, (ii) a
domain adaptation regime, where refitting the external model is optimal, and
(iii) a data-rich regime, where external data provides no additional value.

TL;DR: An AI-driven framework using LLMs automates data contract generation, reducing manual workload by 70% and ensuring scalable data governance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data contract authoring is error-prone and labor-intensive, especially as data pipelines grow in complexity.

Method: Uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, PEFT) to adapt LLMs for structured data domains, generating validated contracts from sample data or schema descriptions.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in contract generation, reducing manual workload by over 70%.

Conclusion: Generative AI bridges intent and implementation in data governance, enabling scalable and agile enterprise data management.

Abstract: Data contracts formalize agreements between data producers and consumers
regarding schema, semantics, and quality expectations. As data pipelines grow

error-prone and labor-intensive. We present an AI-driven framework for
automatic data contract generation using large language models (LLMs). Our
system leverages parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, including LoRA and
PEFT, to adapt LLMs to structured data domains. The models take sample data or
schema descriptions and output validated contract definitions in formats such
as JSON Schema and Avro. We integrate this framework into modern data platforms
(e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to automate contract enforcement at scale.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the
fine-tuned LLMs achieve high accuracy in generating valid contracts and reduce
manual workload by over 70%. We also discuss key challenges such as
hallucination, version control, and the need for continuous learning. This work
demonstrates that generative AI can enable scalable, agile data governance by
bridging the gap between intent and implementation in enterprise data
management.

### [386] [High hopes for "Deep Medicine"? AI, economics, and the future of care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21054)
*Robert Sparrow,Joshua Hatherley*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI in healthcare may not improve doctor-patient relationships as hoped; instead, it could worsen them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential negative impacts of AI on healthcare culture and doctor-patient relationships, contrasting optimistic views like Eric Topol's.

Method: Analysis of arguments and trends in AI's role in healthcare, highlighting potential downsides.

Result: AI's integration in healthcare may erode therapeutic relationships and reduce satisfaction for both doctors and patients.

Conclusion: The optimistic vision of AI enhancing empathetic care may not materialize, with risks of further distancing doctor-patient interactions.

Abstract: In the much-celebrated book Deep Medicine, Eric Topol argues that the
development of artificial intelligence for health care will lead to a dramatic
shift in the culture and practice of medicine. In the next several decades, he
suggests, AI will become sophisticated enough that many of the everyday tasks
of physicians could be delegated to it. Topol is perhaps the most articulate
advocate of the benefits of AI in medicine, but he is hardly alone in spruiking
its potential to allow physicians to dedicate more of their time and attention
to providing empathetic care for their patients in the future. Unfortunately,
several factors suggest a radically different picture for the future of health
care. Far from facilitating a return to a time of closer doctor-patient
relationships, the use of medical AI seems likely to further erode therapeutic
relationships and threaten professional and patient satisfaction.

*Anass El Ayady,Maxime Devanne,Germain Forestier,Nour El Mawas*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores using multivariate time series classification to predict at-risk learners in MOOCs, showing promising results with behavioral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low completion rates in MOOCs due to lack of personalized content necessitate predicting learner performance for tailored feedback.

Method: Comparison of multivariate time series classification methods using behavioral traces (clicks, events) to predict learner outcomes at different course stages.

Result: Preliminary results indicate the methods are effective for predicting learner failure, with accuracy influenced by interaction data volume.

Conclusion: Rich behavioral data is crucial for accurate predictions, and the evaluated methods show promise for improving MOOC completion rates.

Abstract: MOOCs offer free and open access to a wide audience, but completion rates
remain low, often due to a lack of personalized content. To address this issue,
it is essential to predict learner performance in order to provide tailored
feedback. Behavioral traces-such as clicks and events-can be analyzed as time
series to anticipate learners' outcomes. This work compares multivariate time
series classification methods to identify at-risk learners at different stages
of the course (after 5, 10 weeks, etc.). The experimental evaluation, conducted
on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), focuses on three
courses: two in STEM and one in SHS. Preliminary results show that the
evaluated approaches are promising for predicting learner failure in MOOCs. The
analysis also suggests that prediction accuracy is influenced by the amount of
recorded interactions, highlighting the importance of rich and diverse
behavioral data.

### [388] [Bridging the Gap: Enhancing News Interpretation Across Diverse Audiences with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21055)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an agent-based framework using LLMs to simulate societal communication and identify comprehension gaps in news interpretation, improving audience understanding through tailored supplementary materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address varying news interpretations due to audience expertise and age, aiming to enhance comprehension for diverse readers.

Method: An agent-based framework with LLMs simulates discussions among agents representing different expertise or age groups to identify misunderstandings and design targeted supplements.

Result: The framework accurately identifies comprehension gaps and improves news understanding for agents after receiving tailored materials.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances news comprehension by addressing specific understanding gaps for diverse audiences.

Abstract: In the interconnected world, news media are critical in conveying information
to public across diverse domains including technology, finance, and
agriculture. Journalists make efforts to present accurate information, however,
the interpretation of news often varies significantly among different audiences
due to their specific expertise and age. In this work, we investigate how to
identify these comprehension gaps and provide solutions to improve audiences
understanding of news content, particular to the aspects of articles outside
their primary domains of knowledge. We propose a agent-based framework using
large language models (LLMs) to simulate society communication behaviors, where
several agents can discuss news. These agents can be designed to be experts
from various occupation, or from different age group. Our results indicate that
this framework can identify confusions or even misunderstanding of news for the
agent through the iterative discussion process. Based on these accurate
identification, the framework can design a supplement material specific to
these agents on the news. Our results show that agents exhibit significantly
improved news understanding after receiving this material. These findings
highlight our framework's utility and efficiency in enhancing news
comprehension for diverse audiences by directly addressing their understanding
gap.

*Lenart Motnikar,Katharina Baum,Alexander Kagan,Sarah Spiekermann-Hoff*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a bottom-up approach using ISO Value-Based Engineering to align conversational agents (CAs) with human values, identifying core values and misalignments from real-world interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current top-down approaches for value alignment in CAs are often disconnected from real-world contexts, leading to misalignment with user interests.

Method: Analyzed 593 ethically sensitive outputs from 16,908 conversational logs of a European employment service CA, using ISO Value-Based Engineering's value ontology.

Result: Identified nine core values and 32 instances of value misalignment negatively impacting users.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable insights for CA providers to improve ethical interactions and context-sensitive value alignment.

Abstract: Conversational agents (CAs) based on generative artificial intelligence
frequently face challenges ensuring ethical interactions that align with human
values. Current value alignment efforts largely rely on top-down approaches,
such as technical guidelines or legal value principles. However, these methods
tend to be disconnected from the specific contexts in which CAs operate,
potentially leading to misalignment with users interests. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel, bottom-up approach to value alignment, utilizing
the value ontology of the ISO Value-Based Engineering standard for ethical IT
design. We analyse 593 ethically sensitive system outputs identified from
16,908 conversational logs of a major European employment service CA to
identify core values and instances of value misalignment within real-world
interactions. The results revealed nine core values and 32 different value
misalignments that negatively impacted users. Our findings provide actionable
insights for CA providers seeking to address ethical challenges and achieve
more context-sensitive value alignment.

TL;DR: TACTIC-GRAPHS combines spectral graph theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for threat detection in tactical video, achieving high accuracy in temporal alignment and threat recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address semantic understanding and threat detection in noisy, weakly structured tactical video by leveraging multimodal data.

Method: Uses spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, discriminative path inference, and semantic-aware keyframe extraction with graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping.

Result: Achieves 89.3% accuracy in temporal alignment and over 85% threat chain recognition with low node latency.

Conclusion: The framework improves structural interpretability and is applicable to surveillance, defense, and security systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces TACTIC-GRAPHS, a system that combines spectral graph
theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and
threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The
framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and
discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware
keyframe extraction method fuses visual, acoustic, and action cues to construct
temporal graphs. Using graph attention and Laplacian spectral mapping, the
model performs cross-modal weighting and causal signal analysis. Experiments on
TACTIC-AVS and TACTIC-Voice datasets show 89.3 percent accuracy in temporal
alignment and over 85 percent recognition of complete threat chains, with node
latency within plus-minus 150 milliseconds. The approach enhances structural
interpretability and supports applications in surveillance, defense, and
intelligent security systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper highlights the lack of concrete ecological impact assessments for AI, especially LLMs and genAI, and proposes integrating philosophical insights for practical sustainability analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing environmental concerns about AI's ecological impact, particularly LLMs and genAI, with limited developer transparency.

Method: Encourages practical sustainability analyses of genAI, informed by philosophical perspectives.

Result: Identifies gaps in current ecological impact assessments, often limited to greenhouse gas emissions.

Conclusion: Proposes a framework combining philosophical ideas with practical sustainability evaluations for genAI.

Abstract: Philosophers of technology have recently started paying more attention to the
environmental impacts of AI, in particular of large language models (LLMs) and
generative AI (genAI) applications. Meanwhile, few developers of AI give
concrete estimates of the ecological impact of their models and products, and
even when they do so, their analysis is often limited to green house gas
emissions of certain stages of AI development or use. The current proposal
encourages practically viable analyses of the sustainability aspects of genAI
informed by philosophical ideas.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper examines socio-technical challenges in AI adoption, focusing on trust in AI tools in safety-critical domains like air traffic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in literature on trust requirements for AI in organizational settings, especially in safety-critical work.

Method: Ethnographic study of air traffic control work practices to understand trust issues with current tools.

Result: Reveals insights into requirements for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to consider practical trust challenges in AI adoption for critical applications.

Abstract: Exploring the socio-technical challenges confronting the adoption of AI in
organisational settings is something that has so far been largely absent from
the related literature. In particular, research into requirements for
trustworthy AI typically overlooks how people deal with the problems of trust
in the tools that they use as part of their everyday work practices. This
article presents some findings from an ongoing ethnographic study of how
current tools are used in air traffic control work and what it reveals about
requirements for trustworthy AI in air traffic control and other

bringing significant efficiency to businesses and offering distinctive user
experiences. In this paper, we focus on exploring the application of ChatGPT, a
chatbot based on a large language model, to support higher educator in
generating quiz questions and assessing learners. Specifically, we explore

### [394] [Against racing to AGI: Cooperation, deterrence, and catastrophic risks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21839)
*Leonard Dung,Max Hellrigel-Holderbaum*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper argues against AGI Racing, highlighting its high risks and questionable benefits, and advocates for international cooperation as a safer alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the notion that accelerating AGI development is beneficial, emphasizing its potential catastrophic risks and undermining of AI safety research.

Method: Analyzes the downsides of AGI Racing, questions its expected benefits, and proposes international cooperation as a better alternative.

Result: AGI Racing increases catastrophic risks and may not deliver its promised benefits, making cooperation preferable.

Conclusion: Racing to AGI is not in anyone's self-interest; international cooperation is a safer and more effective approach.

Abstract: AGI Racing is the view that it is in the self-interest of major actors in AI
development, especially powerful nations, to accelerate their frontier AI
development to build highly capable AI, especially artificial general
intelligence (AGI), before competitors have a chance. We argue against AGI
Racing. First, the downsides of racing to AGI are much higher than portrayed by
this view. Racing to AGI would substantially increase catastrophic risks from
AI, including nuclear instability, and undermine the prospects of technical AI
safety research to be effective. Second, the expected benefits of racing may be
lower than proponents of AGI Racing hold. In particular, it is questionable
whether winning the race enables complete domination over losers. Third,
international cooperation and coordination, and perhaps carefully crafted
deterrence measures, constitute viable alternatives to racing to AGI which have
much smaller risks and promise to deliver most of the benefits that racing to
AGI is supposed to provide. Hence, racing to AGI is not in anyone's
self-interest as other actions, particularly incentivizing and seeking
international cooperation around AI issues, are preferable.

*Matthijs Mars,Tobías I. Liaudat,Jessica J. Whitney,Marta M. Betcke,Jason D. McEwen*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: The paper introduces RI-GAN, a generative neural network framework for efficient, high-quality image reconstruction with uncertainty quantification in radio astronomy, addressing computational inefficiencies of traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for computationally efficient image reconstruction techniques for large radio telescopes like SKA, as existing methods (e.g., CLEAN) are iterative, computationally expensive, and lack uncertainty quantification.

Method: RI-GAN combines a gradient U-Net (GU-Net) architecture with Wasserstein GANs and regularization terms to embed the measurement operator directly into the network, improving stability and combating mode collapse.

Result: RI-GAN provides robust, high-quality reconstructions, handles varying visibility coverages, generalizes to high dynamic range images, and offers informative uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: RI-GAN advances computationally efficient, scalable, and uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

Abstract: With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the
SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image
reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN
algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,
necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no
uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.
Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and
high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative
neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior
distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.
Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative
adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)
architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement
operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to
improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat
mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach
takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the
observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are
robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased
dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods
provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and
uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.

*Agastya Raj,Zehao Wang,Tingjun Chen,Daniel C Kilper,Marco Ruffini*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: A generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture using SS-NN improves gain spectrum prediction in EDFAs, reducing measurement needs and errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate gain spectrum modeling is crucial for optimizing multi-vendor optical networks.

Method: Proposes a Semi-Supervised Self-Normalizing Neural Network with unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, extended with transfer learning for homogeneous and heterogeneous adaptation.

Result: Reduces measurement requirements and achieves lower mean absolute errors compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The SS-NN with transfer learning effectively enhances EDFA gain spectrum prediction.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the gain spectrum in Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers
(EDFAs) is essential for optimizing optical network performance, particularly
as networks evolve toward multi-vendor solutions. In this work, we propose a
generalized few-shot transfer learning architecture based on a Semi-Supervised
Self-Normalizing Neural Network (SS-NN) that leverages internal EDFA features -
such as VOA input or output power and attenuation, to improve gain spectrum
prediction. Our SS-NN model employs a two-phase training strategy comprising
unsupervised pre-training with noise-augmented measurements and supervised
fine-tuning with a custom weighted MSE loss. Furthermore, we extend the
framework with transfer learning (TL) techniques that enable both homogeneous
(same-feature space) and heterogeneous (different-feature sets) model
adaptation across booster, preamplifier, and ILA EDFAs. To address feature
mismatches in heterogeneous TL, we incorporate a covariance matching loss to
align second-order feature statistics between source and target domains.
Extensive experiments conducted across 26 EDFAs in the COSMOS and Open Ireland
testbeds demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
number of measurements requirements on the system while achieving lower mean
absolute errors and improved error distributions compared to benchmark methods.

### [398] [Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Cell DTX/DRX Configuration for Network Energy Saving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21385)
*Wei Mao,Lili Wei,Omid Semiari,Shu-ping Yeh,Hosein Nikopour*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper explores optimizing 5G cell DTX/DRX for energy savings and minimal QoS degradation using deep reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance energy saving and packet delay in 5G networks, especially for delay-sensitive traffic.

Method: Uses deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit model with a smooth reward function approximation.

Result: Achieves up to ~45% energy saving with ≤1% QoS degradation.

Conclusion: DRL effectively optimizes cell DTX/DRX for varying network conditions.

Abstract: 3GPP Release 18 cell discontinuous transmission and reception (cell DTX/DRX)
is an important new network energy saving feature for 5G. As a time-domain
technique, it periodically aggregates the user data transmissions in a given
duration of time when the traffic load is not heavy, so that the remaining time
can be kept silent and advanced sleep modes (ASM) can be enabled to shut down
more radio components and save more energy for the cell. However, inevitably
the packet delay is increased, as during the silent period no transmission is
allowed. In this paper we study how to configure cell DTX/DRX to optimally
balance energy saving and packet delay, so that for delay-sensitive traffic
maximum energy saving can be achieved while the degradation of quality of
service (QoS) is minimized. As the optimal configuration can be different for
different network and traffic conditions, the problem is complex and we resort
to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to train an AI agent to solve
it. Through careful design of 1) the learning algorithm, which implements a
deep Q-network (DQN) on a contextual bandit (CB) model, and 2) the reward
function, which utilizes a smooth approximation of a theoretically optimal but
discontinuous reward function, we are able to train an AI agent that always
tries to select the best possible Cell DTX/DRX configuration under any network
and traffic conditions. Simulation results show that compared to the case when
cell DTX/DRX is not used, our agent can achieve up to ~45% energy saving
depending on the traffic load scenario, while always maintaining no more than
~1% QoS degradation.

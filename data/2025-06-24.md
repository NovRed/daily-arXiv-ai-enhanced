### [1] [Mechanistic Interpretability of Diffusion Models: Circuit-Level Analysis and Causal Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17237)
*Dip Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes diffusion models at the circuit level, revealing differences in processing synthetic vs. natural data, identifying specialized attention mechanisms, and demonstrating performance impacts of targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational pathways and mechanistic principles behind image generation in diffusion models, particularly for synthetic vs. naturalistic data.

Method: Conducted systematic intervention experiments on 2,000 synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, measuring computational complexity and attention patterns.

Result: Found higher complexity for real-world face processing (ratio = 1.084 Â± 0.008) and identified eight specialized attention mechanisms (e.g., edge detection, texture analysis). Targeted ablations caused 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation.

Conclusion: The study provides quantitative insights into diffusion model behavior, enabling better algorithmic understanding and control through mechanistic interventions.

Abstract: We present a quantitative circuit-level analysis of diffusion models,
establishing computational pathways and mechanistic principles underlying image
generation processes. Through systematic intervention experiments across 2,000
synthetic and 2,000 CelebA facial images, we discover fundamental algorithmic
differences in how diffusion architectures process synthetic versus
naturalistic data distributions. Our investigation reveals that real-world face
processing requires circuits with measurably higher computational complexity
(complexity ratio = 1.084 plus/minus 0.008, p < 0.001), exhibiting distinct
attention specialization patterns with entropy divergence ranging from 0.015 to
0.166 across denoising timesteps. We identify eight functionally distinct
attention mechanisms showing specialized computational roles: edge detection
(entropy = 3.18 plus/minus 0.12), texture analysis (entropy = 4.16 plus/minus
0.08), and semantic understanding (entropy = 2.67 plus/minus 0.15).
Intervention analysis demonstrates critical computational bottlenecks where
targeted ablations produce 25.6% to 128.3% performance degradation, providing
causal evidence for identified circuit functions. These findings establish
quantitative foundations for algorithmic understanding and control of
generative model behavior through mechanistic intervention strategies.

### [2] [SRKD: Towards Efficient 3D Point Cloud Segmentation via Structure- and Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17290)
*Yuqi Li,Junhao Dong,Zeyu Dong,Chuanguang Yang,Zhulin An,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SRKD, a knowledge distillation framework for 3D point cloud segmentation, transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a lightweight student model using affinity matrix-based relation alignment and cross-sample mini-batch construction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses computational complexity and deployment limitations of large transformer-based models in 3D point cloud segmentation.

Method: Uses affinity matrix-based relation alignment for structural dependencies, cross-sample mini-batch construction for generalized geometric structure, and KL divergence for semantic alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced model complexity (<15M parameters).

Conclusion: SRKD is effective and efficient for real-world deployment in 3D point cloud segmentation.

Abstract: 3D point cloud segmentation faces practical challenges due to the
computational complexity and deployment limitations of large-scale
transformer-based models. To address this, we propose a novel Structure- and
Relation-aware Knowledge Distillation framework, named SRKD, that transfers
rich geometric and semantic knowledge from a large frozen teacher model (>100M)
to a lightweight student model (<15M). Specifically, we propose an affinity
matrix-based relation alignment module, which distills structural dependencies
from the teacher to the student through point-wise similarity matching,
enhancing the student's capability to learn contextual interactions. Meanwhile,
we introduce a cross-sample mini-batch construction strategy that enables the
student to perceive stable and generalized geometric structure. This aligns
across diverse point cloud instances of the teacher, rather than within a
single sample. Additionally, KL divergence is applied to align semantic
distributions, and ground-truth supervision further reinforces accurate
segmentation. Our method achieves state of the art performance with
significantly reduced model complexity, demonstrating its effectiveness and
efficiency in real-world deployment scenarios. Our Code is available at

### [3] [Fine-Scale Soil Mapping in Alaska with Multimodal Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17302)
*Yijun Lin,Theresa Chen,Colby Brungard,Grunwald Sabine,Sue Ives,Matt Macander,Timm Nawrocki,Yao-Yi Chiang,Nic Jelinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MISO, a vision-based ML model, outperforms Random Forest in fine-scale soil mapping for permafrost in Alaska, offering better generalization and recall for monitoring thaw and informing adaptation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-scale soil mapping is crucial for understanding permafrost distribution and its impacts due to climate change, but traditional methods are limited.

Method: MISO combines a geospatial foundation model, implicit neural representations, and contrastive learning for continuous spatial prediction and multimodal alignment.

Result: MISO generalizes better to unseen locations and achieves higher recall than Random Forest, particularly in permafrost zones and MLRAs.

Conclusion: Advanced ML like MISO holds promise for improving soil mapping and guiding future sampling and planning in permafrost landscapes.

Abstract: Fine-scale soil mapping in Alaska, traditionally relying on fieldwork and
localized simulations, remains a critical yet underdeveloped task, despite the
region's ecological importance and extensive permafrost coverage. As permafrost
thaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability
and key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil
maps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying
vulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies. We present MISO, a
vision-based machine learning (ML) model to produce statewide fine-scale soil
maps for near-surface permafrost and soil taxonomy. The model integrates a
geospatial foundation model for visual feature extraction, implicit neural
representations for continuous spatial prediction, and contrastive learning for
multimodal alignment and geo-location awareness. We compare MISO with Random
Forest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping
applications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost
Zones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better
to remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is
critical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.
These findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for
fine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling
and infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes. The project will
be released at https://github.com/knowledge-computing/Peatland-permafrost.

### [4] [RadarSeq: A Temporal Vision Framework for User Churn Prediction via Radar Chart Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17325)
*Sina Najafi,M. Hadi Sepanj,Fahimeh Jafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A temporally-aware computer vision framework using radar chart sequences and a CNN-LSTM model improves churn prediction in gig platforms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting user churn in gig platforms is challenging due to implicit disengagement and lack of explicit labels. Existing methods miss temporal cues.

Method: Proposes a framework modeling user behavior as radar chart sequences, combining a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM for spatial-temporal pattern capture.

Result: Outperforms classical models and ViT-based baselines, achieving gains of 17.7 in F1, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, with better interpretability.

Conclusion: The modular, explainable, and efficient framework is effective for large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig platforms.

Abstract: Predicting user churn in non-subscription gig platforms, where disengagement
is implicit, poses unique challenges due to the absence of explicit labels and
the dynamic nature of user behavior. Existing methods often rely on aggregated
snapshots or static visual representations, which obscure temporal cues
critical for early detection. In this work, we propose a temporally-aware
computer vision framework that models user behavioral patterns as a sequence of
radar chart images, each encoding day-level behavioral features. By integrating
a pretrained CNN encoder with a bidirectional LSTM, our architecture captures
both spatial and temporal patterns underlying churn behavior. Extensive
experiments on a large real-world dataset demonstrate that our method
outperforms classical models and ViT-based radar chart baselines, yielding
gains of 17.7 in F1 score, 29.4 in precision, and 16.1 in AUC, along with
improved interpretability. The framework's modular design, explainability
tools, and efficient deployment characteristics make it suitable for
large-scale churn modeling in dynamic gig-economy platforms.

### [5] [P2MFDS: A Privacy-Preserving Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17332)
*Haitian Wang,Yiren Wang,Xinyu Wang,Yumeng Miao,Yuliang Zhang,Yu Zhang,Atif Mansoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving multimodal fall detection system (P2MFDS) for elderly in bathrooms combines radar and vibration sensing, outperforming unimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high fall risk for elderly in bathrooms and limitations of unimodal sensing systems.

Method: Develops a sensor fusion framework (radar + vibration), creates a dataset, and introduces P2MFDS, a dual-stream network for fall detection.

Result: P2MFDS achieves higher accuracy and recall than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively improves fall detection in complex bathroom environments while preserving privacy.

Abstract: By 2050, people aged 65 and over are projected to make up 16 percent of the
global population. As aging is closely associated with increased fall risk,
particularly in wet and confined environments such as bathrooms where over 80
percent of falls occur. Although recent research has increasingly focused on
non-intrusive, privacy-preserving approaches that do not rely on wearable
devices or video-based monitoring, these efforts have not fully overcome the
limitations of existing unimodal systems (e.g., WiFi-, infrared-, or
mmWave-based), which are prone to reduced accuracy in complex environments.
These limitations stem from fundamental constraints in unimodal sensing,
including system bias and environmental interference, such as multipath fading
in WiFi-based systems and drastic temperature changes in infrared-based
methods. To address these challenges, we propose a Privacy-Preserving
Multimodal Fall Detection System for Elderly People in Bathroom Environments.
First, we develop a sensor evaluation framework to select and fuse
millimeter-wave radar with 3D vibration sensing, and use it to construct and
preprocess a large-scale, privacy-preserving multimodal dataset in real
bathroom settings, which will be released upon publication. Second, we
introduce P2MFDS, a dual-stream network combining a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention branch
for radar motion dynamics with a multi-scale CNN-SEBlock-Self-Attention branch
for vibration impact detection. By uniting macro- and micro-scale features,
P2MFDS delivers significant gains in accuracy and recall over state-of-the-art
approaches. Code and pretrained models will be made available at:

### [6] [A Novel Multi-layer Task-centric and Data Quality Framework for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17346)
*Yuhan Zhou,Haihua Chen,Kewei Sha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a task-centric, data quality-aware framework for next-gen autonomous vehicles (AVs) to address overlooked data quality (DQ) issues, mapping DQ to task requirements and performance goals. A case study on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates improved object detection by managing redundancy in multisource data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AV research and practice focus heavily on models/algorithms while undervaluing data quality (DQ), which is critical for functionality, efficiency, and trustworthiness in dynamic environments.

Method: A five-layer framework (data, DQ, task, application, goal) is introduced to align DQ with task performance. A case study on the nuScenes dataset evaluates redundancy in multisource image and LiDAR data.

Result: Partial removal of redundancy in multisource image data improves YOLOv8 object detection performance. Redundancy DQ issues are identified in multimodal data.

Conclusion: The framework addresses unexplored challenges in DQ, task orchestration, and performance-oriented AV development, guiding the community toward more adaptive and resilient AV systems.

Abstract: The next-generation autonomous vehicles (AVs), embedded with frequent
real-time decision-making, will rely heavily on a large volume of multisource
and multimodal data. In real-world settings, the data quality (DQ) of different
sources and modalities usually varies due to unexpected environmental factors
or sensor issues. However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field
overwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To
fulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,
efficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and
data quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ
layer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework
aims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a
case study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that
partially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8
object detection task performance. Analysis on multimodal data of image and
LiDAR further presents existing redundancy DQ issues. This paper opens up a
range of critical but unexplored challenges at the intersection of DQ, task
orchestration, and performance-oriented system development in AVs. It is
expected to guide the AV community toward building more adaptive, explainable,
and resilient AVs that respond intelligently to dynamic environments and
heterogeneous data streams. Code, data, and implementation details are publicly
available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/dq4av-framework/README.md.

### [7] [Efficient Feedback Gate Network for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17361)
*Xufei Wang,Mingjian Zhang,Fei Ge,Jinchen Zhu,Wen Sha,Jifen Ren,Zhimeng Hou,Shouguo Zheng,ling Zheng,Shizhuang Weng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel group-based SHSR method, the efficient feedback gate network, improves hyperspectral image resolution by leveraging feedbacks, gate operations, and spatial-spectral reinforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SHSR methods underperform due to insufficient exploration of band coherence and spatial-spectral information.

Method: Proposes an efficient feedback gate network with SPDFM for band information and SSRGM for spatial-spectral features, using 3D SSRGM for holistic enhancement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spectral fidelity and spatial content reconstruction on three datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances hyperspectral image resolution by better leveraging spatial-spectral coherence.

Abstract: Even without auxiliary images, single hyperspectral image super-resolution
(SHSR) methods can be designed to improve the spatial resolution of
hyperspectral images. However, failing to explore coherence thoroughly along
bands and spatial-spectral information leads to the limited performance of the
SHSR. In this study, we propose a novel group-based SHSR method termed the
efficient feedback gate network, which uses various feedbacks and gate
operations involving large kernel convolutions and spectral interactions. In
particular, by providing different guidance for neighboring groups, we can
learn rich band information and hierarchical hyperspectral spatial information
using channel shuffling and dilatation convolution in shuffled and progressive
dilated fusion module(SPDFM). Moreover, we develop a wide-bound perception gate
block and a spectrum enhancement gate block to construct the spatial-spectral
reinforcement gate module (SSRGM) and obtain highly representative
spatial-spectral features efficiently. Additionally, we apply a
three-dimensional SSRGM to enhance holistic information and coherence for
hyperspectral data. The experimental results on three hyperspectral datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed network over the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of spectral fidelity and spatial content
reconstruction.

### [8] [From Drawings to Decisions: A Hybrid Vision-Language Framework for Parsing 2D Engineering Drawings into Structured Manufacturing Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17374)
*Muhammad Tayyab Khan,Lequn Chen,Zane Yong,Jun Ming Tan,Wenhe Feng,Seung Ki Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid vision-language framework for extracting key information from 2D engineering drawings, combining rotation-aware object detection (YOLOv11-OBB) with transformer-based vision-language parsing (Donut and Florence-2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is slow and error-prone, while generic OCR models struggle with complex layouts and symbols.

Method: Proposes a pipeline using YOLOv11-OBB for localization and extraction of oriented bounding boxes, followed by parsing with fine-tuned VLMs (Donut and Florence-2).

Result: Donut outperforms Florence-2 with 88.5% precision, 99.2% recall, and 93.5% F1-score, demonstrating high accuracy in parsing structured outputs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively modernizes 2D drawing interpretation, supporting downstream manufacturing tasks with reliable structured data extraction.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering
drawings is essential for advancing digital manufacturing workflows. Such
information includes geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), measures,
material specifications, and textual annotations. Manual extraction is slow and
labor-intensive, while generic OCR models often fail due to complex layouts,
engineering symbols, and rotated text, leading to incomplete and unreliable
outputs. These limitations result in incomplete and unreliable outputs. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid vision-language framework that
integrates a rotation-aware object detection model (YOLOv11-obb) with a
transformer-based vision-language parser. Our structured pipeline applies
YOLOv11-OBB to localize annotations and extract oriented bounding box (OBB)
patches, which are then parsed into structured outputs using a fine-tuned,
lightweight vision-language model (VLM). We curate a dataset of 1,367 2D
mechanical drawings annotated across nine key categories. YOLOv11-OBB is
trained on this dataset to detect OBBs and extract annotation patches. These
are parsed using two open-source VLMs: Donut and Florence-2. Both models are
lightweight and well-suited for specialized industrial tasks under limited
computational overhead. Following fine-tuning of both models on the curated
dataset of image patches paired with structured annotation labels, a
comparative experiment is conducted to evaluate parsing performance across four
key metrics. Donut outperforms Florence-2, achieving 88.5% precision, 99.2%
recall, and a 93.5% F1-score, with a hallucination rate of 11.5%. Finally, a
case study demonstrates how the extracted structured information supports
downstream manufacturing tasks such as process and tool selection, showcasing
the practical utility of the proposed framework in modernizing 2D drawing
interpretation.

### [9] [Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training for Embryo Viability Prediction Using Time-Lapse Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17403)
*Zhiyi Shi,Junsik Kim,Helen Y. Yang,Yonghyun Song,Hyun-Jic Oh,Dalit Ben-Yosef,Daniel Needleman,Hanspeter Pfister*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) for automating embryo viability prediction in IVF, addressing challenges like long videos and temporal misalignment with a two-stage SSL method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating embryo viability prediction is crucial for IVF but hindered by limited labeled data and challenges in handling long, variable-length embryo videos.

Method: STPT uses a two-stage SSL approach: spatial (learning within videos) and temporal (modeling relationships between videos), avoiding frame-by-frame alignment to save memory and handle variability.

Result: STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 on 23,027 videos (3,286 labeled), outperforming baselines with limited resources.

Conclusion: STPT effectively addresses challenges in embryo video analysis, improving viability prediction with efficient resource use.

Abstract: Automating embryo viability prediction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) is
important but challenging due to the limited availability of labeled pregnancy
outcome data, as only a small fraction of embryos are labeled after transfer.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to
improve prediction. However, existing SSL methods for videos are not directly
applicable to embryo development videos due to two challenges: (1) embryo
time-lapse videos contain hundreds of frames, requiring significant GPU memory
for conventional SSL; (2) the dataset contains videos with varying lengths and
many outlier frames, causing traditional video alignment methods to struggle
with semantic misalignment. We propose Spatial-Temporal Pre-Training (STPT) to
address these challenges. STPT includes two stages: spatial and temporal. In
each stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing
memory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame
alignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each
video and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then
models relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles
long videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286
labeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared
to baselines, with limited computational resources.

### [10] [VMRA-MaR: An Asymmetry-Aware Temporal Framework for Longitudinal Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17412)
*Zijun Sun,Solveig Thrun,Michael Kampffmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with state-space modeling and LSTM-like memory to improve breast cancer risk prediction by capturing temporal trends in longitudinal imaging data, enhanced by an asymmetry module for bilateral differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer detection relies on screening programs, and current models often miss temporal dynamics in breast tissue evolution. The goal is to improve risk prediction by leveraging longitudinal data and addressing high-density breast cases.

Method: The approach combines VMRNN with state-space modeling and LSTM-like memory to capture temporal trends. An asymmetry module (SAD and LAT) identifies bilateral differences for better clinical relevance.

Result: The framework improves cancer onset prediction, especially for high-density breasts, and excels at extended time points (years four and five).

Conclusion: The method advances early breast cancer recognition and enables personalized screening strategies, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is typically
detected via screening programs where healthy people are invited in regular
intervals. Automated risk prediction approaches have the potential to improve
this process by facilitating dynamically screening of high-risk groups. While
most models focus solely on the most recent screening, there is growing
interest in exploiting temporal information to capture evolving trends in
breast tissue, as inspired by clinical practice. Early methods typically relied
on two time steps, and although recent efforts have extended this to multiple
time steps using Transformer architectures, challenges remain in fully
harnessing the rich temporal dynamics inherent in longitudinal imaging data. In
this work, we propose to instead leverage Vision Mamba RNN (VMRNN) with a
state-space model (SSM) and LSTM-like memory mechanisms to effectively capture
nuanced trends in breast tissue evolution. To further enhance our approach, we
incorporate an asymmetry module that utilizes a Spatial Asymmetry Detector
(SAD) and Longitudinal Asymmetry Tracker (LAT) to identify clinically relevant
bilateral differences. This integrated framework demonstrates notable
improvements in predicting cancer onset, especially for the more challenging
high-density breast cases and achieves superior performance at extended time
points (years four and five), highlighting its potential to advance early
breast cancer recognition and enable more personalized screening strategies.

### [11] [Trans${^2}$-CBCT: A Dual-Transformer Framework for Sparse-View CBCT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17425)
*Minmin Yang,Huantao Ren,Senem Velipasalar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Trans-CBCT and Trans$^2$-CBCT, hybrid CNN-Transformer models for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction, outperforming baselines in PSNR and SSIM metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing severe artifacts and poor spatial coverage in CBCT due to under-sampling from few X-ray projection views.

Method: Replacing UNet/ResNet with TransUNet for local-global feature fusion, adding attenuation-prediction, and introducing neighbor-aware Point Transformer for volumetric coherence.

Result: Trans-CBCT improves PSNR by 1.17 dB and SSIM by 0.0163; Trans$^2$-CBCT adds 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM.

Conclusion: Combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based geometry reasoning effectively enhances sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using only a few X-ray projection views
enables faster scans with lower radiation dose, but the resulting severe
under-sampling causes strong artifacts and poor spatial coverage. We address
these challenges in a unified framework. First, we replace conventional
UNet/ResNet encoders with TransUNet, a hybrid CNN-Transformer model.
Convolutional layers capture local details, while self-attention layers enhance
global context. We adapt TransUNet to CBCT by combining multi-scale features,
querying view-specific features per 3D point, and adding a lightweight
attenuation-prediction head. This yields Trans-CBCT, which surpasses prior
baselines by 1.17 dB PSNR and 0.0163 SSIM on the LUNA16 dataset with six views.
Second, we introduce a neighbor-aware Point Transformer to enforce volumetric
coherence. This module uses 3D positional encoding and attention over k-nearest
neighbors to improve spatial consistency. The resulting model, Trans$^2$-CBCT,
provides an additional gain of 0.63 dB PSNR and 0.0117 SSIM. Experiments on
LUNA16 and ToothFairy show consistent gains from six to ten views, validating
the effectiveness of combining CNN-Transformer features with point-based
geometry reasoning for sparse-view CBCT reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hybrid deep learning model (CNN-Bi-GRU) for identifying RF devices using transient energy spectrum analysis, achieving high accuracy (99.17%) and demonstrating its potential for complex wireless environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential increase in radiation devices in complex electromagnetic environments necessitates accurate identification and classification, which existing methods struggle to address.

Method: The approach uses General Linear Chirplet Transform for feature extraction and a CNN-Bi-GRU model for classification, tested on a dataset of nine RF devices.

Result: The model achieved 99.33% precision, 99.53% recall, 99.43% F1-score, and 99.17% accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation.

Conclusion: The CNN-Bi-GRU model is effective for RF device identification, offering a reliable solution for complex wireless environments.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid growth of the Internet of Things technologies and
the widespread adoption of 5G wireless networks have led to an exponential
increase in the number of radiation devices operating in complex
electromagnetic environments. A key challenge in managing and securing these
devices is accurate identification and classification. To address this
challenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a
promising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of
identifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.
This research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum
analysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from
RF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample
containing 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples
across the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling
framework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning
methods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for
learning the identification of RF devices based on their transient
characteristics. The proposed approach provided a 10-fold cross-validation
performance with a precision of 99.33%, recall of 99.53%, F1-score of 99.43%,
and classification accuracy of 99.17%. The results demonstrate the promising
classification performance of the CNN-Bi-GRU approach, indicating its
suitability for accurately identifying RF devices based on their transient
characteristics and its potential for enhancing device identification and
classification in complex wireless environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like turbidity, low illumination, and occlusion in underwater visual recognition.

Method: Evaluated 13 deep learning models on AQUA20 dataset (8,171 images, 20 species) using metrics like Top-1/3 accuracy and F1-score.

Result: ConvNeXt performed best (Top-3: 98.82%, Top-1: 90.69%, F1: 88.92%). Other models showed complexity-performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: AQUA20 is a valuable resource for future research, with room for improvement in underwater species recognition.

Abstract: Robust visual recognition in underwater environments remains a significant
challenge due to complex distortions such as turbidity, low illumination, and
occlusion, which severely degrade the performance of standard vision systems.
This paper introduces AQUA20, a comprehensive benchmark dataset comprising
8,171 underwater images across 20 marine species reflecting real-world
environmental challenges such as illumination, turbidity, occlusions, etc.,
providing a valuable resource for underwater visual understanding. Thirteen
state-of-the-art deep learning models, including lightweight CNNs (SqueezeNet,
MobileNetV2) and transformer-based architectures (ViT, ConvNeXt), were
evaluated to benchmark their performance in classifying marine species under
challenging conditions. Our experimental results show ConvNeXt achieving the
best performance, with a Top-3 accuracy of 98.82% and a Top-1 accuracy of
90.69%, as well as the highest overall F1-score of 88.92% with moderately large
parameter size. The results obtained from our other benchmark models also
demonstrate trade-offs between complexity and performance. We also provide an
extensive explainability analysis using GRAD-CAM and LIME for interpreting the
strengths and pitfalls of the models. Our results reveal substantial room for
improvement in underwater species recognition and demonstrate the value of
AQUA20 as a foundation for future research in this domain. The dataset is
publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/taufiktrf/AQUA20.

*Dong Xiao,Guangyao Chen,Peixi Peng,Yangru Huang,Yifan Zhao,Yongxing Dai,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time anomaly detection method for autonomous driving using a multimodal asynchronous hybrid network combining event and RGB camera data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in current anomaly detection methods by prioritizing both response time and accuracy, critical for autonomous driving safety.

Method: Introduces a novel multimodal asynchronous hybrid network: an asynchronous Graph Neural Network for event camera data and a CNN for RGB images.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and response time, achieving millisecond-level real-time performance.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines temporal dynamics and spatial details for swift, precise anomaly detection in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is essential for the safety and reliability of autonomous
driving systems. Current methods often focus on detection accuracy but neglect
response time, which is critical in time-sensitive driving scenarios. In this
paper, we introduce real-time anomaly detection for autonomous driving,
prioritizing both minimal response time and high accuracy. We propose a novel
multimodal asynchronous hybrid network that combines event streams from event
cameras with image data from RGB cameras. Our network utilizes the high
temporal resolution of event cameras through an asynchronous Graph Neural
Network and integrates it with spatial features extracted by a CNN from RGB
images. This combination effectively captures both the temporal dynamics and
spatial details of the driving environment, enabling swift and precise anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach
outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and response time, achieving
millisecond-level real-time performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a high-resolution image dataset of soil samples for training CNNs to improve PSD analysis efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PSD analyses are costly and time-consuming; optical grain size analysis integrated into workflows could mitigate these issues.

Method: A standardized setup with 45 MP resolution images of moist and dry soil samples, using a custom test bench and coning/quartering for larger samples.

Result: A dataset of 12,714 images of 321 soil samples from Montreal, suitable for CNN training in geotechnical applications.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a foundation for developing efficient, automated PSD analysis methods using CNNs.

Abstract: Traditional particle size distribution (PSD) analyses create significant
downtime and are expensive in labor and maintenance. These drawbacks could be
alleviated using optical grain size analysis integrated into routine
geotechnical laboratory workflow. This paper presents a high-resolution dataset
of 12,714 images of 321 different soil samples collected in the Montreal,
Quebec region, alongside their PSD analysis. It is designed to provide a robust
starting point for training convolutional neural networks (CNN) in geotechnical
applications. Soil samples were photographed in a standardized top-view
position with a resolution of 45 MP and a minimum scale of 39.4 micrometers per
pixel, both in their moist and dry states. A custom test bench employing 13x9
inch white aluminum trays, on which the samples are spread in a thin layer, was
used. For samples exceeding a size limit, a coning and quartering method was
employed for mass reduction.

*Julio Silva-RodrÃ­guez,Fereshteh Shakeri,Houda Bahig,Jose Dolz,Ismail Ben Ayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques assumptions in vision-language models (VLMs) for medical image analysis, introduces a realistic imbalanced and validation-free adaptation setting, and proposes a training-free linear probe for robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs make unrealistic assumptions about balanced data and validation sets, which don't align with real-world medical scenarios.

Method: Introduces a realistic adaptation setting and a training-free linear probe blending visual and textual supervision.

Result: Current methods underperform in realistic conditions; the proposed solver provides robust adaptation.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for realistic assumptions in VLMs and offers an efficient baseline for adaptation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are gaining attention in medical image
analysis. These are pre-trained on large, heterogeneous data sources, yielding
rich and transferable representations. Notably, the combination of
modality-specialized VLMs with few-shot adaptation has provided fruitful
results, enabling the efficient deployment of high-performing solutions.
However, previous works on this topic make strong assumptions about the
distribution of adaptation data, which are unrealistic in the medical domain.
First, prior art assumes access to a balanced support set, a condition that
breaks the natural imbalance in disease prevalence found in real-world
scenarios. Second, these works typically assume the presence of an additional
validation set to fix critical hyper-parameters, which is highly
data-inefficient. This work challenges these favorable deployment scenarios and
introduces a realistic, imbalanced, validation-free adaptation setting. Our
extensive benchmark across various modalities and downstream tasks demonstrates
that current methods systematically compromise their performance when operating
under realistic conditions, occasionally even performing worse than zero-shot
inference. Also, we introduce a training-free linear probe that adaptively
blends visual and textual supervision. Detailed studies demonstrate that the
proposed solver is a strong, efficient baseline, enabling robust adaptation in
challenging scenarios.

*Julio Silva-RodrÃ­guez,Ismail Ben Ayed,Jose Dolz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel pipeline, SCA-T, to improve the reliability of medical vision-language models (VLMs) in conformal prediction by addressing the limitations of traditional split conformal prediction (SCP) when adapting pre-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reliability of medical VLMs, despite their growing use, remains underexplored. The work aims to provide trustworthiness guarantees for these models when transferred to specific tasks.

Method: The proposed transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T) pipeline performs unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data, addressing the exchangeability issue in SCP.

Result: SCA-T consistently improves efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP while maintaining empirical guarantees, as demonstrated across various medical image modalities and tasks.

Conclusion: SCA-T offers a robust solution for reliable transfer learning in conformal prediction scenarios, enhancing the trustworthiness of medical VLMs.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented
transfer capabilities and are being increasingly adopted for data-efficient
image classification. Despite its growing popularity, its reliability aspect
remains largely unexplored. This work explores the split conformal prediction
(SCP) framework to provide trustworthiness guarantees when transferring such
models based on a small labeled calibration set. Despite its potential, the
generalist nature of the VLMs' pre-training could negatively affect the
properties of the predicted conformal sets for specific tasks. While common
practice in transfer learning for discriminative purposes involves an
adaptation stage, we observe that deploying such a solution for conformal
purposes is suboptimal since adapting the model using the available calibration
data breaks the rigid exchangeability assumptions for test data in SCP. To
address this issue, we propose transductive split conformal adaptation (SCA-T),
a novel pipeline for transfer learning on conformal scenarios, which performs
an unsupervised transductive adaptation jointly on calibration and test data.
We present comprehensive experiments utilizing medical VLMs across various
image modalities, transfer tasks, and non-conformity scores. Our framework
offers consistent gains in efficiency and conditional coverage compared to SCP,
maintaining the same empirical guarantees.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven framework for personalized golf swing analysis using a wrist-worn sensor, reconstructing full-body kinematics and detecting technical flaws with neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in golf swing analysis, such as isolated metrics and lack of rich movement representations, by providing a holistic, scalable solution.

Method: Uses a large dataset of professional swings, reconstructs 3D kinematics, generates synthetic inertial data, and trains neural networks to infer motion and segment swing phases.

Result: Accurately estimates full-body kinematics and swing events, detects technical flaws, and predicts player identity, club type, sex, and age.

Conclusion: Bridges lab and field biomechanics, offering scalable motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention, while challenging common assumptions about golf swings.

Abstract: Despite its importance for performance and injury prevention, golf swing
analysis is limited by isolated metrics, underrepresentation of professional
athletes, and a lack of rich, interpretable movement representations. We
address these gaps with a holistic, data-driven framework for personalized golf
swing analysis from a single wrist-worn sensor. We build a large dataset of
professional swings from publicly available videos, reconstruct full-body 3D
kinematics using biologically accurate human mesh recovery, and generate
synthetic inertial data to train neural networks that infer motion and segment
swing phases from wrist-based input. We learn a compositional, discrete
vocabulary of motion primitives that facilitates the detection and
visualization of technical flaws, and is expressive enough to predict player
identity, club type, sex, and age. Our system accurately estimates full-body
kinematics and swing events from wrist data, delivering lab-grade motion
analysis on-course and supporting early detection of anomalous movement
patterns. Explainability methods reveal subtle, individualized movement
signatures, reinforcing the view that variability is a hallmark of skilled
performance. Longitudinal tracking demonstrates practical value: as one
player's handicap improved from 50 to 2.2 over 1.5 years, our system captured
measurable technical progress and provided targeted, actionable feedback. Our
findings challenge common assumptions, such as swing consistency across clubs
and the existence of a single "ideal" swing, and uncover latent biomarkers
shaped by both intrinsic traits and task-specific constraints. This work
bridges lab and field-based biomechanics, offering scalable, accessible,
high-fidelity motion analysis for research, coaching, and injury prevention,
while opening new directions in movement-based phenotyping, personalized
equipment design, and motor skill development.

*Zhihao Yuan,Shuyi Jiang,Chun-Mei Feng,Yaolun Zhang,Shuguang Cui,Zhen Li,Na Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scene-R1 is a video-grounded framework for 3D scene understanding without 3D instance supervision, using reinforcement learning and a two-stage grounding pipeline. It outperforms baselines and provides transparent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D-aware LLMs lack transparency and rely on pre-trained 3D detectors. Scene-R1 aims to eliminate this dependency and improve interpretability.

Method: Uses a two-stage grounding pipeline: temporal grounding to select relevant video snippets and image grounding to predict 2D bounding boxes. Tracks objects with SAM2 for pixel-accurate masks and projects them into 3D.

Result: Surpasses open-vocabulary baselines on multiple datasets and provides step-by-step rationales.

Conclusion: Reinforcement-learning-based reasoning with RGB-D video offers a practical, annotation-efficient path to trustworthy 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is
becoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output
bounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are
made, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object
proposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to
reason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by
pairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding
pipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video
and select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the
subsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D
bounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce
pixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby
eliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine
geometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question
answering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training
pipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D
point-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on
multiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These
results show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D
video alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D
scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SynDaCaTE, a synthetic dataset for evaluating capsule networks, and identifies limitations in existing models while highlighting the effectiveness of permutation-equivariant self-attention for parts-to-wholes inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating whether capsule networks truly learn part-whole hierarchies, as claimed, due to the difficulty in assessing such models trained end-to-end on supervised tasks.

Method: The authors present SynDaCaTE, a synthetic dataset, and use it to analyze a prominent capsule model and test the efficacy of permutation-equivariant self-attention for parts-to-wholes inference.

Result: The study reveals a bottleneck in the existing capsule model and demonstrates that permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes inference.

Conclusion: The findings motivate future research into designing better inductive biases for computer vision, leveraging insights from the analysis of SynDaCaTE.

Abstract: Learning to infer object representations, and in particular part-whole
hierarchies, has been the focus of extensive research in computer vision, in
pursuit of improving data efficiency, systematic generalisation, and
robustness. Models which are \emph{designed} to infer part-whole hierarchies,
often referred to as capsule networks, are typically trained end-to-end on
supervised tasks such as object classification, in which case it is difficult
to evaluate whether such a model \emph{actually} learns to infer part-whole
hierarchies, as claimed. To address this difficulty, we present a SYNthetic
DAtaset for CApsule Testing and Evaluation, abbreviated as SynDaCaTE, and
establish its utility by (1) demonstrating the precise bottleneck in a
prominent existing capsule model, and (2) demonstrating that
permutation-equivariant self-attention is highly effective for parts-to-wholes
inference, which motivates future directions for designing effective inductive
biases for computer vision.

*Chongkai Gao,Zixuan Liu,Zhenghao Chi,Junshan Huang,Xin Fei,Yiwen Hou,Yuxuan Zhang,Yudi Lin,Zhirui Fang,Zeyu Jiang,Lin Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces VLA-OS, a unified Vision-Language-Action architecture, to systematically compare planning paradigms and representations, finding visually grounded planning and hierarchical paradigms superior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models vary widely in architecture and training, making it hard to pinpoint performance drivers. The study aims to isolate and evaluate planning paradigms and representations.

Method: VLA-OS is designed for controlled experiments across diverse object categories, modalities, environments, and end-effectors to compare planning paradigms and representations.

Result: Visually grounded planning outperforms language-based planning, and hierarchical paradigms excel in performance, generalization, and scalability, though slower.

Conclusion: Hierarchical-VLA paradigms with visually grounded representations are recommended for complex tasks, despite slower speeds.

Abstract: Recent studies on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shifted from the
end-to-end action-generation paradigm toward a pipeline involving task planning
followed by action generation, demonstrating improved performance on various
complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches vary
significantly in terms of network architectures, planning paradigms,
representations, and training data sources, making it challenging for
researchers to identify the precise sources of performance gains and components
to be further improved. To systematically investigate the impacts of different
planning paradigms and representations isolating from network architectures and
training data, in this paper, we introduce VLA-OS, a unified VLA architecture
series capable of various task planning paradigms, and design a comprehensive
suite of controlled experiments across diverse object categories (rigid and
deformable), visual modalities (2D and 3D), environments (simulation and
real-world), and end-effectors (grippers and dexterous hands). Our results
demonstrate that: 1) visually grounded planning representations are generally
better than language planning representations; 2) the Hierarchical-VLA paradigm
generally achieves superior or comparable performance than other paradigms on
task performance, pretraining, generalization ability, scalability, and
continual learning ability, albeit at the cost of slower training and inference
speeds.

*Haoxuan Che,Haibo Jin,Zhengrui Guo,Yi Lin,Cheng Jin,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedMRG is a federated learning framework for privacy-preserving, multi-center development of LLM-driven medical report generation, addressing communication efficiency and data heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralizing medical image-report pairs for LLM-driven MRG is challenging due to privacy regulations, hindering model development and adoption.

Method: FedMRG employs low-rank factorization for efficient parameter updates, client-aware contrastive learning, and a dual-adapter mechanism to handle data heterogeneity.

Result: FedMRG demonstrates generalizability and adaptability, enabling clinically accurate report generation while maintaining communication efficiency.

Conclusion: FedMRG effectively leverages multi-center data for LLM-driven MRG, overcoming privacy and heterogeneity challenges.

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation
(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report
pairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these
data is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding
model development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address
this challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated
Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of
LLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge
of communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.
To start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication
overhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently
decompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs
and making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.
Furthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:
varying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse
reporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further
enhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,
coupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally
generalizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic
accuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder
that harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in
reporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our
established FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and
adaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center
data and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication
efficiency.

TL;DR: HalluRNN introduces an architecture-level solution to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs using a Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) for recurrent cross-layer reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often generate visually ungrounded outputs (hallucinations). Existing solutions require heavy resources or task-specific setups.

Method: Proposes HalluRNN with DG-DPU, a shared module for recurrent refinement of hidden states to enforce layer consistency.

Result: HalluRNN achieves robust performance across benchmarks by fine-tuning only DG-DPU.

Conclusion: HalluRNN offers an efficient, architecture-level solution to reduce hallucinations in LVLMs.

Abstract: Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across various tasks, they are still prone to
hallucinations-generating outputs that are textually plausible but visually
ungrounded. While prior approaches generally address this issue through
data-centric fine-tuning or innovative decoding strategies, these methods often
require substantial resources or task-specific configurations. In this work, we
introduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model
stability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a
novel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across
layers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive
propagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across
layers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift. By
fine-tuning only the DG-DPU module, HalluRNN achieves strong and robust
performance across multiple benchmarks.

*Mihir Godbole,Xiangbo Gao,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRAMA-X is a benchmark for evaluating multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical scenarios for autonomous driving, featuring annotations for object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. SGG-Intent, a lightweight framework, is proposed as a baseline, showing improved performance with scene-graph-based reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for fine-grained intent reasoning in autonomous driving, particularly for vulnerable road users (VRUs), is unmet by existing benchmarks and vision-language models (VLMs).

Method: DRAMA-X is introduced as a benchmark with automated annotations. SGG-Intent, a training-free framework, uses VLM-backed detectors and a large language model for scene-graph-based reasoning.

Result: Scene-graph-based reasoning improves intent prediction and risk assessment, especially with explicit contextual cues.

Conclusion: DRAMA-X fills a critical gap in evaluating intent reasoning for autonomous driving, and SGG-Intent demonstrates the effectiveness of structured reasoning pipelines.

Abstract: Understanding the short-term motion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) like
pedestrians and cyclists is critical for safe autonomous driving, especially in
urban scenarios with ambiguous or high-risk behaviors. While vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for
fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing
benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical
situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark
constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline.
DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding
boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores,
expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion
summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four
interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection,
intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference
baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that
mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene
graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses
risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by
a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing
performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment,
especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.

*Younghun Kim,Minsuk Jang,Myung-Joon Kwon,Wonjun Lee,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of face identity in deepfake detection, proposing SELFI, a framework that adaptively controls identity features for better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conflicting views exist on whether identity features should be suppressed or relied upon for deepfake detection. The study aims to reconcile these by analyzing identity's discriminative power and generalization across manipulation methods.

Method: The paper introduces SELFI, which includes a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) and an Identity-Aware Fusion Module (IAFM) to dynamically modulate identity usage.

Result: SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior methods by 3.1% AUC on average and by 6% on the DFDC dataset.

Conclusion: Identity features should be explicitly modeled and adaptively controlled, as demonstrated by SELFI's effectiveness in deepfake detection.

Abstract: Face identity provides a powerful signal for deepfake detection. Prior
studies show that even when not explicitly modeled, classifiers often learn
identity features implicitly. This has led to conflicting views: some suppress
identity cues to reduce bias, while others rely on them as forensic evidence.
To reconcile these views, we analyze two hypotheses: (1) whether face identity
alone is discriminative for detecting deepfakes, and (2) whether such identity
features generalize poorly across manipulation methods. Our experiments confirm
that identity is informative but context-dependent. While some manipulations
preserve identity-consistent artifacts, others distort identity cues and harm
generalization. We argue that identity features should neither be blindly
suppressed nor relied upon, but instead be explicitly modeled and adaptively
controlled based on per-sample relevance. We propose \textbf{SELFI}
(\textbf{SEL}ective \textbf{F}usion of \textbf{I}dentity), a generalizable
detection framework that dynamically modulates identity usage. SELFI consists
of: (1) a Forgery-Aware Identity Adapter (FAIA) that extracts identity
embeddings from a frozen face recognition model and projects them into a
forgery-relevant space via auxiliary supervision; and (2) an Identity-Aware
Fusion Module (IAFM) that selectively integrates identity and visual features
using a relevance-guided fusion mechanism. Experiments on four benchmarks show
that SELFI improves cross-manipulation generalization, outperforming prior
methods by an average of 3.1\% AUC. On the challenging DFDC dataset, SELFI
exceeds the previous best by 6\%. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of PD is critical due to its incurable nature and rapid progression, but existing methods face challenges like limited data, specialized equipment needs, and single-modality risks.

Method: Proposes a multimodal approach combining facial expressions and gait, using a lightweight deep learning model for feature extraction and fusion to enhance accuracy and mobile deployment.

Result: Developed the largest multimodal PD dataset and validated the method's effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method improves PD diagnosis accuracy and generalizability, offering a practical solution for early detection.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by its incurable nature, rapid
progression, and severe disability, poses significant challenges to the lives
of patients and their families. Given the aging population, the need for early
detection of PD is increasing. In vitro diagnosis has garnered attention due to
its non-invasive nature and low cost. However, existing methods present several
challenges: 1) limited training data for facial expression diagnosis; 2)
specialized equipment and acquisition environments required for gait diagnosis,
resulting in poor generalizability; 3) the risk of misdiagnosis or missed
diagnosis when relying on a single modality. To address these issues, we
propose a novel multimodal in vitro diagnostic method for PD, leveraging facial
expressions and behavioral gait. Our method employs a lightweight deep learning
model for feature extraction and fusion, aimed at improving diagnostic accuracy
and facilitating deployment on mobile devices. Furthermore, we have established
the largest multimodal PD dataset in collaboration with a hospital and
conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

brain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the
conventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,
enabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data. We trained our model on
ADNI2 $\&$ 3 (N=1348) and OASIS3 (N=716) datasets (age range: 42 - 95) from the
North America, with an 8:1:1 split for train, validation and test. Then, we
validated it on the AIBL dataset (N=768, age range: 60 - 92) from Australia.
Results: We achieved an MAE of 3.65 years on ADNI2 $\&$ 3 and OASIS3 test set
and a high generalizability of MAE of 3.54 years on AIBL. There was a notable
increase in brain age gap (BAG) across cognitive groups, with mean of 0.15
years (95% CI: [-0.22, 0.51]) in CN, 2.55 years ([2.40, 2.70]) in MCI, 6.12
years ([5.82, 6.43]) in AD. Additionally, significant negative correlation
between BAG and cognitive scores was observed, with correlation coefficient of
-0.185 (p < 0.001) for MoCA and -0.231 (p < 0.001) for MMSE. Gradient-based
feature attribution highlighted ventricles and white matter structures as key
regions influenced by brain aging. Conclusion: Our model effectively fused
information from different views and volumetric information to achieve
state-of-the-art brain age prediction accuracy, improved generalizability and
interpretability with association to neurodegenerative disorders.

*Nikitha SR,Aradhya Neeraj Mathur,Tarun Ram Menta,Rishabh Jain,Mausoom Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A shallow feature enricher reduces computational costs while maintaining competitive performance in high-resolution multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image features improve visual understanding but increase computational costs due to multiple encoder calls.

Method: Proposes a shallow feature enricher for feature upsampling, tested through experiments and ablations.

Result: Achieves competitive results with 1.5x FLOPs savings, reducing training and inference time.

Conclusion: Feature upsampling via a shallow enricher is efficient and effective for high-resolution tasks.

Abstract: The integration of high-resolution image features in modern multimodal large
language models has demonstrated significant improvements in fine-grained
visual understanding tasks, achieving high performance across multiple
benchmarks. Since these features are obtained from large image encoders like
ViT, they come with a significant increase in computational costs due to
multiple calls to these encoders. In this work, we first develop an intuition
for feature upsampling as a natural extension of high-resolution feature
generation. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate how a
shallow feature enricher can achieve competitive results with tremendous
reductions in training and inference time as well as computational cost, with
upto 1.5x saving in FLOPs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JarvisArt is an AI-driven agent for photo retouching, combining user intent understanding with professional artist reasoning, outperforming GPT-4o in fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI tools lack adjustability and generalization, while professional tools require expertise. JarvisArt aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with two-stage training: Chain-of-Thought fine-tuning and GRPO-R for decision-making. Integrates with Lightroom via a custom protocol.

Result: Outperforms GPT-4o by 60% in pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench, offering fine-grained control and superior generalization.

Conclusion: JarvisArt provides a user-friendly, intelligent solution for photo retouching, setting a new standard for AI-driven editing.

Abstract: Photo retouching has become integral to contemporary visual storytelling,
enabling users to capture aesthetics and express creativity. While professional
tools such as Adobe Lightroom offer powerful capabilities, they demand
substantial expertise and manual effort. In contrast, existing AI-based
solutions provide automation but often suffer from limited adjustability and
poor generalization, failing to meet diverse and personalized editing needs. To
bridge this gap, we introduce JarvisArt, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM)-driven agent that understands user intent, mimics the reasoning process
of professional artists, and intelligently coordinates over 200 retouching
tools within Lightroom. JarvisArt undergoes a two-stage training process: an
initial Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning to establish basic reasoning
and tool-use skills, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization for
Retouching (GRPO-R) to further enhance its decision-making and tool
proficiency. We also propose the Agent-to-Lightroom Protocol to facilitate
seamless integration with Lightroom. To evaluate performance, we develop
MMArt-Bench, a novel benchmark constructed from real-world user edits.
JarvisArt demonstrates user-friendly interaction, superior generalization, and
fine-grained control over both global and local adjustments, paving a new
avenue for intelligent photo retouching. Notably, it outperforms GPT-4o with a
60% improvement in average pixel-level metrics on MMArt-Bench for content
fidelity, while maintaining comparable instruction-following capabilities.

*Kailing Li,Qi'ao Xu,Tianwen Qian,Yuqian Fu,Yang Jiao,Xiaoling Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLiViS is a training-free framework combining LLMs for task planning and VLMs for visual perception, using a dynamic Cognitive Map to bridge perception and reasoning in Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EVR faces challenges from diverse instructions and spatiotemporal dynamics in egocentric videos. Existing methods (LLMs or VLMs alone) lack detail or compositional reasoning.

Method: CLiViS integrates LLMs for high-level planning and VLMs for visual perception, iteratively updating a dynamic Cognitive Map to structure scene context.

Result: CLiViS shows effectiveness in handling long-term visual dependencies across benchmarks.

Conclusion: CLiViS successfully bridges perception and reasoning in EVR, offering a robust solution for complex instructions and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Reasoning (EVR) seeks to follow complex, free-form
instructions based on egocentric video, enabling semantic understanding and
spatiotemporal reasoning in dynamic environments. Despite its promising
potential, EVR encounters significant challenges stemming from the diversity of
complex instructions and the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics in long-term
egocentric videos. Prior solutions either employ Large Language Models (LLMs)
over static video captions, which often omit critical visual details, or rely
on end-to-end Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that struggle with stepwise
compositional reasoning. Consider the complementary strengths of LLMs in
reasoning and VLMs in perception, we propose CLiViS. It is a novel
training-free framework that leverages LLMs for high-level task planning and
orchestrates VLM-driven open-world visual perception to iteratively update the
scene context. Building on this synergy, the core of CLiViS is a dynamic
Cognitive Map that evolves throughout the reasoning process. This map
constructs a structured representation of the embodied scene, bridging
low-level perception and high-level reasoning. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLiViS,
especially in handling long-term visual dependencies. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PatchHunter, an optimization-free adversarial patch attack for Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE), outperforming traditional methods in real-world applicability and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing methods are limited to unrealistic settings. The paper aims to design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and transferable attacks.

Method: Proposes PatchHunter, a reinforcement learning-driven search over visual patterns to disrupt SDE assumptions, avoiding optimization-based limitations.

Result: PatchHunter excels in effectiveness and transferability across KITTI, CARLA, and real-world tests, maintaining success under challenging conditions.

Conclusion: PatchHunter demonstrates superior performance over optimization-based methods, highlighting the potential of pattern-based attacks for real-world SDE vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Stereo Depth Estimation (SDE) is essential for scene understanding in
vision-based systems like autonomous driving. However, recent studies show that
SDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to
unrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in
static scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a
critical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and
transferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?
  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified
attack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages
of stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost
aggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation
across 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,
reveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.
Interestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather
than pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated
by this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch
attack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement
learning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to
disrupt SDE assumptions.
  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA
simulator, and real-world vehicle deployment. PatchHunter not only surpasses
optimization-based methods in effectiveness but also achieves significantly
better black-box transferability. Even under challenging physical conditions
like low light, PatchHunter maintains high attack success (e.g., D1-all > 0.4),
whereas optimization-based methods fail.

*Xiang Fang,Arvind Easwaran,Blaise Genest*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMCN, a novel network for few-shot OOD detection, leveraging CLIP and adaptive prompts to improve performance with limited labeled ID samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OOD detection methods require many IID samples, limiting real-world applications. Few-shot OOD detection is more challenging due to scarce labeled ID samples and ignored class diversity.

Method: Proposes AMCN, which uses adaptive prompts (ID and OOD) and a class-wise threshold to learn inter- and intra-class distributions. It also includes a prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module.

Result: AMCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot OOD detection.

Conclusion: AMCN effectively addresses the challenges of few-shot OOD detection by leveraging adaptive prompts and CLIP, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection attempts to distinguish outlier samples
to prevent models trained on the in-distribution (ID) dataset from producing
unavailable outputs. Most OOD detection methods require many IID samples for
training, which seriously limits their real-world applications. To this end, we
target a challenging setting: few-shot OOD detection, where {Only a few {\em
labeled ID} samples are available.} Therefore, few-shot OOD detection is much
more challenging than the traditional OOD detection setting. Previous few-shot
OOD detection works ignore the distinct diversity between different classes. In
this paper, we propose a novel network: Adaptive Multi-prompt Contrastive
Network (AMCN), which adapts the ID-OOD separation boundary by learning inter-
and intra-class distribution. To compensate for the absence of OOD and scarcity
of ID {\em image samples}, we leverage CLIP, connecting text with images,
engineering learnable ID and OOD {\em textual prompts}. Specifically, we first
generate adaptive prompts (learnable ID prompts, label-fixed OOD prompts and
label-adaptive OOD prompts). Then, we generate an adaptive class boundary for
each class by introducing a class-wise threshold. Finally, we propose a
prompt-guided ID-OOD separation module to control the margin between ID and OOD
prompts. Experimental results show that AMCN outperforms other state-of-the-art
works.

Abstract: Automating medical report generation from histopathology images is a critical
challenge requiring effective visual representations and domain-specific
knowledge. Inspired by the common practices of human experts, we propose an
in-context learning framework called PathGenIC that integrates context derived
from the training set with a multimodal in-context learning (ICL) mechanism.
Our method dynamically retrieves semantically similar whole slide image
(WSI)-report pairs and incorporates adaptive feedback to enhance contextual

framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with significant improvements
across BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics, and demonstrates robustness across
diverse report lengths and disease categories. By maximizing training data
utility and bridging vision and language with ICL, our work offers a solution
for AI-driven histopathology reporting, setting a strong foundation for future
advancements in multimodal clinical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDSAM reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by dynamically refining attention to image tokens, improving reliability without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LVLMs arise from sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, evidenced by attention peaks.

Method: Proposes MDSAM, a training-free approach that memorizes and refines attention patterns to relevant image tokens.

Result: MDSAM consistently reduces hallucinations and improves performance in tasks like image captioning and VQA.

Conclusion: MDSAM is adaptable, effective, and compatible with various LVLM architectures, mitigating hallucinations without extra training.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) often stem from the
model's sensitivity to image tokens during decoding, as evidenced by attention
peaks observed when generating both real and hallucinated entities. To address
this, we propose Memory-Driven Sparse Attention Matrix (MDSAM) , a novel
training-free approach that dynamically captures and refines the attention
allocated to image tokens at each layer. MDSAM memorizes attention patterns and
activates updates through alignment during decoding, enhancing focus on
relevant image tokens while effectively reducing hallucinations. We evaluate
MDSAM on multiple benchmarks for tasks such as image captioning and visual
question answering, demonstrating its ability to consistently reduce
hallucinations and improve reliability. Compatible with various LVLM
architectures, MDSAM highlights its adaptability and effectiveness in
mitigating hallucinations without requiring additional training or external
tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CSDN, a Transformer-based detection header replacing traditional attention mechanisms with a gating mechanism for better feature utilization and global context modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs' limited receptive fields hinder global context capture, and the paper argues feature utilization is as crucial as extraction. It questions DETR's self-attention redundancy.

Method: Proposes CSDN, a gating mechanism replacing stacked self/cross-attention layers, enabling adaptive feature and scale selection for ROIs.

Result: CSDN improves detection accuracy with minimal fine-tuning, avoiding extensive re-training, and adapts well to objects of varying sizes.

Conclusion: CSDN efficiently utilizes CNN backbone features, offering superior global context modeling and adaptability, with easy integration into existing detectors.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target
detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which
hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. This paper
believes that the effective utilization of extracted features is as important
as the feature extraction process itself. We critically re-evaluated the
DETR-inspired header network architecture, questioning the indispensable nature
of its self-attention mechanism, and discovering significant information
redundancies. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated
Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header
inspired by natural language processing architecture and human visual
perception. CSDN aims to efficiently utilize the characteristics of the CNN
backbone network by replacing the traditional stacked self-attention and
cross-attention layers with a novel gating mechanism. This mechanism enables
each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature
dimensions and scale information from multiple attention patterns. CSDN
provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better
adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head
can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only
a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-training weights can significantly
improve the detection accuracy, thus avoiding the need to achieve small
improvements. Various layer modules undergo extensive re-training.

TL;DR: Proposes SeqDG, a domain generalization method for Egocentric Action Recognition, using action sequences and visual-text reconstruction to improve performance in unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance drop in Egocentric Action Recognition models when tested in unseen environments due to variability in illumination, viewpoint, and environment.

Method: Introduces SeqDG with SeqRec (visual-text sequence reconstruction) and SeqMix (training on mixed sequences from different domains).

Result: +2.4% relative improvement on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and +0.6% Top-1 accuracy on EGTEA over SOTA.

Conclusion: SeqDG effectively enhances generalization in unseen environments for egocentric action recognition.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities from visual inputs, particularly through a
first-person viewpoint, is essential for enabling robots to replicate human
behavior. Egocentric vision, characterized by cameras worn by observers,
captures diverse changes in illumination, viewpoint, and environment. This
variability leads to a notable drop in the performance of Egocentric Action
Recognition models when tested in environments not seen during training. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a domain generalization
approach for Egocentric Action Recognition. Our insight is that action
sequences often reflect consistent user intent across visual domains. By
leveraging action sequences, we aim to enhance the model's generalization
ability across unseen environments. Our proposed method, named SeqDG,
introduces a visual-text sequence reconstruction objective (SeqRec) that uses
contextual cues from both text and visual inputs to reconstruct the central
action of the sequence. Additionally, we enhance the model's robustness by
training it on mixed sequences of actions from different domains (SeqMix). We
validate SeqDG on the EGTEA and EPIC-KITCHENS-100 datasets. Results on
EPIC-KITCHENS-100, show that SeqDG leads to +2.4% relative average improvement
in cross-domain action recognition in unseen environments, and on EGTEA the
model achieved +0.6% Top-1 accuracy over SOTA in intra-domain action
recognition.

Motivation: Overcome limitations of labeled data dependency and computational expense in traditional methods.

Method: Unified framework with a shared vision transformer backbone for audio and visual inputs, using asymmetric masking and masked data modeling.

Conclusion: Proposed method is scalable, efficient, and effective for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification.

Abstract: Conventional audio-visual methods for speaker verification rely on large
amounts of labeled data and separate modality-specific architectures, which is
computationally expensive, limiting their scalability. To address these
problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive
learning with asymmetric masking and masked data modeling to obtain robust
audiovisual feature representations. In particular, we employ a unified
framework for self-supervised audiovisual speaker verification using a single
shared backbone for audio and visual inputs, leveraging the versatility of
vision transformers. The proposed unified framework can handle audio, visual,
or audiovisual inputs using a single shared vision transformer backbone during
training and testing while being computationally efficient and robust to
missing modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance without labeled data while reducing computational costs

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamJourney is a two-stage framework for perpetual dynamic scene view generation, combining 3D point cloud rendering and video diffusion models to handle camera movements and object dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack 3D awareness and fail to capture dynamic object movements, leading to distorted artifacts in perpetual view generation.

Method: Stage I: Lifts input image to 3D point cloud, renders partial images, and uses video diffusion for completion. Stage II: Uses a multimodal LLM to describe object movements and animate the view.

Result: DreamJourney outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating coherent, dynamic scenes with improved visual quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations of prior work, enabling perpetual dynamic scene generation with both camera and object movements.

Abstract: Perpetual view generation aims to synthesize a long-term video corresponding
to an arbitrary camera trajectory solely from a single input image. Recent
methods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to
synthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.
However, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in
distorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static
3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.
To alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that
leverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a
new perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object
dynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to
3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera
trajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to
complete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,
producing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera
trajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early
stopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and
improve visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal
large language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in
current view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with
object movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual
dynamic scene view generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our DreamJourney over state-of-the-art methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Our project page:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise control over 3D room attributes through natural language, decomposing the complex task into manageable steps.

Method: Decomposes tasks into steps like 3D coordinate generation, panorama texture creation, and furniture arrangement, using visual programming and a diffusion model enhanced by bidirectional LSTM.

Result: Demonstrates flexibility in 3D room generation/editing and outperforms existing models quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: Programmable-Room offers a unified, efficient solution for interactive 3D room design via natural language.

Abstract: We present Programmable-Room, a framework which interactively generates and
edits a 3D room mesh, given natural language instructions. For precise control
of a room's each attribute, we decompose the challenging task into simpler
steps such as creating plausible 3D coordinates for room meshes, generating
panorama images for the texture, constructing 3D meshes by integrating the
coordinates and panorama texture images, and arranging furniture. To support
the various decomposed tasks with a unified framework, we incorporate visual
programming (VP). VP is a method that utilizes a large language model (LLM) to
write a Python-like program which is an ordered list of necessary modules for
the various tasks given in natural language. We develop most of the modules.
Especially, for the texture generating module, we utilize a pretrained
large-scale diffusion model to generate panorama images conditioned on text and
visual prompts (i.e., layout, depth, and semantic map) simultaneously.
Specifically, we enhance the panorama image generation quality by optimizing
the training objective with a 1D representation of a panorama scene obtained
from bidirectional LSTM. We demonstrate Programmable-Room's flexibility in
generating and editing 3D room meshes, and prove our framework's superiority to
an existing model quantitatively and qualitatively. Project page is available

TL;DR: The paper proposes PDC-Net, a novel network for PRI segmentation in MRI, using modules like MDA and MGC to handle complex organ shapes and confusing context, achieving superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PRI segmentation is vital for prognosis and personalized treatment, but automated methods struggle with complex organ shapes and confusing context.

Method: PDC-Net divides tasks into local/global patterns using MDA for shape fitting and MGC for context distinction, with AFD dynamically fusing features for segmentation.

Result: PDC-Net outperforms existing methods on a large-scale PRI dataset.

Conclusion: PDC-Net effectively addresses PRI segmentation challenges, offering improved accuracy for clinical applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of Pelvic Radiation Injury (PRI) from Magnetic
Resonance Images (MRI) is crucial for more precise prognosis assessment and the
development of personalized treatment plans. However, automated segmentation
remains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and
confusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern
Divide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to
use different network modules to "divide" various local and global patterns
and, through flexible feature selection, to "conquer" the Regions of Interest
(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often
manifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce
a Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's
ability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four
distinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing
context, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module
explicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the
dataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns
associated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an
Adaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different
patterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating
the final segmentation results. We evaluate our method on the first large-scale
pelvic radiation injury dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of
our PDC-Net over existing approaches.

TL;DR: YOLOv13 introduces HyperACE for global high-order correlations and FullPAD for efficient feature fusion, outperforming YOLO11 and YOLOv12 with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing YOLO models lack global high-order correlation modeling, limiting performance in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes HyperACE for adaptive high-order correlation and FullPAD for feature synergy, using depthwise separable convolutions.

Result: YOLOv13 achieves 3.0% and 1.5% mAP improvements over YOLO11-N and YOLOv12-N, respectively, with fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: YOLOv13 is a lightweight, high-performance detector with global correlation modeling and efficient feature fusion.

Abstract: The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to
their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the
convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based
self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information
aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to
capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection
performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an
accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned
challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement
(HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations
and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to
pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving
efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement.
Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD)
paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information
flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing
correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to
leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel
convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce
parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing mobile user experiences through interactive and AR/VR applications by overcoming the limitations of static images and complex input requirements.

Method: Leverages large generative models for 3D mesh generation and physical property prediction, integrating an on-device physics engine for real-time rendering.

Result: Demonstrates cohesive functioning of modules, enabling real-time, non-deterministic interactions with efficient memory use.

Conclusion: PhysID advances mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering scalable, user-personalized experiences with minimal manual intervention.

Abstract: Transforming static images into interactive experiences remains a challenging
task in computer vision. Tackling this challenge holds the potential to elevate
mobile user experiences, notably through interactive and AR/VR applications.
Current approaches aim to achieve this either using pre-recorded video
responses or requiring multi-view images as input. In this paper, we present
PhysID, that streamlines the creation of physics-based interactive dynamics
from a single-view image by leveraging large generative models for 3D mesh
generation and physical property prediction. This significantly reduces the
expertise required for engineering-intensive tasks like 3D modeling and
intrinsic property calibration, enabling the process to be scaled with minimal
manual intervention. We integrate an on-device physics-based engine for
physically plausible real-time rendering with user interactions. PhysID
represents a leap forward in mobile-based interactive dynamics, offering
real-time, non-deterministic interactions and user-personalization with
efficient on-device memory consumption. Experiments evaluate the zero-shot
capabilities of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on diverse
tasks and the performance of 3D reconstruction models. These results
demonstrate the cohesive functioning of all modules within the end-to-end
framework, contributing to its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoLA-SpecViT is a lightweight spectral vision transformer for hyperspectral image classification, combining 3D convolution and local self-attention with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for efficiency. It achieves high accuracy with fewer parameters and adapts well to limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral image classification faces challenges like high dimensionality, redundancy, and limited annotated samples. Existing transformer models lack scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions.

Method: Proposes LoLA-SpecViT, integrating a 3D convolutional spectral front-end, local window-based self-attention, and LoRA for parameter efficiency. Uses a cyclical learning rate scheduler for better adaptation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three datasets (WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, Salinas), achieving up to 99.91% accuracy with fewer parameters and robustness in low-label regimes.

Conclusion: LoLA-SpecViT offers a scalable, generalizable solution for hyperspectral imagery applications, with code available on GitHub.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality of spectral data, significant inter-band redundancy, and the
limited availability of annotated samples. While recent transformer-based
models have improved the global modeling of spectral-spatial dependencies,
their scalability and adaptability under label-scarce conditions remain
limited. In this work, we propose \textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation
Local Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision
transformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient
architecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.
Our model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local
window-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and
spatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve
adaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and
projection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\% fewer trainable
parameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation
strength during training, improving convergence and generalisation. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets WHU-Hi LongKou, WHU-Hi HongHu, and
Salinas demonstrate that LoLA-SpecViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving up to 99.91\% accuracy with substantially fewer parameters
and enhanced robustness under low-label regimes. The proposed framework
provides a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world HSI applications
in agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing analytics. Our

*Gelei Xu,Yuying Duan,Zheyuan Liu,Xueyang Li,Meng Jiang,Michael Lemmon,Wei Jin,Yiyu Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairMoE is a framework using dynamic mixture-of-experts to address bias in AI-based skin disease diagnostics, improving accuracy without sacrificing fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems for skin disease diagnostics often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable outcomes. Existing bias mitigation methods degrade performance by losing clinically relevant cues.

Method: Proposes FairMoE, a framework with layer-wise mixture-of-experts modules that dynamically route data to group-specific learners, handling cases near group boundaries effectively.

Result: FairMoE achieves substantial accuracy improvements while maintaining comparable fairness metrics, unlike previous methods that reduce performance.

Conclusion: FairMoE offers a promising alternative to traditional bias mitigation by dynamically leveraging sensitive attributes, balancing accuracy and fairness.

Abstract: AI-based systems have achieved high accuracy in skin disease diagnostics but
often exhibit biases across demographic groups, leading to inequitable
healthcare outcomes and diminished patient trust. Most existing bias mitigation
methods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and
diagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the
lost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an
alternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve
fairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise
mixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike
traditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE
dynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly
effective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show
that, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE
achieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness
metrics.

*Assefa Wahd,Jacob Jaremko,Abhilash Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal introduces a time-contrastive self-supervised objective for visual in-context learning (ICL), reframing it as a video object segmentation task to overcome grid-based limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grid-based ICL lacks flexibility for vision tasks, restricting context image count and resolution.

Method: Pretrains a prompt retriever via self-supervised learning, using adjacent frames as positives and distant frames as negatives. ICL is treated as a video segmentation task.

Result: Achieves 90.95% Dice for image segmentation (10.64% improvement) and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement) on MICCAI FLARE 2022.

Conclusion: Temporal outperforms baselines by enabling flexible, high-resolution context images and effective prompt retrieval.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables generalization to new tasks with minimal
labeled data. However, mainstream ICL approaches rely on a gridding strategy,
which lacks the flexibility required for vision applications. We introduce
Temporal, a time-contrastive self-supervised objective that pretrains a prompt
retriever for visual ICL, and formulate ICL as a video object segmentation
(VOS) task. Temporal addresses key limitations of grid-based methods that
restrict the number and resolution of context images. By reframing ICL as a VOS
problem, our approach supports a variable number of context images while
preserving their full resolution. To address the challenge of selecting optimal
context sets for queries, we pretrain a prompt retriever on videos via
self-supervised learning, where adjacent frames serve as positives and distant
frames as negatives. For image segmentation, the prompt retriever selects
relevant sequences that, when combined with the query, form coherent videos for
VOS processing. For video segmentation, it identifies keyframes, predicts their
masks using our ICL pipeline, and propagates them throughout the sequence. When
evaluated on MICCAI FLARE 2022, our method achieves substantial improvements
over baselines: 90.95% Dice score for image segmentation (10.64% improvement)
and 92.45% Dice for video segmentation (14.88% improvement).

*Kazuki Naganuma,Shunsuke Ono*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a robust foreground-background separation (FBS) method using convolutional sparse representation (CSR) to handle degraded videos with low frame rates and noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FBS methods fail to accurately separate components in degraded videos due to limited feature capture and lack of explicit noise models.

Method: Uses CSR-based foreground model, multiconvex optimization with CSR, general feature functions, and noise characterization. Solves via alternating convex subproblems.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on degraded infrared and microscope videos.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively separates foreground and background in challenging video conditions.

Abstract: This paper proposes a foreground-background separation (FBS) method with a
novel foreground model based on convolutional sparse representation (CSR). In
order to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under
undesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,
it is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low
frame rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two
limitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and
background components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture
either data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not
include explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS
process. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based
foreground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures
scattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex
optimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general
features, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of
noise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and
general features to accurately separate the components from various types of
noise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization
problem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex
subproblems by newly established algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method over existing methods using two types of degraded
videos: infrared and microscope videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D articulated statistical fetal body model is introduced to improve fetal motion and shape analysis in prenatal diagnostics, addressing limitations of keypoints and segmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis (keypoints or segmentations) have trade-offs: keypoints simplify motion analysis but miss shape details, while segmentations capture shape but complicate temporal analysis.

Method: The authors construct a 3D articulated fetal body model based on SMPL, iteratively estimating pose in image space and shape in canonical pose space. The model is trained on 19,816 MRI volumes from 53 subjects.

Result: The model achieves a surface alignment error of 3.2 mm for 3 mm MRI voxel size, capturing shape and motion robustly and enabling automated anthropometric measurements.

Conclusion: This is the first 3D articulated statistical fetal body model, enhancing prenatal diagnostics by improving motion and shape analysis.

Abstract: Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics
and monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on
anatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body
structure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of
full-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but
complicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address
these limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model
based on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm
iteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the
canonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts
and intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface
observations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on
segmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$
subjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and
provides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated
anthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from
segmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our
method yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.
To our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal
body model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in
prenatal diagnostics. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving semantic segmentation in wild environments for field robots by integrating RGB and thermal data, while addressing computational overhead challenges.

Method: Introduces CM-SS2D for cross-modal state space modeling and CM-SSA for integrating global associations with local spatial features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost, and demonstrates generalizability on the PST900 dataset.

Conclusion: CM-SSM effectively addresses computational limitations while enhancing segmentation performance, offering a scalable solution for resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: The integration of RGB and thermal data can significantly improve semantic
segmentation performance in wild environments for field robots. Nevertheless,
multi-source data processing (e.g. Transformer-based approaches) imposes
significant computational overhead, presenting challenges for
resource-constrained systems. To resolve this critical limitation, we
introduced CM-SSM, an efficient RGB-thermal semantic segmentation architecture
leveraging a cross-modal state space modeling (SSM) approach. Our framework
comprises two key components. First, we introduced a cross-modal
2D-selective-scan (CM-SS2D) module to establish SSM between RGB and thermal
modalities, which constructs cross-modal visual sequences and derives hidden
state representations of one modality from the other. Second, we developed a
cross-modal state space association (CM-SSA) module that effectively integrates
global associations from CM-SS2D with local spatial features extracted through
convolutional operations. In contrast with Transformer-based approaches, CM-SSM
achieves linear computational complexity with respect to image resolution.
Experimental results show that CM-SSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
the CART dataset with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Further
experiments on the PST900 dataset demonstrate its generalizability. Codes are

Motivation: Existing Vid-LLMs lack specialization for fine-grained surgical video analysis, which is crucial for detailed procedural understanding.

Method: Proposes SurgVidLM, trained on the SVU-31K dataset, with a StageFocus mechanism and Multi-frequency Fusion Attention for multi-grained video comprehension.

Result: SurgVidLM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in surgical video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: SurgVidLM bridges the gap in specialized surgical video analysis, demonstrating superior performance in capturing procedural details.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated great
potential in the medical domain, facilitating users to understand surgical
scenes and procedures. Beyond image-based methods, the exploration of Video
Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) has emerged as a promising avenue for
capturing the complex sequences of information involved in surgery. However,
there is still a lack of Vid-LLMs specialized for fine-grained surgical video
understanding tasks, which is crucial for analyzing specific processes or
details within a surgical procedure. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgVidLM,
the first video language model designed to address both full and fine-grained
surgical video comprehension. To train our SurgVidLM, we construct the SVU-31K
dataset which consists of over 31K video-instruction pairs, enabling both
holistic understanding and detailed analysis of surgical procedures.
Furthermore, we introduce the StageFocus mechanism which is a two-stage
framework performing the multi-grained, progressive understanding of surgical
videos. We also develop the Multi-frequency Fusion Attention to effectively
integrate low and high-frequency visual tokens, ensuring the retention of
critical information. Experimental results demonstrate that SurgVidLM
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs in both full and
fine-grained video understanding tasks, showcasing its superior capability in
capturing complex procedural contexts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes StainPIDR, a stain normalization method for pathological images, using structure and color feature decoupling, a fixed color codebook, and cross-attention for restaining. Includes a template selection algorithm for optimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color discrepancies in pathological images due to varying protocols, dyes, and devices degrade computer-aided diagnostics. Addressing this improves diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Decouples images into structure and color features, uses a fixed color codebook, restains via cross-attention, and selects optimal templates for normalization.

Result: StainPIDR effectively normalizes stain colors, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The method performs well in stain normalization, with code to be released publicly.

Abstract: The color appearance of a pathological image is highly related to the imaging
protocols, the proportion of different dyes, and the scanning devices.
Computer-aided diagnostic systems may deteriorate when facing these
color-variant pathological images. In this work, we propose a stain
normalization method called StainPIDR. We try to eliminate this color
discrepancy by decoupling the image into structure features and
vector-quantized color features, restaining the structure features with the
target color features, and decoding the stained structure features to
normalized pathological images. We assume that color features decoupled by
different images with the same color should be exactly the same. Under this
assumption, we train a fixed color vector codebook to which the decoupled color
features will map. In the restaining part, we utilize the cross-attention
mechanism to efficiently stain the structure features. As the target color
(decoupled from a selected template image) will also affect the performance of
stain normalization, we further design a template image selection algorithm to
select a template from a given dataset. In our extensive experiments, we
validate the effectiveness of StainPIDR and the template image selection
algorithm. All the results show that our method can perform well in the stain
normalization task. The code of StainPIDR will be publicly available later.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based methods lack effective modeling of internal relationships among scene and query features, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes adaptive superpoint aggregation, contrastive learning-guided refinement, and relation-aware self-attention to better model relationships.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200, and S3DIS datasets.

Conclusion: Relation3D effectively addresses limitations in feature relationship modeling, achieving superior performance in 3D instance segmentation.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of object instances in a
scene, representing them as binary foreground masks with corresponding semantic
labels. Currently, transformer-based methods are gaining increasing attention
due to their elegant pipelines and superior predictions. However, these methods
primarily focus on modeling the external relationships between scene features
and query features through mask attention. They lack effective modeling of the
internal relationships among scene features as well as between query features.
In light of these disadvantages, we propose \textbf{Relation3D: Enhancing
Relation Modeling for Point Cloud Instance Segmentation}. Specifically, we
introduce an adaptive superpoint aggregation module and a contrastive
learning-guided superpoint refinement module to better represent superpoint
features (scene features) and leverage contrastive learning to guide the
updates of these features. Furthermore, our relation-aware self-attention
mechanism enhances the capabilities of modeling relationships between queries
by incorporating positional and geometric relationships into the self-attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on the ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, ScanNet200 and
S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superior performance of Relation3D.

Result: The datasets are validated as effective, and the proposed baseline method outperforms similar detection techniques.

Conclusion: The work advances machine learning for belt crack detection by providing real-world datasets and a robust baseline method.

Abstract: Conveyor belt is a category of important equipments in modern industry,
widely applied in production and manufacturing Fields. Its health status is
much critical to operation efficiency and safety hazards. Among the factors
affecting belt health, crack is often one of the most threatening risks.
Currently, considering safety, how to intelligently detect belt cracks is
catching an increasing attention. To implement the intelligent detection with
machine learning, real crack samples are believed to be necessary. However,
existing crack datasets primarily focus on pavement scenarios or synthetic
data, no real-world industrial belt crack datasets at all. To propel machine
learning advancement in this field, this paper constructs the first
sequential-image belt crack detection datasets (BeltCrack14ks and
BeltCrack9kd), from real-world factory scenes. Furthermore, to validate
usability and effectiveness, we propose a special baseline method with
triple-domain (i.e., time-space-frequency) feature hierarchical fusion learning
for the two whole-new datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the

TL;DR: EgoWorld is a two-stage framework for translating exocentric views to egocentric ones, overcoming limitations of current methods by using 3D cues and diffusion-based inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric vision is crucial for AR, VR, and robotics, but current methods rely on 2D cues and unrealistic assumptions.

Method: EgoWorld reconstructs egocentric views using projected point clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions, followed by diffusion-based inpainting.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on H2O and TACO datasets, generalizing well to new objects, actions, and scenes.

Conclusion: EgoWorld demonstrates robust performance and generalization, even on unlabeled real-world examples.

Abstract: Egocentric vision is essential for both human and machine visual
understanding, particularly in capturing the detailed hand-object interactions
needed for manipulation tasks. Translating third-person views into first-person
views significantly benefits augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and
robotics applications. However, current exocentric-to-egocentric translation
methods are limited by their dependence on 2D cues, synchronized multi-view
settings, and unrealistic assumptions such as necessity of initial egocentric
frame and relative camera poses during inference. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce EgoWorld, a novel two-stage framework that reconstructs an
egocentric view from rich exocentric observations, including projected point
clouds, 3D hand poses, and textual descriptions. Our approach reconstructs a
point cloud from estimated exocentric depth maps, reprojects it into the
egocentric perspective, and then applies diffusion-based inpainting to produce
dense, semantically coherent egocentric images. Evaluated on the H2O and TACO
datasets, EgoWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates
robust generalization to new objects, actions, scenes, and subjects. Moreover,
EgoWorld shows promising results even on unlabeled real-world examples.

*Yixuan Wu,Yang Zhang,Jian Wu,Philip Torr,Jindong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMGrounded-PostAlign improves MLLMs by reducing reliance on spurious correlations and enhancing visual understanding through multimodal grounding and negative rejection mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often rely on linguistic priors, ignoring visual data, leading to hallucinations and poor performance.

Method: Introduces a post-multimodal alignment framework with visual and textual grounding modules, plus negative rejection and selective reasoning mechanisms.

Result: Significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and hallucination suppression across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMGrounded-PostAlign effectively mitigates hallucinations and enhances MLLMs' visual grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, such
as image captioning and visual question answering. However, they often suffer
from over-reliance on spurious correlations, primarily due to linguistic priors
that distract the model from leveraging actual visual information. To address
these issues, we introduce MMGrounded-PostAlign, a post-multimodal alignment
framework designed to enhance the visual understanding capabilities and
mitigate the hallucinations of MLLMs. Our framework incorporates a multimodal
grounding module for both visual grounding, which identifies the referred
object in the image, and textual grounding, which generates the rationale for
the final answer, ensuring that outputs are anchored in both visual and textual
evidence. To mitigate the hallucinations, we introduce a negative rejection
mechanism in the visual grounding module to distinguish grounded entities from
non-existent objects influenced by linguistic biases. On the textual grounding
side, we propose a selective reasoning mechanism that adjusts the model's
reasoning strategy based on query complexity. Extensive evaluations are
conducted on benchmarks such as POPE, HaloQuest, VQAv2, MME, and MMBench
showing significant improvements in fine-grained visual understanding and
hallucination suppression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CEDO framework to mitigate language biases in Med-VQA using MHO, GMS, and DLR for robust reasoning and balanced learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address spurious correlations in Med-VQA models caused by language biases.

Method: CEDO integrates MHO (adaptive learning rates), GMS (Pareto optimization for modality synergy), and DLR (adaptive loss weights).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on bias-sensitive benchmarks.

Conclusion: CEDO effectively mitigates language biases from causal and effectual perspectives.

Abstract: Existing Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) models often suffer from
language biases, where spurious correlations between question types and answer
categories are inadvertently established. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Cause-Effect Driven Optimization framework called CEDO, that incorporates
three well-established mechanisms, i.e., Modality-driven Heterogeneous
Optimization (MHO), Gradient-guided Modality Synergy (GMS), and
Distribution-adapted Loss Rescaling (DLR), for comprehensively mitigating
language biases from both causal and effectual perspectives. Specifically, MHO
employs adaptive learning rates for specific modalities to achieve
heterogeneous optimization, thus enhancing robust reasoning capabilities.
Additionally, GMS leverages the Pareto optimization method to foster
synergistic interactions between modalities and enforce gradient orthogonality
to eliminate bias updates, thereby mitigating language biases from the effect
side, i.e., shortcut bias. Furthermore, DLR is designed to assign adaptive
weights to individual losses to ensure balanced learning across all answer
categories, effectively alleviating language biases from the cause side, i.e.,
imbalance biases within datasets. Extensive experiments on multiple traditional
and bias-sensitive benchmarks consistently demonstrate the robustness of CEDO
over state-of-the-art competitors.

*Mohamed Benkedadra,Matei Mancas,Sidi Ahmed Mahmoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D stereo vision pipeline for interactive systems is proposed, addressing limitations of 2D and short-range 3D cameras in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 2D and 3D cameras are unreliable in large, complex environments, necessitating a more robust solution for interactive systems.

Method: The pipeline fuses multiple 3D cameras for full scene reconstruction, enabling tasks like event recognition and tracking, and incorporates feedback for adaptation.

Result: Preliminary results demonstrate the pipeline's potential for robust scene understanding and adaptability.

Conclusion: The paper outlines next steps to transition the pipeline into production, highlighting its promise for diverse applications.

Abstract: 2D cameras are often used in interactive systems. Other systems like gaming
consoles provide more powerful 3D cameras for short range depth sensing.
Overall, these cameras are not reliable in large, complex environments. In this
work, we propose a 3D stereo vision based pipeline for interactive systems,
that is able to handle both ordinary and sensitive applications, through robust
scene understanding. We explore the fusion of multiple 3D cameras to do full
scene reconstruction, which allows for preforming a wide range of tasks, like
event recognition, subject tracking, and notification. Using possible feedback
approaches, the system can receive data from the subjects present in the
environment, to learn to make better decisions, or to adapt to completely new
environments. Throughout the paper, we introduce the pipeline and explain our
preliminary experimentation and results. Finally, we draw the roadmap for the
next steps that need to be taken, in order to get this pipeline into production

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanMoGPT improves text-to-motion generation by addressing motion tokenization granularity with progressive planning and flow-enhanced tokenization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based methods for text-to-motion generation lag behind non-LLM methods due to issues with motion tokenization granularity, impacting global semantic alignment and motion details.

Method: PlanMoGPT integrates progressive planning (hierarchical token generation) and flow-enhanced fine-grained tokenization (higher resolution, larger codebook) to balance detail and coherence.

Result: Achieves 63.8% FID improvement (0.380 to 0.141) and 49.9% motion diversity increase, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PlanMoGPT resolves the diversity-quality trade-off in text-to-motion generation, setting new benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in
many multimodal generation tasks, but a significant performance gap still
exists in text-to-motion generation, where LLM-based methods lag far behind
non-LLM methods. We identify the granularity of motion tokenization as a
critical bottleneck: fine-grained tokenization induces local dependency issues,
where LLMs overemphasize short-term coherence at the expense of global semantic
alignment, while coarse-grained tokenization sacrifices motion details. To
resolve this issue, we propose PlanMoGPT, an LLM-based framework integrating
progressive planning and flow-enhanced fine-grained motion tokenization. First,
our progressive planning mechanism leverages LLMs' autoregressive capabilities
to hierarchically generate motion tokens by starting from sparse global plans
and iteratively refining them into full sequences. Second, our flow-enhanced
tokenizer doubles the downsampling resolution and expands the codebook size by
eight times, minimizing detail loss during discretization, while a
flow-enhanced decoder recovers motion nuances. Extensive experiments on
text-to-motion benchmarks demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving FID scores by 63.8% (from 0.380 to 0.141) on
long-sequence generation while enhancing motion diversity by 49.9% compared to
existing methods. The proposed framework successfully resolves the
diversity-quality trade-off that plagues current non-LLM approaches,
establishing new standards for text-to-motion generation.

*Ravi Kant Gupta,Shounak Das,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method for natural images improves domain alignment and handles multimodal distributions using ResNet and FPN architectures, combined with a tailored loss function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods struggle with aligning multimodal distributions in classification tasks.

Method: Uses ResNet and FPN for feature extraction and a tailored combination of loss functions to address challenges like scale, noise, and style shifts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and VisDA-2017 datasets, with comparable performance on DomainNet.

Conclusion: The proposed UDA scheme enhances accuracy, robustness, and training convergence for natural images.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for
natural images. A commonly-used objective for UDA schemes is to enhance domain
alignment in representation space even if there is a domain shift in the input
space. Existing adversarial domain adaptation methods may not effectively align
different domains of multimodal distributions associated with classification
problems. Our approach has two main features. Firstly, its neural architecture
uses the deep structure of ResNet and the effective separation of scales of
feature pyramidal network (FPN) to work with both content and style features.
Secondly, it uses a combination of a novel loss function and judiciously
selected existing loss functions to train the network architecture. This
tailored combination is designed to address challenges inherent to natural
images, such as scale, noise, and style shifts, that occur on top of a
multi-modal (multi-class) distribution. The combined loss function not only
enhances model accuracy and robustness on the target domain but also speeds up
training convergence. Our proposed UDA scheme generalizes better than
state-of-the-art for CNN-based methods on Office-Home, Office-31, and
VisDA-2017 datasets and comaparable for DomainNet dataset.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (ThinkVG) and a verifiable reward mechanism to improve reliability and interpretability in medical visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack reliability and interpretability, limiting trust in model-generated answers for clinical decision-making.

Method: Proposes the ThinkVG dataset with intermediate reasoning steps and a verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves comparable performance with only one-eighth of the training data.

Conclusion: The approach enhances efficiency, effectiveness, and trustworthiness in medical visual question answering.

Abstract: Medical visual question answering aims to support clinical decision-making by
enabling models to answer natural language questions based on medical images.
While recent advances in multi-modal learning have significantly improved
performance, current methods still suffer from limited answer reliability and
poor interpretability, impairing the ability of clinicians and patients to
understand and trust model-generated answers. To address this, this work first
proposes a Thinking with Visual Grounding (ThinkVG) dataset wherein the answer
generation is decomposed into intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly
ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing
fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable
reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving
the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer.
Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of
the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the
proposal. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing change detection in remote sensing by leveraging textual information and addressing modal misalignment for better feature alignment.

Method: Proposes SegChange-R1 with LLM augmentation and a BEV-based spatial transformation module to unify features from different temporal perspectives.

Result: Experiments on four datasets, including a new UAV-based dataset (DVCD), show significant improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves change detection performance and is supported by publicly available code and pre-trained models.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection is widely used in a variety of fields such as
urban planning, terrain and geomorphology analysis, and environmental
monitoring, mainly by analyzing the significant change differences of features
(e.g., building changes) in the same spatial region at different time phases.
In this paper, we propose a large language model (LLM) augmented inference
approach (SegChange-R1), which enhances the detection capability by integrating
textual descriptive information and aims at guiding the model to segment the
more interested change regions, thus accelerating the convergence speed.
Moreover, we design a spatial transformation module (BEV) based on linear
attention, which solves the problem of modal misalignment in change detection
by unifying features from different temporal perspectives onto the BEV space.
In addition, we construct the first dataset for building change detection from
UAV viewpoints (DVCD ), and our experiments on four widely-used change
detection datasets show a significant improvement over existing methods. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning model for classifying tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom CNN with EfficientNetB0, showing EfficientNetB0's superior accuracy (98.4%) due to transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Street bazaars are economically vital but lack automated classification methods for infrastructure like tents, which is inefficient manually.

Method: A custom CNN and EfficientNetB0 were trained on an augmented dataset of 126 original photos, evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and mAP.

Result: EfficientNetB0 outperformed the custom CNN (98.4% vs. 92.8% accuracy), highlighting transfer learning's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models like EfficientNetB0 significantly enhance classification accuracy and generalization for bazaar-specific tasks.

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying
tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a
tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient.
Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their
unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated
classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more
than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have
been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific
tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by
training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to
generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on
Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models
comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification
performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and
EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of
transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the
confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each
model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as
EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional TST methods have low follow-up rates, patient discomfort, and subjective interpretation, leading to misdiagnosis. The app aims to address these issues.

Method: The app uses scaling stickers for induration measurement, integrating ARCore and DeepLabv3 for image segmentation and edge detection for accuracy.

Result: The app showed significant improvements in accuracy and reliability compared to standard clinical practices.

Conclusion: The app enhances TB diagnostics, especially in resource-limited areas. Future work will refine models and expand functionalities.

Abstract: This paper presents a newly developed mobile application designed to diagnose
Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI) using the Mantoux Skin Test (TST).
Traditional TST methods often suffer from low follow-up return rates, patient
discomfort, and subjective manual interpretation, particularly with the
ball-point pen method, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment. Moreover,
previous developed mobile applications that used 3D reconstruction, this app
utilizes scaling stickers as reference objects for induration measurement. This
mobile application integrates advanced image processing technologies, including
ARCore, and machine learning algorithms such as DeepLabv3 for robust image
segmentation and precise measurement of skin indurations indicative of LTBI.
The system employs an edge detection algorithm to enhance accuracy. The
application was evaluated against standard clinical practices, demonstrating
significant improvements in accuracy and reliability. This innovation is
crucial for effective tuberculosis management, especially in resource-limited
regions. By automating and standardizing TST evaluations, the application
enhances the accessibility and efficiency of TB di-agnostics. Future work will
focus on refining machine learning models, optimizing measurement algorithms,
expanding functionalities to include comprehensive patient data management, and
enhancing ARCore's performance across various lighting conditions and
operational settings.

*Xiangyuan Peng,Miao Tang,Huawei Sun,Bierzynski Kay,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion and cross-modal uncertainty to address misalignment and improve perception in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the strengths of LiDAR (spatial info) and 4D radar (velocity, robustness) while addressing their misalignment for better perception.

Method: Uses Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding for 4D radar feature extraction and instance-wise uncertainty estimation to refine LiDAR predictions.

Result: Achieves 74.89% mAP overall and 88.70% in driving corridor on VoD dataset, with real-time 30.02 FPS.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines 4D radar and LiDAR, improving detection accuracy and speed.

Abstract: LiDAR and 4D radar are widely used in autonomous driving and robotics. While
LiDAR provides rich spatial information, 4D radar offers velocity measurement
and remains robust under adverse conditions. As a result, increasing studies
have focused on the 4D radar-LiDAR fusion method to enhance the perception.
However, the misalignment between different modalities is often overlooked. To
address this challenge and leverage the strengths of both modalities, we
propose a LiDAR detection framework enhanced by 4D radar motion status and
cross-modal uncertainty. The object movement information from 4D radar is first
captured using a Dynamic Motion-Aware Encoding module during feature extraction
to enhance 4D radar predictions. Subsequently, the instance-wise uncertainties
of bounding boxes are estimated to mitigate the cross-modal misalignment and
refine the final LiDAR predictions. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft
(VoD) dataset highlight the effectiveness of our method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with the mAP of 74.89% in the entire area and
88.70% within the driving corridor while maintaining a real-time inference
speed of 30.02 FPS.

*Chenyue Song,Chen Hui,Wei Zhang,Haiqi Zhu,Shaohui Liu,Hong Huang,Feng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes BPCLIP, a bottom-up IQA method using CLIP to link low-level distortions with high-level semantics, achieving top performance on FR and NR benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IQA methods linearly fuse multiscale features, failing to capture distortion impacts on semantic content.

Method: BPCLIP uses a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module and CLIP text encoder with quality adjectives to link distortions and semantics.

Result: Superior performance on FR and NR IQA benchmarks with greater robustness.

Conclusion: BPCLIP effectively bridges low-level distortions and high-level semantics, enhancing IQA performance.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of
images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine
multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on
straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately
capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we
propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images
and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts
the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we
utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and
introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the
relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating
40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the
pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic
quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image
quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on
most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while
demonstrating greater robustness.

*Mischa Dombrowski,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for generating synthetic medical imaging data that ensures privacy by maximizing diversity, achieving performance close to real data while complying with legal regulations like GDPR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data in medical imaging is promising for privacy but faces legal and performance challenges. Current methods focus on diversity for better downstream performance but neglect privacy implications.

Method: The authors introduce a framework for training diffusion models on personal data to create unpersonal synthetic datasets, ensuring privacy through diversity maximization.

Result: The synthetic datasets achieve performance within one percentage point of real-data models and outperform non-privacy-preserving state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Maximizing diversity in synthetic data generation not only improves performance but also ensures privacy, making it a viable solution for medical imaging data sharing.

Abstract: Synthetic data has recently reached a level of visual fidelity that makes it
nearly indistinguishable from real data, offering great promise for
privacy-preserving data sharing in medical imaging. However, fully synthetic
datasets still suffer from significant limitations: First and foremost, the
legal aspect of sharing synthetic data is often neglected and data regulations,
such as the GDPR, are largley ignored. Secondly, synthetic models fall short of
matching the performance of real data, even for in-domain downstream
applications. Recent methods for image generation have focused on maximising
image diversity instead of fidelity solely to improve the mode coverage and
therefore the downstream performance of synthetic data. In this work, we shift
perspective and highlight how maximizing diversity can also be interpreted as
protecting natural persons from being singled out, which leads to predicate
singling-out (PSO) secure synthetic datasets. Specifically, we propose a
generalisable framework for training diffusion models on personal data which
leads to unpersonal synthetic datasets achieving performance within one
percentage point of real-data models while significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods that do not ensure privacy. Our code is available at

Conclusion: The framework provides a fast and reliable solution for real-time human motion capture.

Abstract: Markerless motion capture enables the tracking of human motion without

TL;DR: OSDMamba, a Mamba-based model for oil spill detection, addresses class imbalance and small area detection challenges, outperforming CNNs with 8.9% and 11.8% improvements on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labelled samples and class imbalance in oil spill detection reduce accuracy. CNNs struggle with small areas and global context.

Method: Proposes OSDMamba, using Mamba's selective scanning for wider receptive fields and an asymmetric decoder with ConvSSM for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection by 8.9% and 11.8% on two datasets.

Conclusion: Mamba-based models like OSDMamba effectively address oil spill detection challenges, offering superior performance over CNNs.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is commonly used for Oil Spill Detection (OSD) in
remote sensing images. However, the limited availability of labelled oil spill
samples and class imbalance present significant challenges that can reduce
detection accuracy. Furthermore, most existing methods, which rely on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to detect small oil spill areas
due to their limited receptive fields and inability to effectively capture
global contextual information. This study explores the potential of State-Space
Models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, to overcome these limitations, building on
their recent success in vision applications. We propose OSDMamba, the first
Mamba-based architecture specifically designed for oil spill detection.
OSDMamba leverages Mamba's selective scanning mechanism to effectively expand
the model's receptive field while preserving critical details. Moreover, we
designed an asymmetric decoder incorporating ConvSSM and deep supervision to
strengthen multi-scale feature fusion, thereby enhancing the model's
sensitivity to minority class samples. Experimental results show that the
proposed OSDMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding improvements
of 8.9% and 11.8% in OSD across two publicly available datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection models perform poorly under practical scenarios with distribution shifts, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: The authors propose a robustness evaluation benchmark, analyze 40+ HOI models, and introduce cross-domain data augmentation with mixup and feature fusion using frozen vision foundation models.

Result: The proposed methods significantly improve model robustness, with benefits extending to standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work provides practical solutions to enhance HOI detection robustness, supported by a new benchmark and open-source resources.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has seen substantial advances in
recent years. However, existing works focus on the standard setting with ideal
images and natural distribution, far from practical scenarios with inevitable
distribution shifts. This hampers the practical applicability of HOI detection.
In this work, we investigate this issue by benchmarking, analyzing, and
enhancing the robustness of HOI detection models under various distribution
shifts. We start by proposing a novel automated approach to create the first
robustness evaluation benchmark for HOI detection. Subsequently, we evaluate
more than 40 existing HOI detection models on this benchmark, showing their
insufficiency, analyzing the features of different frameworks, and discussing
how the robustness in HOI is different from other tasks. With the insights from
such analyses, we propose to improve the robustness of HOI detection methods
through: (1) a cross-domain data augmentation integrated with mixup, and (2) a
feature fusion strategy with frozen vision foundation models. Both are simple,
plug-and-play, and applicable to various methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly increases the robustness
of various methods, with benefits on standard benchmarks, too. The dataset and

Abstract: This report introduces PP-DocBee2, an advanced version of the PP-DocBee,
designed to enhance multimodal document understanding. Built on a large
multimodal model architecture, PP-DocBee2 addresses the limitations of its
predecessor through key technological improvements, including enhanced

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiCo is a novel MIL framework for histopathology WSI analysis, addressing spatial heterogeneity by clustering instances and enhancing cross-regional correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial heterogeneity in WSIs makes it hard for conventional MIL methods to model scattered tissue distributions and cross-regional interactions.

Method: MiCo clusters instances into semantic anchors, uses a Cluster Route module for intra-tissue correlations, and a Cluster Reducer for inter-tissue associations.

Result: MiCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nine cancer datasets.

Conclusion: MiCo effectively addresses spatial heterogeneity in WSIs, improving cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown significant promise in
histopathology whole slide image (WSI) analysis for cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. However, the inherent spatial heterogeneity of WSIs presents
critical challenges, as morphologically similar tissue types are often
dispersed across distant anatomical regions. Conventional MIL methods struggle
to model these scattered tissue distributions and capture cross-regional
spatial interactions effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel Multiple instance learning framework with Context-Aware Clustering
(MiCo), designed to enhance cross-regional intra-tissue correlations and
strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations in WSIs. MiCo begins by
clustering instances to distill discriminative morphological patterns, with
cluster centroids serving as semantic anchors. To enhance cross-regional
intra-tissue correlations, MiCo employs a Cluster Route module, which
dynamically links instances of the same tissue type across distant regions via
feature similarity. These semantic anchors act as contextual hubs, propagating
semantic relationships to refine instance-level representations. To eliminate
semantic fragmentation and strengthen inter-tissue semantic associations, MiCo
integrates a Cluster Reducer module, which consolidates redundant anchors while
enhancing information exchange between distinct semantic groups. Extensive
experiments on two challenging tasks across nine large-scale public cancer
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MiCo, showcasing its superiority over
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

layer can process visual tokens for medical image segmentation tasks.
Specifically, we propose a simple hybrid structure that integrates a
pre-trained, frozen LLM layer within the CNN encoder-decoder segmentation
framework (LLM4Seg). Surprisingly, this design improves segmentation
performance with a minimal increase in trainable parameters across various
modalities, including ultrasound, dermoscopy, polypscopy, and CT scans. Our
in-depth analysis reveals the potential of transferring LLM's semantic
awareness to enhance segmentation tasks, offering both improved global
understanding and better local modeling capabilities. The improvement proves
robust across different LLMs, validated using LLaMA and DeepSeek.

*Dongdong Meng,Sheng Li,Hao Wu,Suqing Tian,Wenjun Ma,Guoping Wang,Xueqing Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CmFNet is a 3D weakly supervised cross-modal medical image segmentation method that improves performance by integrating multi-modal data and hybrid supervision, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality medical image annotations are costly and time-consuming, while weakly supervised methods face performance degradation and overfitting issues.

Method: CmFNet combines modality-specific and cross-modal feature learning networks with a hybrid-supervised strategy (scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, inter-modal consistency).

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and even fully supervised methods when full annotations are used, excelling in segmenting small tumors and common structures.

Conclusion: CmFNet effectively addresses overfitting and performance degradation, offering robust segmentation for clinical applications across specialties.

Abstract: Accurate automatic medical image segmentation relies on high-quality, dense
annotations, which are costly and time-consuming. Weakly supervised learning
provides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse
annotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance
degradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.
To address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised
cross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main
components: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature
learning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the
modality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning
network effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal
images, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation
performance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides
segmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and
inter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while
promoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,
delivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both
challenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures. Extensive
experiments on a clinical cross-modal nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) dataset
(including CT and MR imaging) and the publicly available CT Whole Abdominal
Organ dataset (WORD) show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly
supervised methods. In addition, our approach also outperforms fully supervised
methods when full annotation is used. Our approach can facilitate clinical
therapy and benefit various specialists, including physicists, radiologists,
pathologists, and oncologists.

### [74] [CLGRPO: Reasoning Ability Enhancement for Small VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18048)
*Fanyi Wang,Binzhi Dong,Haotian Hu,Jinjin Xu,Zhiwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Incremental Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) using self-supervised COT data and multi-stage optimization, achieving performance comparable to larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVLMs (â¤2B parameters) have commercial value due to low cost but suffer from limited reasoning abilities. This work aims to improve their reasoning without increasing parameter size.

Method: A four-stage Incremental Training Strategy: (1) SFT on COT data, (2) GRPO for format alignment, (3) GRPO for reasoning enhancement, (4) CLGRPO to address capacity limits. Uses self-supervised COT data from larger models.

Result: Significant improvement in reasoning: accuracy +2.77, recall +0.69 on EMOSet-118K, matching 8B model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively enhances SVLM reasoning, demonstrating feasibility of optimizing small models to compete with larger ones.

Abstract: Small Vision Language Models (SVLMs) generally refer to models with parameter
sizes less than or equal to 2B. Their low cost and power consumption
characteristics confer high commercial value. However, their reasoning
abilities are limited by the number of parameters. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a post-training optimization paradigm called the Incremental
Training Strategy to enhance the reasoning ability of SVLMs. Firstly, we
constructed a Self-Supervised Chain-of-Thought (COT) Data Construction System,
which leverages multiple LVLMs with 7B parameters or more to transform original
data into COT data in a self-supervised manner. Our proposed Incremental
Training Strategy consists of four stages. Stage 1 injects domain knowledge by
performing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to the pretrained model on the COT
data. Stage 2 aligns the COT data format by conducting a small amount of Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) training constrained only by format rewards
on the COT data. Stage 3 enhances reasoning ability by applying GRPO training
on the COT data with constraints on both format and accuracy rewards. The
resulting model shows significant improvement compared to the baseline. Stage 4
addresses the limited capacity of the SVLMs and the weak ability to capture
complex patterns by proposing ClipLow GRPO (CLGRPO) to constrain the capture
space of the training process. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation
experiments on the abstract semantic recognition dataset EMOSet-118K.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the
reasoning ability of 1B SVLM. Compared to the baseline model fine-tuned on the
original data, accuracy increased by 2.77 and recall by 0.69, achieving
performance comparable to that of 8B models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural network approach using DINOv2 and LSTM for estimating wheat spike volumes from 2D RGB images outperforms traditional methods, achieving a MAPE of 6.46%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in estimating 3D traits from 2D images due to depth loss, distortions, and occlusions in field conditions.

Method: Proposes a transfer learning pipeline combining DINOv2 (self-supervised Vision Transformer) with LSTM, using deep supervision for robust representations.

Result: Achieves MAPE of 6.46% (indoor) and 10.82% (field), outperforming area-based (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines.

Conclusion: Deep learning outperforms geometric methods, especially for irregular shapes like wheat spikes.

Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional morphological traits from two-dimensional RGB
images presents inherent challenges due to the loss of depth information,
projection distortions, and occlusions under field conditions. In this work, we
explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat
spikes, using RGB image sequences and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth
references. Due to the complex geometry of the spikes, we propose a neural
network approach for volume estimation in 2D images, employing a transfer
learning pipeline that combines DINOv2, a self-supervised Vision Transformer,
with a unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. By using deep
supervision, the model is able to learn more robust intermediate
representations, which enhances its generalisation ability across varying
evaluation sequences. We benchmark our model against two conventional
baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using
axis-aligned cross-sections. Our deep supervised model achieves a mean absolute
percentage error (MAPE) of 6.46% on six-view indoor images, outperforming the
area (9.36%) and geometric (13.98%) baselines. Fine-tuning the model on
field-based single-image data enables domain adaptation, yielding a MAPE of
10.82%. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume
prediction accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing
greater challenges for geometric methods compared to our deep learning
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training-free method to improve out-of-domain performance of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) in medical image classification by identifying and adjusting confounding and discriminative concepts using minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in deploying CBMs across diverse clinical environments due to concept-level shifts and the high cost of expert-annotated concept labels.

Method: A training-free confusion concept identification strategy using minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with image-level labels, masking misactivated concepts and amplifying under-activated ones.

Result: Validated on skin and white blood cell images, the method enhances out-of-domain performance without compromising source domain accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves CBM deployment in new environments without requiring costly concept annotations.

Abstract: Deep learning-based medical image classification techniques are rapidly
advancing in medical image analysis, making it crucial to develop accurate and
trustworthy models that can be efficiently deployed across diverse clinical
scenarios. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which first predict a set of
explainable concepts from images and then perform classification based on these
concepts, are increasingly being adopted for explainable medical image
classification. However, the inherent explainability of CBMs introduces new
challenges when deploying trained models to new environments. Variations in
imaging protocols and staining methods may induce concept-level shifts, such as
alterations in color distribution and scale. Furthermore, since CBM training
requires explicit concept annotations, fine-tuning models solely with
image-level labels could compromise concept prediction accuracy and
faithfulness - a critical limitation given the high cost of acquiring
expert-annotated concept labels in medical domains. To address these
challenges, we propose a training-free confusion concept identification
strategy. By leveraging minimal new data (e.g., 4 images per class) with only
image-level labels, our approach enhances out-of-domain performance without
sacrificing source domain accuracy through two key operations: masking
misactivated confounding concepts and amplifying under-activated discriminative
concepts. The efficacy of our method is validated on both skin and white blood
cell images. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: MUPA is a multi-path agentic approach for Grounded VideoQA, improving grounding fidelity and answer accuracy by unifying video grounding, QA, reflection, and aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern multimodal models rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, leading to poorly grounded predictions in Grounded VideoQA.

Method: MUPA uses three reasoning paths involving grounding and QA agents, along with a reflection agent to judge and aggregate results.

Result: MUPA outperforms 7B-scale competitors with 2B parameters and achieves state-of-the-art results (30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and DeVE-QA) when scaled to 7B.

Conclusion: MUPA effectively enhances trustworthy video-language understanding by improving grounding fidelity without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Grounded Video Question Answering (Grounded VideoQA) requires aligning
textual answers with explicit visual evidence. However, modern multimodal
models often rely on linguistic priors and spurious correlations, resulting in
poorly grounded predictions. In this work, we propose MUPA, a cooperative
MUlti-Path Agentic approach that unifies video grounding, question answering,
answer reflection and aggregation to tackle Grounded VideoQA. MUPA features
three distinct reasoning paths on the interplay of grounding and QA agents in
different chronological orders, along with a dedicated reflection agent to
judge and aggregate the multi-path results to accomplish consistent QA and
grounding. This design markedly improves grounding fidelity without sacrificing
answer accuracy. Despite using only 2B parameters, our method outperforms all
7B-scale competitors. When scaled to 7B parameters, MUPA establishes new
state-of-the-art results, with Acc@GQA of 30.3% and 47.4% on NExT-GQA and
DeVE-QA respectively, demonstrating MUPA' effectiveness towards trustworthy
video-language understanding. Our code is available in

TL;DR: TEM^3-Learning is a novel MTL framework for assistive driving, combining efficient multimodal feature extraction and task-specific gating to achieve high accuracy and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTL methods for assistive driving are limited by single-modality constraints and inefficient architectures, hindering comprehensive scene understanding and real-time deployment.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: MTS-Mamba for efficient temporal-spatial feature extraction and MGMI for adaptive multimodal feature integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four tasks, with a lightweight model (<6M parameters) and 142.32 FPS speed.

Conclusion: TEM^3-Learning effectively addresses MTL limitations, offering high performance and efficiency for assistive driving applications.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) can advance assistive driving by exploring
inter-task correlations through shared representations. However, existing
methods face two critical limitations: single-modality constraints limiting
comprehensive scene understanding and inefficient architectures impeding
real-time deployment. This paper proposes TEM^3-Learning (Time-Efficient
Multimodal Multi-task Learning), a novel framework that jointly optimizes
driver emotion recognition, driver behavior recognition, traffic context
recognition, and vehicle behavior recognition through a two-stage architecture.
The first component, the mamba-based multi-view temporal-spatial feature
extraction subnetwork (MTS-Mamba), introduces a forward-backward temporal
scanning mechanism and global-local spatial attention to efficiently extract
low-cost temporal-spatial features from multi-view sequential images. The
second component, the MTL-based gated multimodal feature integrator (MGMI),
employs task-specific multi-gating modules to adaptively highlight the most
relevant modality features for each task, effectively alleviating the negative
transfer problem in MTL. Evaluation on the AIDE dataset, our proposed model
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across all four tasks, maintaining a
lightweight architecture with fewer than 6 million parameters and delivering an
impressive 142.32 FPS inference speed. Rigorous ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the independent
contributions of each module. The code is available on

Motivation: To make photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation accessible, as proprietary systems like GPT-4o-Image are unavailable.

Method: Created ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset (45K text-to-image, 46K text-and-image-to-image) using GPT-4o. Trained Janus-4o model on this dataset.

Result: Janus-4o outperforms Janus-Pro in text-to-image and supports text-and-image-to-image generation, achieving strong results with 91K samples and 6 hours of training.

Conclusion: ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o advance open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal generative models have unlocked photorealistic,
instruction-aligned image generation, yet leading systems like GPT-4o-Image
remain proprietary and inaccessible. To democratize these capabilities, we
present ShareGPT-4o-Image, the first dataset comprising 45K text-to-image and
46K text-and-image-to-image data, all synthesized using GPT-4o's image
generation capabilities for distilling its advanced image generation abilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we develop Janus-4o, a multimodal large language model
capable of both text-to-image and text-and-image-to-image generation. Janus-4o
not only significantly improves text-to-image generation over its predecessor,
Janus-Pro, but also newly supports text-and-image-to-image generation. Notably,
it achieves impressive performance in text-and-image-to-image generation from
scratch, using only 91K synthetic samples and 6 hours of training on an 8
A800-GPU machine. We hope the release of ShareGPT-4o-Image and Janus-4o will
foster open research in photorealistic, instruction-aligned image generation.

### [80] [Enhancing VICReg: Random-Walk Pairing for Improved Generalization and Better Global Semantics Capturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18104)
*Idan Simai,Ronen Talmon,Uri Shaham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAG-VICReg improves VICReg by enhancing generalization and global semantics, outperforming SSL baselines and introducing a new evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VICReg may generalize poorly due to overreliance on training data, prompting the need for a more robust method.

Method: Introduces SAG-VICReg, which enhances VICReg with new training techniques to improve global semantics and generalization.

Result: SAG-VICReg outperforms SSL baselines, excels in global semantic understanding, and maintains local performance.

Conclusion: SAG-VICReg effectively addresses generalization issues and introduces a label-free evaluation metric for embeddings.

Abstract: In this paper, we argue that viewing VICReg-a popular self-supervised
learning (SSL) method--through the lens of spectral embedding reveals a
potential source of sub-optimality: it may struggle to generalize robustly to
unseen data due to overreliance on the training data. This observation invites
a closer look at how well this method achieves its goal of producing meaningful
representations of images outside of the training set as well. Here, we
investigate this issue and introduce SAG-VICReg (Stable and Generalizable
VICReg), a method that builds on VICReg by incorporating new training
techniques. These enhancements improve the model's ability to capture global
semantics within the data and strengthen the generalization capabilities.
Experiments demonstrate that SAG-VICReg effectively addresses the
generalization challenge while matching or surpassing diverse state-of-the-art
SSL baselines. Notably, our method exhibits superior performance on metrics
designed to evaluate global semantic understanding, while simultaneously
maintaining competitive results on local evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we
propose a new standalone evaluation metric for embeddings that complements the
standard evaluation methods and accounts for the global data structure without
requiring labels--a key issue when tagged data is scarce or not available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an adversarial diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives for polyp detection, improving detector performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in current methods that overlook false positives in polyp detection by enhancing data diversity and reliability.

Method: Introduces a regional noise matching strategy and a Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module to synthesize high-value false positives.

Result: Improves detector performance by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score on public and in-house datasets.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis, enhancing reliability in colorectal cancer screening.

Abstract: Polyp detection is crucial for colorectal cancer screening, yet existing
models are limited by the scale and diversity of available data. While
generative models show promise for data augmentation, current methods mainly
focus on enhancing polyp diversity, often overlooking the critical issue of
false positives. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an adversarial
diffusion framework to synthesize high-value false positives. The extensive
variability of negative backgrounds presents a significant challenge in false
positive synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce two key innovations: First,
we design a regional noise matching strategy to construct a negative synthesis
space using polyp detection datasets. This strategy trains a negative-centric
diffusion model by masking polyp regions, ensuring the model focuses
exclusively on learning diverse background patterns. Second, we introduce the
Detector-guided Adversarial Diffusion Attacker (DADA) module, which perturbs
the negative synthesis process to disrupt a pre-trained detector's decision,
guiding the negative-centric diffusion model to generate high-value,
detector-confusing false positives instead of low-value, ordinary backgrounds.
Our approach is the first to apply adversarial diffusion to lesion detection,
establishing a new paradigm for targeted false positive synthesis and paving
the way for more reliable clinical applications in colorectal cancer screening.
Extensive results on public and in-house datasets verify the superiority of our
method over the current state-of-the-arts, with our synthesized data improving
the detectors by at least 2.6% and 2.7% in F1-score, respectively, over the
baselines. Codes are at https://github.com/Huster-Hq/DADA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing medical vision-language models (VLMs) by integrating comparative reasoning using reference images, improving diagnostic accuracy over single-image methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging diagnosis is challenging due to diseases mimicking normal anatomy and variability. Existing VLMs lack comparative reasoning, while general-purpose VLMs lack medical-domain knowledge.

Method: The work leverages reference images and clinically-informed prompts in VLMs, with supervised finetuning (SFT), to improve diagnostic outcomes.

Result: Comparative analysis with reference images significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, especially after SFT, across medical VQA tasks.

Conclusion: The study highlights the clinical value of comparative reasoning in VLMs, introduces novel strategies for reference image use, and demonstrates performance gains in medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Medical imaging diagnosis presents inherent challenges due to diseases that
mimic normal anatomy and exhibit significant inter-patient variability.
Clinicians routinely employ comparative reasoning-using reference images from
healthy controls or previous patient examinations-to discern subtle yet
diagnostically critical abnormalities. However, existing medical
vision-language models (VLMs) focus primarily on single-image or single-series
analyses and lack explicit mechanisms for comparative reasoning. Conversely,
general-purpose VLMs demonstrate strong multi-image comparative reasoning
capabilities but lack essential medical-domain knowledge to identify nuanced
clinical differences. This work aims to bridge this gap by exploring
clinically-inspired comparative analysis within VLMs, leveraging reference
images to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Through extensive empirical analysis, we
show that providing general-purpose VLMs with query and normative matched
reference images, accompanied by clinically-informed comparative prompts,
significantly improves diagnostic outcomes compared to single-image baselines,
especially after supervised finetuning (SFT). Our contributions highlight the
clinical relevance of comparative analysis introduce novel strategies for
leveraging reference images in VLMs, empirically demonstrate enhanced
performance across multiple medical visual question answering (VQA) tasks, and
provide theoretical insights into the efficacy of comparative image analysis in
medical diagnosis.

TL;DR: A post-processing method using CNNs for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry, achieving high accuracy (95-100%) in detecting and classifying particles and bubbles/droplets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of distinguishing tracer particles from dispersed phase particles (bubbles/droplets) in two-phase flows using a single-camera setup.

Method: Uses convolutional neural networks (Faster R-CNN, YOLOv4) trained on auto-labeled datasets generated by a GAN framework to detect and classify particles based on defocused image patterns.

Result: Achieves high precision and accuracy (95-100%) in phase separation across synthetic and real datasets, even under domain shifts.

Conclusion: CNNs are viable for robust phase separation in two-phase DPTV, outperforming traditional methods in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: This work investigates the feasibility of a post-processing-based approach
for phase separation in defocusing particle tracking velocimetry for dispersed
two-phase flows. The method enables the simultaneous 3D localization
determination of both tracer particles and particles of the dispersed phase,
using a single-camera setup. The distinction between phases is based on pattern
differences in defocused particle images, which arise from distinct light
scattering behaviors of tracer particles and bubbles or droplets. Convolutional
neural networks, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv4 variants, are trained to
detect and classify particle images based on these pattern features. To
generate large, labeled training datasets, a generative adversarial network
based framework is introduced, allowing the generation of auto-labeled data
that more closely reflects experiment-specific visual appearance. Evaluation
across six datasets, comprising synthetic two-phase and real single- and
two-phase flows, demonstrates high detection precision and classification
accuracy (95-100%), even under domain shifts. The results confirm the viability
of using CNNs for robust phase separation in disperse two-phase DPTV,
particularly in scenarios where traditional wavelength-, size-, or ensemble
correlation-based methods are impractical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation for dense correspondences is tedious and unscalable, and existing self-supervised methods struggle with limited training data diversity.

Method: CDG-MAE generates diverse synthetic views from static images using an image-conditioned diffusion model and employs a multi-anchor MAE strategy.

Result: CDG-MAE outperforms state-of-the-art image-based MAE methods and reduces the performance gap with video-based approaches.

Conclusion: Synthetic views from diffusion models enhance self-supervised learning for dense correspondences, offering a scalable alternative to video datasets.

Abstract: Learning dense correspondences, critical for application such as video label
propagation, is hindered by tedious and unscalable manual annotation.
Self-supervised methods address this by using a cross-view pretext task, often
modeled with a masked autoencoder, where a masked target view is reconstructed
from an anchor view. However, acquiring effective training data remains a
challenge - collecting diverse video datasets is difficult and costly, while
simple image crops lack necessary pose variations. This paper introduces
CDG-MAE, a novel MAE-based self-supervised method that uses diverse synthetic
views generated from static images via an image-conditioned diffusion model.
These generated views exhibit substantial changes in pose and perspective,
providing a rich training signal that overcomes the limitations of video and
crop-based anchors. We present a quantitative method to evaluate local and
global consistency of generated images, discussing their use for cross-view
self-supervised pretraining. Furthermore, we enhance the standard single-anchor
MAE setting to a multi-anchor strategy to effectively modulate the difficulty
of pretext task. CDG-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MAE methods
reliant only on images and substantially narrows the performance gap to
video-based approaches.

TL;DR: The paper introduces STACT-Time, a deep learning model for thyroid cancer risk stratification using US cine clips and segmentation masks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce unnecessary biopsies of benign thyroid nodules and improve malignancy prediction by leveraging dynamic US cine clips and segmentation masks.

Method: Proposes STACT-Time, a framework combining self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to integrate spatial-temporal features from US cine clips and segmentation masks.

Result: Achieves precision of 0.91 (Â±0.02) and F1 score of 0.89 (Â±0.02), outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: STACT-Time enhances clinical decision-making by reducing benign biopsies while maintaining high malignancy detection sensitivity.

Abstract: Thyroid cancer is among the most common cancers in the United States. Thyroid
nodules are frequently detected through ultrasound (US) imaging, and some
require further evaluation via fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Despite its
effectiveness, FNA often leads to unnecessary biopsies of benign nodules,
causing patient discomfort and anxiety. To address this, the American College
of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) has been
developed to reduce benign biopsies. However, such systems are limited by
interobserver variability. Recent deep learning approaches have sought to
improve risk stratification, but they often fail to utilize the rich temporal
and spatial context provided by US cine clips, which contain dynamic global
information and surrounding structural changes across various views. In this
work, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Cross Attention for Cine Thyroid
Ultrasound Time Series Classification (STACT-Time) model, a novel
representation learning framework that integrates imaging features from US cine
clips with features from segmentation masks automatically generated by a
pretrained model. By leveraging self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms,
our model captures the rich temporal and spatial context of US cine clips while
enhancing feature representation through segmentation-guided learning. Our
model improves malignancy prediction compared to state-of-the-art models,
achieving a cross-validation precision of 0.91 (plus or minus 0.02) and an F1
score of 0.89 (plus or minus 0.02). By reducing unnecessary biopsies of benign
nodules while maintaining high sensitivity for malignancy detection, our model
has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient
outcomes.

Method: DExNet uses domain-adapted pre-trained CNNs to extract features, fuses them via a Feature Fusion Block, and classifies using Bi-LSTM layers. Evaluated on tomato leaf images with varying shot counts.

Result: Achieves accuracies of 89.06% (5-shot), 92.46% (10-shot), 94.07% (15-shot), and 98.09% (80-shot), reducing data needs by 94.5% while nearing state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DExNet outperforms existing methods in limited-data scenarios across single-, mixed-, and cross-domain conditions, proving effective for plant disease classification with scarce data.

Abstract: While deep learning-based architectures have been widely used for correctly
detecting and classifying plant diseases, they require large-scale datasets to
learn generalized features and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This poses
a challenge for such models to obtain satisfactory performance in classifying
leaf diseases with limited samples. This work proposes a few-shot learning
framework, Domain-adapted Expert Network (DExNet), for plant disease
classification that compensates for the lack of sufficient training data by
combining observations of a number of expert critics. It starts with extracting
the feature embeddings as 'observations' from nine 'critics' that are
state-of-the-art pre-trained CNN-based architectures. These critics are 'domain
adapted' using a publicly available leaf disease dataset having no overlapping
classes with the specific downstream task of interest. The observations are
then passed to the 'Feature Fusion Block' and finally to a classifier network
consisting of Bi-LSTM layers. The proposed pipeline is evaluated on the 10
classes of tomato leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, achieving
promising accuracies of 89.06%, 92.46%, and 94.07%, respectively, for 5-shot,
10-shot, and 15-shot classification. Furthermore, an accuracy of 98.09+-0.7%
has been achieved in 80-shot classification, which is only 1.2% less than
state-of-the-art, allowing a 94.5% reduction in the training data requirement.
The proposed pipeline also outperforms existing works on leaf disease
classification with limited data in both laboratory and real-life conditions in
single-domain, mixed-domain, and cross-domain scenarios.

*Youjie Zhou,Guofeng Mei,Yiming Wang,Yi Wan,Fabio Poiesi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMF-SLAM is an efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method using FFT and novel attention mechanisms to improve performance in noisy, varying lighting, and dark conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in visual SLAM due to noise, lighting variations, and darkness, along with high computational demands of traditional methods.

Method: Proposes FMF-SLAM with Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention for RGB/depth feature extraction, multi-scale knowledge distillation, and integration with GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.

Result: Validated on TUM, TartanAir, and real-world datasets, showing state-of-the-art performance in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: FMF-SLAM is efficient, practical, and performs well in real-world scenarios with real-time capabilities.

Abstract: Visual SLAM is particularly challenging in environments affected by noise,
varying lighting conditions, and darkness. Learning-based optical flow
algorithms can leverage multiple modalities to address these challenges, but
traditional optical flow-based visual SLAM approaches often require significant
computational resources.To overcome this limitation, we propose FMF-SLAM, an
efficient multimodal fusion SLAM method that utilizes fast Fourier transform
(FFT) to enhance the algorithm efficiency. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Fourier-based self-attention and cross-attention mechanism to extract features
from RGB and depth signals. We further enhance the interaction of multimodal
features by incorporating multi-scale knowledge distillation across modalities.
We also demonstrate the practical feasibility of FMF-SLAM in real-world
scenarios with real time performance by integrating it with a security robot by
fusing with a global positioning module GNSS-RTK and global Bundle Adjustment.
Our approach is validated using video sequences from TUM, TartanAir, and our
real-world datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art performance under noisy,
varying lighting, and dark conditions.Our code and datasets are available at

*Ankit Sanjyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO-enhanced NeRF models underperform baseline NeRF in few-shot 3D reconstruction, suggesting pre-trained vision features may introduce harmful biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrating pre-trained DINO features into NeRF for few-shot 3D scene reconstruction.

Method: Systematic comparison of baseline NeRF, frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: All DINO variants performed worse (PSNR 12.9-13.0) than baseline NeRF (PSNR 14.71).

Conclusion: Pre-trained vision features may not aid few-shot reconstruction; simpler geometric-focused architectures could be more effective.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have revolutionized 3D scene reconstruction
from sparse image collections. Recent work has explored integrating pre-trained
vision features, particularly from DINO, to enhance few-shot reconstruction
capabilities. However, the effectiveness of such approaches remains unclear,
especially in extreme few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we present a
systematic evaluation of DINO-enhanced NeRF models, comparing baseline NeRF,
frozen DINO features, LoRA fine-tuned features, and multi-scale feature fusion.
Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that all DINO variants perform worse than
the baseline NeRF, achieving PSNR values around 12.9 to 13.0 compared to the
baseline's 14.71. This counterintuitive result suggests that pre-trained vision
features may not be beneficial for few-shot 3D reconstruction and may even
introduce harmful biases. We analyze potential causes including feature-task
mismatch, overfitting to limited data, and integration challenges. Our findings
challenge common assumptions in the field and suggest that simpler
architectures focusing on geometric consistency may be more effective for
few-shot scenarios.

*Zhisen Hu,Dominic Cullen,Peter Thompson,David Johnson,Chang Bian,Aleksei Tiulpin,Timothy Cootes,Claudia Lindner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning method using hourglass networks and attention gates automates knee alignment measurement in radiographs, achieving high accuracy (~1Â° difference) and reliability (ICC up to 0.97).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional manual KA measurements are time-consuming and require long-leg radiographs. Automating this process can improve efficiency and accuracy.

Method: The study employs hourglass networks with attention gates to localize over 100 knee landmarks and measure KA using the tibiofemoral angle, validated on pre- and post-operative images.

Result: The method achieves ~1Â° mean absolute difference from clinical measurements, with excellent pre-operative (ICC=0.97) and good post-operative (ICC=0.86) agreement.

Conclusion: Automated KA assessment is highly accurate and reliable, offering potential for enhanced clinical workflows.

Abstract: Radiographic knee alignment (KA) measurement is important for predicting
joint health and surgical outcomes after total knee replacement. Traditional
methods for KA measurements are manual, time-consuming and require long-leg
radiographs. This study proposes a deep learning-based method to measure KA in
anteroposterior knee radiographs via automatically localized knee anatomical
landmarks. Our method builds on hourglass networks and incorporates an
attention gate structure to enhance robustness and focus on key anatomical
features. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based method to
localize over 100 knee anatomical landmarks to fully outline the knee shape
while integrating KA measurements on both pre-operative and post-operative
images. It provides highly accurate and reliable anatomical varus/valgus KA
measurements using the anatomical tibiofemoral angle, achieving mean absolute
differences ~1{\deg} when compared to clinical ground truth measurements.
Agreement between automated and clinical measurements was excellent
pre-operatively (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.97) and good
post-operatively (ICC = 0.86). Our findings demonstrate that KA assessment can
be automated with high accuracy, creating opportunities for digitally enhanced
clinical workflows.

*Kazuma Kitazawa,Tsuyoshi Takatani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for accurate shape estimation of transparent objects using Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) Shape from Polarization (SfP), addressing prior errors with a new polarization model and learning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LWIR SfP methods had significant errors due to inadequate polarimetric modeling, especially neglecting reflection, which this work aims to correct.

Method: The authors developed a polarization model accounting for emission and reflection, used model-based and learning-based approaches for surface normal estimation, and created a synthetic dataset. They also modeled the LWIR imaging process to correct systematic errors.

Result: The method achieved high accuracy and broad applicability, validated by experiments and the creation of the ThermoPol benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed LWIR SfP method, with its improved modeling and learning-based approach, accurately estimates shapes of transparent and other materials, demonstrated by real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Shape estimation for transparent objects is challenging due to their complex
light transport. To circumvent these difficulties, we leverage the Shape from
Polarization (SfP) technique in the Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) spectrum, where
most materials are opaque and emissive. While a few prior studies have explored
LWIR SfP, these attempts suffered from significant errors due to inadequate
polarimetric modeling, particularly the neglect of reflection. Addressing this
gap, we formulated a polarization model that explicitly accounts for the
combined effects of emission and reflection. Based on this model, we estimated
surface normals using not only a direct model-based method but also a
learning-based approach employing a neural network trained on a
physically-grounded synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we modeled the LWIR
polarimetric imaging process, accounting for inherent systematic errors to
ensure accurate polarimetry. We implemented a prototype system and created
ThermoPol, the first real-world benchmark dataset for LWIR SfP. Through
comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated the high accuracy and broad
applicability of our method across various materials, including those
transparent in the visible spectrum.

### [91] [Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (KD) for Retinal Fundus Image Anomaly Detection on NVIDIA Jetson Nano](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18220)
*Berk Yilmaz,Aniruddh Aiyengar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a lightweight, edge-device deployable retinal disease classifier using knowledge distillation from a high-capacity ViT teacher model to a CNN-based student model, achieving 89% classification accuracy with 93% retention of the teacher's performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of dependable diagnostic devices in low-resourced settings by developing an accessible, scalable AI-driven solution for early retinal disease identification.

Method: A ViT teacher model is pre-trained with I-JEPA self-supervised learning and distilled into a CNN-based student model using a novel framework with Partitioned Cross-Attention (PCA) and Group-Wise Linear (GL) projectors, and multi-view robust training.

Result: The student model achieves 89% classification accuracy, retaining 93% of the teacher model's diagnostic performance, despite having 97.4% fewer parameters.

Conclusion: The method successfully compresses the ViT model while retaining accuracy, offering a scalable AI solution for retinal disorder triage in under-resourced areas.

Abstract: Early and accurate identification of retinal ailments is crucial for averting
ocular decline; however, access to dependable diagnostic devices is not often
available in low-resourced settings. This project proposes to solve that by
developing a lightweight, edge-device deployable disease classifier using
cross-architecture knowledge distilling. We first train a high-capacity vision
transformer (ViT) teacher model, pre-trained using I-JEPA self-supervised
learning, to classify fundus images into four classes: Normal, Diabetic
Retinopathy, Glaucoma, and Cataract. We kept an Internet of Things (IoT) focus
when compressing to a CNN-based student model for deployment in
resource-limited conditions, such as the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. This was
accomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned
Cross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a
multi-view robust training method. The teacher model has 97.4 percent more
parameters than the student model, with it achieving 89 percent classification
with a roughly 93 percent retention of the teacher model's diagnostic
performance. The retention of clinical classification behavior supports our
method's initial aim: compression of the ViT while retaining accuracy. Our work
serves as an example of a scalable, AI-driven triage solution for retinal
disorders in under-resourced areas.

*Xunzhi Xiang,Qi Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA), a training-free method to optimize context in autoregressive image generation, reducing memory and computational overhead while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the memory and computational inefficiencies in autoregressive image generation caused by long contexts during inference.

Method: Proposes ADSA, which dynamically identifies crucial historical tokens for local texture and global semantics, and introduces a dynamic KV-cache update mechanism.

Result: Reduces GPU memory consumption by ~50% while maintaining generation quality, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ADSA effectively balances resource efficiency and generation quality in autoregressive image synthesis.

Abstract: Autoregressive conditional image generation models have emerged as a dominant
paradigm in text-to-image synthesis. These methods typically convert images
into one-dimensional token sequences and leverage the self-attention mechanism,
which has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, to
capture long-range dependencies, model global context, and ensure semantic
coherence. However, excessively long contexts during inference lead to
significant memory overhead caused by KV-cache and computational delays. To
alleviate these challenges, we systematically analyze how global semantics,
spatial layouts, and fine-grained textures are formed during inference, and
propose a novel training-free context optimization method called Adaptive
Dynamic Sparse Attention (ADSA). Conceptually, ADSA dynamically identifies
historical tokens crucial for maintaining local texture consistency and those
essential for ensuring global semantic coherence, thereby efficiently
streamlining attention computation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic
KV-cache update mechanism tailored for ADSA, reducing GPU memory consumption
during inference by approximately $50\%$. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach in terms of both generation quality and resource efficiency.

*Yue Li,Meng Tian,Dechang Zhu,Jiangtong Zhu,Zhenyu Lin,Zhiwei Xiong,Xinhai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drive-R1 bridges reasoning and motion planning in autonomous driving by combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, outperforming existing VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of VLMs relying on shortcuts and misaligned reasoning in motion planning for autonomous driving.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning on COT data followed by reinforcement learning to align reasoning with planning outcomes.

Result: Drive-R1 achieves superior performance on nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks.

Conclusion: Drive-R1 offers a promising approach for integrating reasoning and planning in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) for autonomous driving (AD) are evolving
beyond perception and cognition tasks toward motion planning. However, we
identify two critical challenges in this direction: (1) VLMs tend to learn
shortcuts by relying heavily on history input information, achieving seemingly
strong planning results without genuinely understanding the visual inputs; and
(2) the chain-ofthought (COT) reasoning processes are always misaligned with
the motion planning outcomes, and how to effectively leverage the complex
reasoning capability to enhance planning remains largely underexplored. In this
paper, we start from a small-scale domain-specific VLM and propose Drive-R1
designed to bridges the scenario reasoning and motion planning for AD. Drive-R1
first undergoes the supervised finetuning on a elaborate dataset containing
both long and short COT data. Drive-R1 is encouraged to reason step-by-step
from visual input to final planning decisions. Subsequently, Drive-R1 is
trained within a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes the
discovery of reasoning paths that are more informative for planning, guided by
rewards based on predicted trajectories and meta actions. Experimental
evaluations on the nuScenes and DriveLM-nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that
Drive-R1 achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
VLMs. We believe that Drive-R1 presents a promising direction for bridging
reasoning and planning in AD, offering methodological insights for future
research and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new task, REIR, combining instance-level retrieval and localization, and proposes a benchmark (REIRCOCO) and baseline method (CLARE) with state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tasks (TIR and REC) lack precision or scalability for real-world scenarios requiring both retrieval and localization.

Method: Proposes CLARE, a dual-stream architecture with a MORE module and CLIA for end-to-end optimization, integrating object detection and REC pretraining.

Result: CLARE achieves state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC.

Conclusion: REIR addresses a critical gap, and CLARE demonstrates effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: Natural language querying of visual content underpins many vision-language
tasks, typically categorized by text granularity and visual search scope.
Text-Image Retrieval (TIR) retrieves whole images using coarse descriptions,
while Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) localizes objects using
fine-grained expressions within a single image. However, real-world scenarios
often require both instance-level retrieval and localization across large
galleries -- tasks where TIR lacks precision and REC lacks scalability. To
address this gap, we propose a new task: Referring Expression Instance
Retrieval (REIR), which jointly supports instance-level retrieval and
localization. We introduce REIRCOCO, a large-scale benchmark constructed by
prompting vision-language models to generate fine-grained expressions for
MSCOCO and RefCOCO instances. We also present a baseline method, CLARE,
featuring a dual-stream architecture with a Mix of Relation Experts (MORE)
module for capturing inter-instance relationships. CLARE integrates object
detection and REC pretraining with Contrastive Language-Instance Alignment
(CLIA) for end-to-end optimization. Experiments show that CLARE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on REIR and generalizes well to TIR and REC,
highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.

*Jongoh Jeong,Hunmin Yang,Jaeseok Jeong,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a semantic structure-aware attack framework using Mean Teacher to enhance adversarial transferability by leveraging under-exploited semantic features in generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative adversarial attacks lack full exploitation of semantic information in intermediate activations, limiting perturbation alignment with object-salient regions critical for transferability.

Method: Proposes a Mean Teacher-based framework for semantic consistency via feature distillation, anchoring perturbation synthesis to semantically salient early intermediate blocks.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in adversarial transferability across diverse models, domains, and tasks, validated by conventional metrics and a new Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances adversarial transferability by better utilizing semantic features, outperforming state-of-the-art generative attacks.

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

*Rui Su,Dong Xu,Luping Zhou,Wanli Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage approach for weakly supervised temporal action localization using multi-resolution temporal information and iterative pseudo-label refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of weakly supervised temporal action localization where only video-level annotations are available.

Method: Proposes an Initial Label Generation (ILG) module for reliable pseudo labels and a Progressive Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework with two networks (Network-OTS and Network-RTS) to refine labels iteratively.

Result: Improved temporal action localization performance by leveraging multi-resolution temporal information and exchanging refined pseudo labels between streams.

Conclusion: The approach effectively exploits temporal multi-resolution consistency and iterative refinement to enhance weakly supervised action localization.

Abstract: Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a challenging task as only
the video-level annotation is available during the training process. To address
this problem, we propose a two-stage approach to fully exploit multi-resolution
information in the temporal domain and generate high quality frame-level pseudo
labels based on both appearance and motion streams. Specifically, in the first
stage, we generate reliable initial frame-level pseudo labels, and in the
second stage, we iteratively refine the pseudo labels and use a set of selected
frames with highly confident pseudo labels to train neural networks and better
predict action class scores at each frame. We fully exploit temporal
information at multiple scales to improve temporal action localization
performance. Specifically, in order to obtain reliable initial frame-level
pseudo labels, in the first stage, we propose an Initial Label Generation (ILG)
module, which leverages temporal multi-resolution consistency to generate high
quality class activation sequences (CASs), which consist of a number of
sequences with each sequence measuring how likely each video frame belongs to
one specific action class. In the second stage, we propose a Progressive
Temporal Label Refinement (PTLR) framework. In our PTLR framework, two networks
called Network-OTS and Network-RTS, which are respectively used to generate
CASs for the original temporal scale and the reduced temporal scales, are used
as two streams (i.e., the OTS stream and the RTS stream) to refine the pseudo
labels in turn. By this way, the multi-resolution information in the temporal
domain is exchanged at the pseudo label level, and our work can help improve
each stream (i.e., the OTS/RTS stream) by exploiting the refined pseudo labels
from another stream (i.e., the RTS/OTS stream).

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-supervised method for 3D semantic occupancy prediction using only indoor Internet data, eliminating the need for precise geometric relationships or camera parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods require precise geometric data and fine-grained annotations, which are impractical due to data acquisition complexity and privacy concerns. The paper aims to overcome this by leveraging web data.

Method: The authors collect a dataset (YouTube-Occ) from YouTube house tours and develop a self-supervised model that distills 2D prior knowledge into 3D occupancy prediction using superpixels.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on NYUv2 and OccScanNet benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that accurate 3D semantic occupancy prediction can be achieved without precise geometric data, using only web-sourced indoor videos.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction in the past was considered to require
precise geometric relationships in order to enable effective training. However,
in complex indoor environments, the large-scale and widespread collection of
data, along with the necessity for fine-grained annotations, becomes
impractical due to the complexity of data acquisition setups and privacy
concerns. In this paper, we demonstrate that 3D spatially-accurate training can
be achieved using only indoor Internet data, without the need for any
pre-knowledge of intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters. In our framework, we
collect a web dataset, YouTube-Occ, which comprises house tour videos from
YouTube, providing abundant real house scenes for 3D representation learning.
Upon on this web dataset, we establish a fully self-supervised model to
leverage accessible 2D prior knowledge for reaching powerful 3D indoor
perception. Specifically, we harness the advantages of the prosperous vision
foundation models, distilling the 2D region-level knowledge into the occupancy
network by grouping the similar pixels into superpixels. Experimental results
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on two
popular benchmarks (NYUv2 and OccScanNet

TL;DR: ThermalLoc is a deep learning method for thermal image relocalization, outperforming existing methods by combining EfficientNet and Transformers for feature extraction and MLP networks for pose regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual relocalization methods are unsuitable for thermal images due to their different data capture mechanism. Thermal camera-based relocalization is underexplored despite deep learning advancements.

Method: ThermalLoc integrates EfficientNet with Transformers to extract local and global features from thermal images and uses two MLP networks for absolute pose regression.

Result: ThermalLoc outperforms AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet, and RobustLoc in accuracy and robustness on both public and proprietary datasets.

Conclusion: ThermalLoc addresses the gap in thermal image relocalization, offering superior performance and robustness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Thermal cameras capture environmental data through heat emission, a
fundamentally different mechanism compared to visible light cameras, which rely
on pinhole imaging. As a result, traditional visual relocalization methods
designed for visible light images are not directly applicable to thermal
images. Despite significant advancements in deep learning for camera
relocalization, approaches specifically tailored for thermal camera-based
relocalization remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
ThermalLoc, a novel end-to-end deep learning method for thermal image
relocalization. ThermalLoc effectively extracts both local and global features
from thermal images by integrating EfficientNet with Transformers, and performs
absolute pose regression using two MLP networks. We evaluated ThermalLoc on
both the publicly available thermal-odometry dataset and our own dataset. The
results demonstrate that ThermalLoc outperforms existing representative methods
employed for thermal camera relocalization, including AtLoc, MapNet, PoseNet,
and RobustLoc, achieving superior accuracy and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMDM, a diffusion model using adaptive masks for MRI reconstruction, improving quality by focusing on frequency-specific regions in k-space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous MRI reconstruction methods overlooked the importance of different frequency regions in k-space, limiting performance.

Method: AMDM adaptively adjusts masks based on k-space frequency distribution, enabling separation of high/low-frequency components and guiding a closed-loop diffusion process.

Result: Experiments showed improved MRI reconstruction quality by learning frequency-specific information.

Conclusion: AMDM provides a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data with adaptive masks, enhancing future MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: As the deep learning revolution marches on, masked modeling has emerged as a
distinctive approach that involves predicting parts of the original data that
are proportionally masked during training, and has demonstrated exceptional
performance in multiple fields. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction
is a critical task in medical imaging that seeks to recover high-quality images
from under-sampled k-space data. However, previous MRI reconstruction
strategies usually optimized the entire image domain or k-space, without
considering the importance of different frequency regions in the k-space This
work introduces a diffusion model based on adaptive masks (AMDM), which
utilizes the adaptive adjustment of frequency distribution based on k-space
data to develop a hybrid masks mechanism that adapts to different k-space
inputs. This enables the effective separation of high-frequency and
low-frequency components, producing diverse frequency-specific representations.
Additionally, the k-space frequency distribution informs the generation of
adaptive masks, which, in turn, guide a closed-loop diffusion process.
Experimental results verified the ability of this method to learn specific
frequency information and thereby improved the quality of MRI reconstruction,
providing a flexible framework for optimizing k-space data using masks in the
future.

TL;DR: A novel framework improves image explanation by reducing object hallucination and incompleteness, enhancing existing methods like Image Captioning, VQA, and Prompt-based AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image explanation methods often hallucinate objects or miss some, leading to inconsistency and incompleteness.

Method: Proposes an interpretable framework to rectify incorrect or missing objects in explanations, applicable to Image Captioning, VQA, and Prompt-based AI.

Result: Quantitative improvements: Image Captioning (81.81% completeness, 37.10% inconsistency), VQA (9.6% completeness, 37.10% inconsistency), Prompt-based AI (0.01% completeness, 5.2% inconsistency).

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances explanation quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Image explanation has been one of the key research interests in the Deep
Learning field. Throughout the years, several approaches have been adopted to
explain an input image fed by the user. From detecting an object in a given
image to explaining it in human understandable sentence, to having a
conversation describing the image, this problem has seen an immense change
throughout the years, However, the existing works have been often found to (a)
hallucinate objects that do not exist in the image and/or (b) lack identifying
the complete set of objects present in the image. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to mitigate these drawbacks of inconsistency and incompleteness
of the objects recognized during the image explanation. To enable this, we
propose an interpretable framework that can be plugged atop diverse image
explaining frameworks including Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering

capabilities by rectifying the incorrect or missing objects. We further measure
the efficacy of the rectified explanations generated through our proposed

Quantitatively, the proposed framework is able to improve the explanations over
the baseline architectures of Image Captioning (improving the completeness by
81.81% and inconsistency by 37.10%), Visual Question Answering(average of 9.6%
and 37.10% in completeness and inconsistency respectively) and Prompt-based AI
model (0.01% and 5.2% for completeness and inconsistency respectively)
surpassing the current state-of-the-art by a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional closed-set classification fails in open-world clinical scenarios where unseen conditions arise, compromising AI reliability.

Method: Evaluates OSR capabilities of ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid ResNet-Transformer model using OpenMax as a baseline on the Kvasir dataset.

Result: Provides foundational benchmarks for OSR in medical image analysis, showing model behavior in realistic clinical settings.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of OSR techniques for safe AI deployment in endoscopy, offering practical insights.

Abstract: Endoscopic image classification plays a pivotal role in medical diagnostics
by identifying anatomical landmarks and pathological findings. However,
conventional closed-set classification frameworks are inherently limited in
open-world clinical settings, where previously unseen conditions can arise
andcompromise model reliability. To address this, we explore the application of
Open Set Recognition (OSR) techniques on the Kvasir dataset, a publicly
available and diverse endoscopic image collection. In this study, we evaluate
and compare the OSR capabilities of several representative deep learning
architectures, including ResNet-50, Swin Transformer, and a hybrid
ResNet-Transformer model, under both closed-set and open-set conditions.
OpenMax is adopted as a baseline OSR method to assess the ability of these
models to distinguish known classes from previously unseen categories. This
work represents one of the first efforts to apply open set recognition to the
Kvasir dataset and provides a foundational benchmark for evaluating OSR
performance in medical image analysis. Our results offer practical insights
into model behavior in clinically realistic settings and highlight the
importance of OSR techniques for the safe deployment of AI systems in
endoscopy.

TL;DR: Proposes an architecture with an Importance Estimator to select key neighboring people for predicting a person's trajectory, using Gumbel Softmax for training, achieving faster processing with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve trajectory prediction by effectively selecting important neighboring people.

Method: Uses an Importance Estimator module and Gumbel Softmax for differentiable sampling of neighboring people.

Result: Speeds up the process while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy on the JRDB dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently selects relevant neighbors for trajectory prediction without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents an architecture for selecting important neighboring
people to predict the primary person's trajectory. To achieve effective
neighboring people selection, we propose a people selection module called the
Importance Estimator which outputs the importance of each neighboring person
for predicting the primary person's future trajectory. To prevent gradients
from being blocked by non-differentiable operations when sampling surrounding
people based on their importance, we employ the Gumbel Softmax for training.
Experiments conducted on the JRDB dataset show that our method speeds up the
process with competitive prediction accuracy.

### [103] [Rapeseed population point cloud completion network (RP-PCN) with dynamic graph convolution for 3D reconstruction of crop canopy occlusion architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18292)
*Ziyue Guo,Xin Yang,Yutao Shen,Yang Zhu,Lixi Jiang,Haiyan Cen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A point cloud completion model (RP-PCN) is proposed for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations, improving canopy architecture analysis and yield prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate canopy architecture descriptions are hindered by occlusion and complexity, limiting crop photosynthesis and yield evaluation.

Method: Uses multi-view imaging, VRI simulation, occlusion detection, and RP-PCN with MRDG and PPD modules for point cloud completion.

Result: RP-PCN achieved low CD values (3.35-4.51 cm) across growth stages and improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%.

Conclusion: RP-PCN effectively reconstructs canopy architectures, with potential applications in other crops for enhanced field analysis.

Abstract: Quantitative descriptions of complete canopy architecture are crucial for
evaluating crop photosynthesis and yield to guide ideotype design. Although
three-dimensional (3D) sensing technologies have been developed for plant and
canopy reconstruction, severe occlusion and complex architectures hinder
accurate canopy descriptions. In this study, we propose a point cloud
completion model for 3D reconstruction of rapeseed populations from seeding to
silique stages using multi-view imaging. A complete point cloud generation
framework was developed with the virtual-real integration (VRI) simulation
method and occlusion point detection algorithm to annotate the training dataset
by distinguishing surface from occluded points. The rapeseed population point
cloud completion network (RP-PCN) was designed with a multi-resolution dynamic
graph convolutional encoder (MRDG) and point pyramid decoder (PPD) to predict
occluded points based on input surface point clouds. A dynamic graph
convolutional feature extractor (DGCFE) was introduced to capture structural
variations across the growth period. The effectiveness of point cloud
completion was validated by predicting yield using architectural indicators
from complete point clouds of rapeseed population. The results demonstrated
that RP-PCN achieved chamfer distance (CD) values of 3.35 cm, 3.46 cm, 4.32 cm,
and 4.51 cm at the seedling, bolting, flowering, and silique stages,
respectively. Ablation studies showed the effectiveness of the MRDG and DGCFE
modules, reducing CD values by 10% and 23%, respectively. The silique
efficiency index (SEI) from RP-PCN improved yield prediction accuracy by 11.2%
compared to incomplete point clouds. The RP-PCN pipeline proposed in this study
has the potential to be extended to other crops, significantly enhancing the
analysis of population canopy architectures in field environments.

TL;DR: The study uses remote sensing and advanced modeling to classify crops in Central Punjab, combining field surveys, satellite imagery, and machine learning for accurate results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve crop classification accuracy in irrigated regions using remote sensing and advanced modeling techniques.

Method: Field surveys for geocoding crops, Landsat 8-9 imagery pre-processing, image fusion, vegetation indices extraction, and classification using conventional classifiers, ensemble learning, and neural networks.

Result: A comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data points was created, enabling accurate crop classification with enhanced spectral information.

Conclusion: Combining remote sensing data and advanced modeling significantly improves crop classification accuracy in irrigated agricultural areas.

Abstract: Remote sensing offers a highly effective method for obtaining accurate
information on total cropped area and crop types. The study focuses on crop
cover identification for irrigated regions of Central Punjab. Data collection
was executed in two stages: the first involved identifying and geocoding six
target crops through field surveys conducted in January and February 2023. The
second stage involved acquiring Landsat 8-9 imagery for each geocoded field to
construct a labelled dataset. The satellite imagery underwent extensive
pre-processing, including radiometric calibration for reflectance values,
atmospheric correction, and georeferencing verification to ensure consistency
within a common coordinate system. Subsequently, image fusion techniques were
applied to combine Landsat 8 and 9 spectral bands, creating a composite image
with enhanced spectral information, followed by contrast enhancement. During
data acquisition, farmers were interviewed, and fields were meticulously mapped
using GPS instruments, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 50,835 data
points. This dataset facilitated the extraction of vegetation indices such as
NDVI, SAVO, RECI, and NDRE. These indices and raw reflectance values were
utilized for classification modeling using conventional classifiers, ensemble
learning, and artificial neural networks. A feature selection approach was also
incorporated to identify the optimal feature set for classification learning.
This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining remote sensing data and
advanced modeling techniques to improve crop classification accuracy in
irrigated agricultural regions.

*Yiwei Yang,Chung Peng Lee,Shangbin Feng,Dora Zhao,Bingbing Wen,Anthony Z. Liu,Yulia Tsvetkov,Bill Howe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpuriVerse, a benchmark for studying spurious correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), sourced from real-world VQA errors and synthetic counterfactuals. It evaluates 15 LVLMs, showing poor performance (37.1% accuracy) and improvement (78.4%) after fine-tuning on synthetic examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of benchmarks for studying spurious correlations in LVLMs trained on diverse, unsupervised datasets, moving beyond contrived settings.

Method: Developed SpuriVerse by curating GPT-4o errors on VQA benchmarks, using LVLM-human annotation and synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify spurious correlations.

Result: State-of-the-art LVLMs performed poorly (37.1% accuracy) on SpuriVerse, but fine-tuning on synthetic examples improved accuracy to 78.4%.

Conclusion: Training on diverse spurious patterns helps models generalize and avoid shortcuts, improving performance on unseen situations.

Abstract: Finetuning can cause spurious correlations to arise between non-essential
features and the target labels, but benchmarks to study these effects involve
contrived settings and narrow tasks. In contrast, we consider spurious
correlations in multi-modal Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) pretrained on
extensive and diverse datasets without explicit task supervision. We develop a
benchmark by sourcing GPT-4o errors on real-world visual-question-answering
(VQA) benchmarks, then curating a subset through LVLM-human annotation and
synthetic counterfactual evaluation to identify errors caused by spurious
correlations. This process yields SpuriVerse, a novel benchmark comprised of
124 distinct types of spurious correlations extracted from real-world datasets,
each containing 1 realistic and 10 synthetic VQA samples for a total of 1364
multiple choice questions. We evaluate 15 open and closed-source LVLMs on
SpuriVerse, finding that even state-of-the-art closed-source models struggle
significantly, achieving at best only 37.1% accuracy. Fine-tuning on synthetic
examples that emphasize the spurious correlation improves performance to
78.40%, suggesting that training on diverse spurious patterns generalizes to
unseen situations: models appear to learn to avoid "shortcuts" and attend to
the overall image context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of low-light image enhancement without paired training data, overcoming limitations of traditional and deep learning methods.

Method: Integrates multi-scale spatial attention with deep curve estimation, uses recurrent enhancement and a composite loss function with six components, including a no-reference quality loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, achieving high visual quality, structural consistency, and efficiency.

Conclusion: LucentVisionNet is effective for real-world applications like mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement remains a challenging task, particularly in the
absence of paired training data. In this study, we present LucentVisionNet, a
novel zero-shot learning framework that addresses the limitations of
traditional and deep learning-based enhancement methods. The proposed approach
integrates multi-scale spatial attention with a deep curve estimation network,
enabling fine-grained enhancement while preserving semantic and perceptual
fidelity. To further improve generalization, we adopt a recurrent enhancement
strategy and optimize the model using a composite loss function comprising six
tailored components, including a novel no-reference image quality loss inspired
by human visual perception. Extensive experiments on both paired and unpaired
benchmark datasets demonstrate that LucentVisionNet consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot methods across
multiple full-reference and no-reference image quality metrics. Our framework
achieves high visual quality, structural consistency, and computational
efficiency, making it well-suited for deployment in real-world applications
such as mobile photography, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address risks of misuse in T2I models (e.g., harmful content generation) while maintaining ethical goals and usability.

Method: Proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan) with two variants: PromptSan-Modify (iterative token replacement) and PromptSan-Suffix (optimized suffix training).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing harmful content, balancing safety and usability.

Conclusion: PromptSan effectively mitigates harmful content generation in T2I models without compromising functionality.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, such as Stable
Diffusion, has enhanced their capability to synthesize images from textual
prompts. However, this progress also raises significant risks of misuse,
including the generation of harmful content (e.g., pornography, violence,
discrimination), which contradicts the ethical goals of T2I technology and
hinders its sustainable development. Inspired by "jailbreak" attacks in large
language models, which bypass restrictions through subtle prompt modifications,
this paper proposes NSFW-Classifier Guided Prompt Sanitization (PromptSan), a
novel approach to detoxify harmful prompts without altering model architecture
or degrading generation capability. PromptSan includes two variants:
PromptSan-Modify, which iteratively identifies and replaces harmful tokens in
input prompts using text NSFW classifiers during inference, and
PromptSan-Suffix, which trains an optimized suffix token sequence to neutralize
harmful intent while passing both text and image NSFW classifier checks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PromptSan achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reducing harmful content generation across multiple metrics,
effectively balancing safety and usability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for 3D generative models integrates human preferences via differentiable reward functions, enhancing geometry-aware content creation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models lack alignment with human preferences and 3D structure understanding, relying on 2D methods.

Method: Proposes an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework with geometry-aware reward functions.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness using four novel reward functions for controllable, interpretable 3D content generation.

Conclusion: The framework improves quality and alignment of 3D content with human preferences and task-specific needs.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generative models have achieved impressive results but
3D contents generated by these models may not align with subjective human
preferences or task-specific criteria. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D
texture generation domain remains: most existing approaches rely on repeated
calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent
understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To address this,
we propose an end-to-end differentiable preference learning framework that
back-propagates human preferences, represented by differentiable reward
functions, through the entire 3D generative pipeline, making the process
inherently geometry-aware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
using four proposed novel geometry-aware reward functions, offering a more
controllable and interpretable pathway for high-quality 3D content creation
from natural language.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel architecture for medical image segmentation that improves accuracy by capturing multi-scale features and enhancing decoder efficiency, outperforming SOTA methods on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of Transformer and CNN methods in handling staining/morphology variations and inefficient feature transfer from encoders to decoders in medical image segmentation.

Method: Introduces an architecture for multi-scale local and global contextual information capture and a novel decoder design to integrate encoder features, emphasize key channels/regions, and reconstruct spatial dimensions.

Result: Achieves absolute performance gains of 2.76% (MoNuSeg), 3.12% (DSB), 2.87% (Electron Microscopy), and 4.03% (TNBC) over SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly enhances segmentation accuracy and is compatible with various encoders, validated by experiments and ablation studies.

Abstract: Segmenting biomarkers in medical images is crucial for various biotech
applications. Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often
struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature
extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited
sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher
accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to
underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich
multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in
decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that
captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel
decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder,
emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions
to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders,
outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and
ablation studies. Specifically, our method achieves absolute performance gains
of 2.76% on MoNuSeg, 3.12% on DSB, 2.87% on Electron Microscopy, and 4.03% on
TNBC datasets compared to existing SOTA methods. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BSMamba, a new visual Mamba architecture, enhances low-light images by prioritizing brightness and semantic token interactions, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods struggle with brightness improvement, semantic consistency, and computational efficiency. Current visual Mamba models flatten images into 1D tokens, limiting long-range dependencies.

Method: BSMamba introduces Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. Brightness Mamba connects distant tokens with similar brightness, while Semantic Mamba links tokens with shared semantics, preserving context.

Result: BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE, balancing brightness restoration and semantic consistency.

Conclusion: BSMamba overcomes limitations of traditional token sequencing, offering a superior solution for low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant
limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic
consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of
state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved
remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images
into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting
interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining
their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these
fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture
comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic
Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by
prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels,
effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks
through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic
Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic
meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting
semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical
nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens
based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning
patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing
while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while
preserving semantic consistency.

TL;DR: A novel SFIFNet method integrates frequency and spatial domain information to improve Few-shot learning performance by enhancing feature representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-shot learning faces challenges like overfitting and poor generalization due to limited data. Existing models often ignore frequency domain information, which holds valuable features.

Method: Proposes SFIFNet with innovative data preprocessing to combine frequency and spatial domain information for better feature representation.

Result: Experiments show improved classification performance by leveraging both domains.

Conclusion: Integrating frequency domain information with spatial data enhances Few-shot learning accuracy and performance.

Abstract: The objective of Few-shot learning is to fully leverage the limited data
resources for exploring the latent correlations within the data by applying
algorithms and training a model with outstanding performance that can
adequately meet the demands of practical applications. In practical
applications, the number of images in each category is usually less than that
in traditional deep learning, which can lead to over-fitting and poor
generalization performance. Currently, many Few-shot classification models pay
more attention to spatial domain information while neglecting frequency domain
information, which contains more feature information. Ignoring frequency domain
information will prevent the model from fully exploiting feature information,
which would effect the classification performance. Based on conventional data
augmentation, this paper proposes an SFIFNet with innovative data
preprocessing. The key of this method is enhancing the accuracy of image
feature representation by integrating frequency domain information with spatial
domain information. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this method in enhancing classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeeKer detects anomalous human poses in skeleton sequences using autoregressive factorization and conditional Gaussians, outperforming prior methods on key datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalous human behavior detection is crucial for safety-critical applications like healthcare and surveillance, where unusual poses often indicate abnormalities.

Method: SeeKer uses autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level, modeling skeleton sequences with conditional Gaussians. Anomalies are flagged based on low-density keypoint locations.

Result: SeeKer outperforms previous methods on UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets and achieves competitive performance on ShanghaiTech.

Conclusion: SeeKer's simplicity and effectiveness make it a strong solution for detecting anomalous human poses in skeleton sequences.

Abstract: Detecting anomalous human behaviour is an important visual task in
safety-critical applications such as healthcare monitoring, workplace safety,
or public surveillance. In these contexts, abnormalities are often reflected
with unusual human poses. Thus, we propose SeeKer, a method for detecting
anomalies in sequences of human skeletons. Our method formulates the skeleton
sequence density through autoregressive factorization at the keypoint level.
The corresponding conditional distributions represent probable keypoint
locations given prior skeletal motion. We formulate the joint distribution of
the considered skeleton as causal prediction of conditional Gaussians across
its constituent keypoints. A skeleton is flagged as anomalous if its keypoint
locations surprise our model (i.e. receive a low density). In practice, our
anomaly score is a weighted sum of per-keypoint log-conditionals, where the
weights account for the confidence of the underlying keypoint detector. Despite
its conceptual simplicity, SeeKer surpasses all previous methods on the
UBnormal and MSAD-HR datasets while delivering competitive performance on the
ShanghaiTech dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with personalized image captions, even after SFT, due to limited high-quality caption data for complex scenarios.

Method: Introduces a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework for MLLMs.

Result: Enhances visual recognition and personalized generation, outperforming SFT-based methods in multi-concept captioning.

Conclusion: RL-based post-training effectively addresses limitations of SFT, improving MLLM performance in personalized captioning.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate
personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In
this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing
post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being
post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world
scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring
large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and
difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for
personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual
recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently
outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging
multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: Recent benchmarks and datasets have been proposed to improve spatial

limited in scale, visual diversity, and instruction expressiveness. In this
work, we introduce InternSpatial, the largest open-source dataset for spatial
reasoning in VLMs, along with InternSpatial-Bench, a corresponding evaluation
benchmark designed to assess spatial understanding under diverse instruction
formats. InternSpatial comprises 12 million QA pairs spanning both single-view

19 instruction formats that reflect varied query styles. For evaluation, we
propose InternSpatial-Bench for single-view tasks and expand multi-view
reasoning by introducing a novel rotation angle prediction task that has not
been explored in prior work. Experimental results show that models trained on
InternSpatial achieve 12.1% improvement on InternSpatial-Bench and 10.7% on

Method: The method approximates the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, uses GCI fusion as the normalised product of these, and projects the resulting PMBM back to PMB for future steps.

Result: The approach yields a closed-form PMBM expression, with experimental results showing superior performance over other distributed multi-object filters.

Conclusion: The proposed distributed PMB filter with GCI fusion offers a tractable and effective solution for multi-object tracking, validated by experimental results.

Abstract: This paper presents the distributed Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter
based on the generalised covariance intersection (GCI) fusion rule for
distributed multi-object filtering. Since the exact GCI fusion of two PMB
densities is intractable, we derive a principled approximation. Specifically,
we approximate the power of a PMB density as an unnormalised PMB density, which
corresponds to an upper bound of the PMB density. Then, the GCI fusion rule
corresponds to the normalised product of two unnormalised PMB densities. We
show that the result is a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM), which can be
expressed in closed form. Future prediction and update steps in each filter
preserve the PMBM form, which can be projected back to a PMB density before the
next fusion step. Experimental results show the benefits of this approach
compared to other distributed multi-object filters.

*Ciro Listone,Aniello Murano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder and SVM for interpretable melanoma risk assessment, improving clinical insight and trust in AI diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of interpretability in existing deep learning models for melanoma diagnosis, which often provide only binary outputs with limited clinical utility.

Method: Uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to learn a structured latent space capturing semantic lesion relationships, combined with an SVM for classification.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance in differentiating benign nevi from melanomas, with the latent space enabling visual and geometric risk interpretation.

Conclusion: The approach enhances early detection, identifies ambiguous cases, and improves trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through interpretable risk modeling.

Abstract: Melanoma represents a critical health risk due to its aggressive progression
and high mortality, underscoring the need for early, interpretable diagnostic
tools. While deep learning has advanced in skin lesion classification, most
existing models provide only binary outputs, offering limited clinical insight.
This work introduces a novel approach that extends beyond classification,
enabling interpretable risk modelling through a Conditional Variational
Autoencoder. The proposed method learns a structured latent space that captures
semantic relationships among lesions, allowing for a nuanced, continuous
assessment of morphological differences. An SVM is also trained on this
representation effectively differentiating between benign nevi and melanomas,
demonstrating strong and consistent performance. More importantly, the learned
latent space supports visual and geometric interpretation of malignancy, with
the spatial proximity of a lesion to known melanomas serving as a meaningful
indicator of risk. This approach bridges predictive performance with clinical
applicability, fostering early detection, highlighting ambiguous cases, and
enhancing trust in AI-assisted diagnosis through transparent and interpretable
decision-making.

TL;DR: A structured benchmark evaluates transferability of CNNs and Foundation Models for COVID-19 prognosis prediction using diverse Chest X-ray datasets, comparing fine-tuning strategies under varied data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI's potential in medical imaging prognosis is hindered by challenges in effective application, prompting the need for a benchmark to assess model transferability and adaptability.

Method: The study employs diverse fine-tuning strategies (Full Fine-Tuning, Linear Probing, Parameter-Efficient methods) on pretrained models (general-purpose and biomedical-specific) across full-data and Few-Shot Learning scenarios.

Result: Rigorous comparative analysis reveals model adaptability and generalization under data scarcity and class imbalance, highlighting strengths and limitations of each strategy.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides insights for deploying robust, efficient AI solutions in clinical prognosis, addressing real-world challenges like data scarcity and class imbalance.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for improving
prognosis prediction in medical imaging, yet its effective application remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a structured benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate and compare the transferability of Convolutional Neural
Networks and Foundation Models in predicting clinical outcomes in COVID-19
patients, leveraging diverse publicly available Chest X-ray datasets. Our
experimental methodology extensively explores a wide set of fine-tuning
strategies, encompassing traditional approaches such as Full Fine-Tuning and
Linear Probing, as well as advanced Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning methods
including Low-Rank Adaptation, BitFit, VeRA, and IA3. The evaluations were
conducted across multiple learning paradigms, including both extensive
full-data scenarios and more clinically realistic Few-Shot Learning settings,
which are critical for modeling rare disease outcomes and rapidly emerging
health threats. By implementing a large-scale comparative analysis involving a
diverse selection of pretrained models, including general-purpose architectures
pretrained on large-scale datasets such as CLIP and DINOv2, to
biomedical-specific models like MedCLIP, BioMedCLIP, and PubMedCLIP, we
rigorously assess each model's capacity to effectively adapt and generalize to
prognosis tasks, particularly under conditions of severe data scarcity and
pronounced class imbalance. The benchmark was designed to capture critical
conditions common in prognosis tasks, including variations in dataset size and
class distribution, providing detailed insights into the strengths and
limitations of each fine-tuning strategy. This extensive and structured
evaluation aims to inform the practical deployment and adoption of robust,
efficient, and generalizable AI-driven solutions in real-world clinical
prognosis prediction workflows.

*Sijin He,Guangfeng Lin,Tao Li,Yajun Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Transformer-based image inpainting method with frequency-domain fusion improves detail preservation and reduces computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with complex textures and large occlusions, while Transformer-based approaches often lose high-frequency details and are computationally expensive.

Method: Combines wavelet transform and Gabor filtering in an attention mechanism for multi-scale structural modeling. Uses a learnable frequency-domain filter based on FFT for adaptive noise suppression and detail retention. Adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure with a novel loss strategy.

Result: The method effectively preserves high-frequency information, improving inpainting quality.

Conclusion: The proposed approach balances global semantics and fine details, outperforming traditional and Transformer-based methods.

Abstract: Image inpainting plays a vital role in restoring missing image regions and
supporting high-level vision tasks, but traditional methods struggle with
complex textures and large occlusions. Although Transformer-based approaches
have demonstrated strong global modeling capabilities, they often fail to
preserve high-frequency details due to the low-pass nature of self-attention
and suffer from high computational costs. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a Transformer-based image inpainting method incorporating
frequency-domain fusion. Specifically, an attention mechanism combining wavelet
transform and Gabor filtering is introduced to enhance multi-scale structural
modeling and detail preservation. Additionally, a learnable frequency-domain
filter based on the fast Fourier transform is designed to replace the
feedforward network, enabling adaptive noise suppression and detail retention.
The model adopts a four-level encoder-decoder structure and is guided by a
novel loss strategy to balance global semantics and fine details. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves the quality
of image inpainting by preserving more high-frequency information.

*Dinh-Khoi Vo,Thanh-Toan Do,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran,Trung-Nghia Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPAM is a zero-shot framework for editing real images using text, preserving object and background details without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with preserving textures, identity, and background details in complex, non-rigid image editing.

Method: CPAM uses a preservation adaptation module for self-attention control and a localized extraction module to manage cross-attention interference, with mask-guidance strategies.

Result: CPAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the IMBA benchmark, preferred by human raters.

Conclusion: CPAM offers an effective, zero-shot solution for complex real image editing, preserving context and details.

Abstract: Editing natural images using textual descriptions in text-to-image diffusion
models remains a significant challenge, particularly in achieving consistent
generation and handling complex, non-rigid objects. Existing methods often
struggle to preserve textures and identity, require extensive fine-tuning, and
exhibit limitations in editing specific spatial regions or objects while
retaining background details. This paper proposes Context-Preserving Adaptive
Manipulation (CPAM), a novel zero-shot framework for complicated, non-rigid
real image editing. Specifically, we propose a preservation adaptation module
that adjusts self-attention mechanisms to preserve and independently control
the object and background effectively. This ensures that the objects' shapes,
textures, and identities are maintained while keeping the background
undistorted during the editing process using the mask guidance technique.
Additionally, we develop a localized extraction module to mitigate the
interference with the non-desired modified regions during conditioning in
cross-attention mechanisms. We also introduce various mask-guidance strategies
to facilitate diverse image manipulation tasks in a simple manner. Extensive
experiments on our newly constructed Image Manipulation BenchmArk (IMBA), a
robust benchmark dataset specifically designed for real image editing,
demonstrate that our proposed method is the preferred choice among human
raters, outperforming existing state-of-the-art editing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIP is an unsupervised post-training method for enhancing dense image representations in pretrained vision encoders, using pseudo-tasks for in-context scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve dense representations in vision encoders without complex architectures or labeled data.

Method: Trains the encoder using pseudo-tasks generated by combining a pretrained diffusion model and the encoder itself, simulating downstream scenarios.

Result: Achieves strong performance on downstream tasks, outperforming initial encoders and prior methods.

Conclusion: DIP is a simple, efficient, and effective solution for enhancing dense representations in vision encoders.

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to
enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders
for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on
complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder
using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios,
inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled
data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that
combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is
simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9
hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo
in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of
downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both
the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and
effective solution for improving dense representations. Code available here:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AViLA, a video-language agent for handling asynchronous queries and evidence in streaming data, improving accuracy and temporal awareness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user queries and supporting evidence arrive at different times in dynamic data streams, requiring temporal awareness and reasoning.

Method: Proposes AViLA with three modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and evidence-grounded trigger, to manage streaming data and ad-hoc queries.

Result: AViLA outperforms existing models in accuracy and temporal awareness, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling asynchronous interactions.

Conclusion: AViLA provides a robust solution for real-world applications like autonomous driving and embodied agents, enhancing interaction with streaming data.

Abstract: An ideal vision-language agent serves as a bridge between the human users and
their surrounding physical world in real-world applications like autonomous
driving and embodied agents, and proactively provides accurate and timely
responses given user intents. An intriguing challenge arises when agents
interact with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:
supporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears
asynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground
their responses in historical data, present observations, and even future
streams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user
queries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the
streaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities
but also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with
temporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that
evaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle
interaction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous
Video-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc
queries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of
three key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and
evidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose
memory and respond readily and timely to queries. Our experiments show that
existing models often fail to respond at appropriate times, while AViLA
significantly improves both accuracy and temporal awareness. Our code and
dataset will be publicly available.

*Yaokun Zhong,Siyu Jiang,Jian Zhu,Jian-Fang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Context Consistency Learning (CCL) for Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG), improving localization of sentences in videos with limited annotations by combining consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect perturbing query contexts for strong supervisory signals, limiting performance in SSVPG.

Method: Proposes CCL, a framework unifying teacher-student consistency learning and pseudo-labeling, using strong augmentation and mutual agreement for confidence.

Result: CCL significantly outperforms existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: CCL effectively enhances semi-supervised learning for video paragraph grounding by leveraging context consistency and pseudo-labels.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Video Paragraph Grounding (SSVPG) aims to localize multiple
sentences in a paragraph from an untrimmed video with limited temporal
annotations. Existing methods focus on teacher-student consistency learning and
video-level contrastive loss, but they overlook the importance of perturbing
query contexts to generate strong supervisory signals. In this work, we propose
a novel Context Consistency Learning (CCL) framework that unifies the paradigms
of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to enhance semi-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first conduct teacher-student learning where the
student model takes as inputs strongly-augmented samples with sentences removed
and is enforced to learn from the adequately strong supervisory signals from
the teacher model. Afterward, we conduct model retraining based on the
generated pseudo labels, where the mutual agreement between the original and
augmented views' predictions is utilized as the label confidence. Extensive
experiments show that CCL outperforms existing methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HER2match, the first public dataset for H&E-HER2 staining transfer, compares GANs and Diffusion Models, and highlights the superiority of GANs and the importance of data alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of public datasets and unclear best model frameworks for H&E-HER2 staining transfer motivated the creation of HER2match and a comparative study of generative models.

Method: The authors introduce HER2match dataset and compare GANs and Diffusion Models, including a novel Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model, for H&E-HER2 translation.

Result: GANs outperform DMs, with BBDM being the only DM achieving comparable results. Data alignment significantly improves model performance.

Conclusion: The study provides a high-quality dataset and framework comparison, guiding future research in virtual staining for H&E-HER2 transfer.

Abstract: Virtual staining is a promising technique that uses deep generative models to
recreate histological stains, providing a faster and more cost-effective
alternative to traditional tissue chemical staining. Specifically for H&E-HER2
staining transfer, despite a rising trend in publications, the lack of
sufficient public datasets has hindered progress in the topic. Additionally, it
is currently unclear which model frameworks perform best for this particular
task. In this paper, we introduce the HER2match dataset, the first publicly
available dataset with the same breast cancer tissue sections stained with both
H&E and HER2. Furthermore, we compare the performance of several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), and implement a novel
Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model for H&E-HER2 translation. Our findings indicate
that, overall, GANs perform better than DMs, with only the BBDM achieving
comparable results. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of data alignment,
as all models trained on HER2match produced vastly improved visuals compared to
the widely used consecutive-slide BCI dataset. This research provides a new
high-quality dataset ([available upon publication acceptance]), improving both
model training and evaluation. In addition, our comparison of frameworks offers
valuable guidance for researchers working on the topic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShowFlow is a framework for customizable image generation, addressing challenges in single- and multi-concept scenarios with specialized modules and no extra conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in identity preservation and prompt alignment in single- and multi-concept image generation.

Method: ShowFlow-S uses a KronA-WED adapter and disentangled learning; ShowFlow-M reuses ShowFlow-S models with SAMA and layout consistency.

Result: Effective in experiments and user studies, suitable for real-world applications like advertising.

Conclusion: ShowFlow offers a robust solution for controllable image synthesis, balancing identity and alignment.

Abstract: Customizing image generation remains a core challenge in controllable image
synthesis. For single-concept generation, maintaining both identity
preservation and prompt alignment is challenging. In multi-concept scenarios,
relying solely on a prompt without additional conditions like layout boxes or
semantic masks, often leads to identity loss and concept omission. In this
paper, we introduce ShowFlow, a comprehensive framework designed to tackle
these challenges. We propose ShowFlow-S for single-concept image generation,
and ShowFlow-M for handling multiple concepts. ShowFlow-S introduces a
KronA-WED adapter, which integrates a Kronecker adapter with weight and
embedding decomposition, and employs a disentangled learning approach with a
novel attention regularization objective to enhance single-concept generation.
Building on this foundation, ShowFlow-M directly reuses the learned models from
ShowFlow-S to support multi-concept generation without extra conditions,
incorporating a Subject-Adaptive Matching Attention (SAMA) and a layout
consistency strategy as the plug-and-play module. Extensive experiments and
user studies validate ShowFlow's effectiveness, highlighting its potential in
real-world applications like advertising and virtual dressing.

### [126] [Biased Teacher, Balanced Student](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18496)
*Seonghak Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LTKD improves knowledge distillation for imbalanced data by addressing teacher bias with rebalanced inter-group and uniform intra-group losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional KD fails in long-tailed data due to teacher bias toward head classes, limiting supervision for tail classes.

Method: Reformulates KD into inter-group and intra-group KL divergence, introduces rebalanced inter-group loss and uniform intra-group loss.

Result: Outperforms existing KD methods on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and ImageNet-LT, improving overall and tail-class accuracy.

Conclusion: LTKD effectively transfers knowledge from biased teachers, making it suitable for resource-constrained, imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a widely adopted model compression technique
where a compact student model learns from the output of a larger, pre-trained
teacher. While effective in balanced settings, conventional KD suffers
significantly when applied to long-tailed data distributions, as the teacher
model tends to be biased toward head classes and provides limited supervision
for tail classes. In this paper, we propose Long-Tailed Knowledge Distillation
(LTKD), a novel framework tailored for class-imbalanced scenarios. We begin by
reformulating the standard KD objective into two components: inter-group and
intra-group Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, corresponding to the prediction
distributions across and within class groups (head, medium, tail),
respectively. This decomposition allows us to identify and quantify the sources
of teacher bias. To address them, we introduce (1) a rebalanced inter-group
loss that calibrates the teacher's group-level predictions and (2) a uniform
intra-group loss that ensures equal contribution from all groups during
distillation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100-LT, TinyImageNet-LT, and
ImageNet-LT show that LTKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods,
achieving significant gains in both overall accuracy and tail-class
performance. Our results demonstrate that LTKD enables effective knowledge
transfer even from biased teachers, making it a strong candidate for real-world
deployment in resource-constrained and imbalanced settings.

Result: Summarizes benchmarks and performance comparisons, highlighting advancements and gaps in VLM generalization.

Conclusion: Provides a clear overview of current VLM research and future directions, bridging VLMs and MLLMs.

Abstract: Recently, vision-language pretraining has emerged as a transformative
technique that integrates the strengths of both visual and textual modalities,
resulting in powerful vision-language models (VLMs). Leveraging web-scale
pretraining data, these models exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities. However,
their performance often deteriorates when confronted with domain-specific or
specialized generalization tasks. To address this, a growing body of research
focuses on transferring or generalizing the rich knowledge embedded in VLMs to
various downstream applications. This survey aims to comprehensively summarize
the generalization settings, methodologies, benchmarking and results in VLM
literatures. Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are
categorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods
according to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in
each category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical
transfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the
era of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced
with thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the
advances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses
the relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large
language models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the
surging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical
generalization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify visual understanding and generation in a shared space without modality-specific designs, leveraging text-aligned representations for cross-modal tasks.

Method: Uses TA-Tok for image-to-token conversion, scale-adaptive encoding/decoding, and two de-tokenizers (autoregressive and diffusion-based) for diverse outputs. Advanced pre-training tasks enhance modality fusion.

Result: Tar matches or surpasses existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater training efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully integrates vision and text, enabling efficient cross-modal tasks and high-fidelity visual outputs, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual
understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation.
At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into
discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language
model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space
with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input
and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific
designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to
balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to
produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we
utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a
diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced
pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and
generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses
existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater
training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable multi-disease diagnosis remains a critical
challenge in medical research, particularly when leveraging heterogeneous
multimodal medical data. Current approaches often rely on single-modal data,
limiting their ability to comprehensively understand complex diseases. To
address this, we propose MedTVT-R1, a novel Multimodal Large Language Model

dataset that provides question-answer pairs for physiological-level
interpretations and disease-level diagnoses with a Chain of Evidence approach.
MedTVT-R1 incorporates a modality perception layer to capture inter-modal
dependencies and adaptively weight modality contributions. Additionally, we
employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based Reinforcement
Fine-Tuning with a Jaccard Reward function to enhance diagnostic reasoning.
Experimental results demonstrate MedTVT-R1's superiority in multimodal feature

Method: Proposes slide indexing and component stacking for equivariance, then introduces adaptive sliding indexing to balance computational cost and receptive field.

Result: TEAFormer shows superior performance in image restoration tasks, improving effectiveness, convergence, and generalization.

Conclusion: The adaptive strategies in TEAFormer successfully preserve translation equivariance, enhancing model performance in restoration tasks.

Abstract: Translation equivariance is a fundamental inductive bias in image
restoration, ensuring that translated inputs produce translated outputs.
Attention mechanisms in modern restoration transformers undermine this
property, adversely impacting both training convergence and generalization. To
alleviate this issue, we propose two key strategies for incorporating
translation equivariance: slide indexing and component stacking. Slide indexing
maintains operator responses at fixed positions, with sliding window attention
being a notable example, while component stacking enables the arrangement of
translation-equivariant operators in parallel or sequentially, thereby building
complex architectures while preserving translation equivariance. However, these
strategies still create a dilemma in model design between the high
computational cost of self-attention and the fixed receptive field associated
with sliding window attention. To address this, we develop an adaptive sliding
indexing mechanism to efficiently select key-value pairs for each query, which
are then concatenated in parallel with globally aggregated key-value pairs. The
designed network, called the Translation Equivariance Adaptive Transformer
(TEAFormer), is assessed across a variety of image restoration tasks. The
results highlight its superiority in terms of effectiveness, training
convergence, and generalization.

TL;DR: A method for embedding malignant lymphoma pathology images in hyperbolic space using self-supervised learning to capture hierarchical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To represent pathology images across scales (cell nuclei to tissue) and capture morphological changes during disease progression.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning to embed tissue and nucleus images in a hyperbolic space (PoincarÃ© ball) based on inclusion relationships.

Result: Learned representations effectively encode hierarchical structure, capturing disease state and cell type variations.

Conclusion: The approach successfully models hierarchical relationships in pathology images, aiding in disease analysis.

Abstract: We propose a method for representing malignant lymphoma pathology images,
from high-resolution cell nuclei to low-resolution tissue images, within a
single hyperbolic space using self-supervised learning. To capture
morphological changes that occur across scales during disease progression, our
approach embeds tissue and corresponding nucleus images close to each other
based on inclusion relationships. Using the Poincar\'e ball as the feature
space enables effective encoding of this hierarchical structure. The learned
representations capture both disease state and cell type variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MV-AR, an auto-regressive model for generating consistent multi-view images from diverse prompts, addressing challenges like view consistency and multi-modal condition handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient 3D content creation by generating multi-view images from human instructions while maintaining consistency and handling diverse conditions.

Method: Proposes MV-AR, leveraging auto-regressive models for progressive multi-view synthesis, condition injection modules for diverse prompts, and a progressive training strategy. Introduces 'Shuffle View' data augmentation to mitigate overfitting.

Result: MV-AR consistently generates high-quality multi-view images under various conditions, matching the performance of leading diffusion-based models.

Conclusion: MV-AR is a versatile and effective solution for multi-view image generation, with potential applications in 3D content creation.

Abstract: Generating multi-view images from human instructions is crucial for 3D
content creation. The primary challenges involve maintaining consistency across
multiple views and effectively synthesizing shapes and textures under diverse
conditions. In this paper, we propose the Multi-View Auto-Regressive (MV-AR)
method, which leverages an auto-regressive model to progressively generate
consistent multi-view images from arbitrary prompts. Firstly, the
next-token-prediction capability of the AR model significantly enhances its
effectiveness in facilitating progressive multi-view synthesis. When generating
widely-separated views, MV-AR can utilize all its preceding views to extract
effective reference information. Subsequently, we propose a unified model that
accommodates various prompts via architecture designing and training
strategies. To address multiple conditions, we introduce condition injection
modules for text, camera pose, image, and shape. To manage multi-modal
conditions simultaneously, a progressive training strategy is employed. This
strategy initially adopts the text-to-multi-view (t2mv) model as a baseline to
enhance the development of a comprehensive X-to-multi-view (X2mv) model through
the randomly dropping and combining conditions. Finally, to alleviate the
overfitting problem caused by limited high-quality data, we propose the
"Shuffle View" data augmentation technique, thus significantly expanding the
training data by several magnitudes. Experiments demonstrate the performance
and versatility of our MV-AR, which consistently generates consistent
multi-view images across a range of conditions and performs on par with leading
diffusion-based multi-view image generation models. Code and models will be
released at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MVAR.

*Pengxiang Li,Wei Wu,Zhi Gao,Xiaomeng Fan,Peilin Yu,Yuwei Wu,Zhipeng Lu,Yunde Jia,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HS2SD, a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure integrating global and local structural information for better dissimilarity computation in hyperbolic space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data points, where both local and global structures are semantically important.

Method: HS2SD combines geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints (global) and topological differences using Thue-Morse sequences (local).

Result: Outperforms existing methods in entity matching and image classification tasks by modeling hierarchical relationships.

Conclusion: HS2SD effectively captures complex relationships in hyperbolic sets, offering superior performance in practical applications.

Abstract: We propose a hyperbolic set-to-set distance measure for computing
dissimilarity between sets in hyperbolic space. While point-to-point distances
in hyperbolic space effectively capture hierarchical relationships between data
points, many real-world applications require comparing sets of hyperbolic data
points, where the local structure and the global structure of the sets carry
crucial semantic information. The proposed the \underline{h}yperbolic
\underline{s}et-\underline{to}-\underline{s}et \underline{d}istance measure
(HS2SD) integrates both global and local structural information: global
structure through geodesic distances between Einstein midpoints of hyperbolic
sets, and local structure through topological characteristics of the two sets.
To efficiently compute topological differences, we prove that using a finite
Thue-Morse sequence of degree and adjacency matrices can serve as a robust
approximation to capture the topological structure of a set. In this case, by
considering the topological differences, HS2SD provides a more nuanced
understanding of the relationships between two hyperbolic sets. Empirical
evaluation on entity matching, standard image classification, and few-shot
image classification demonstrates that our distance measure outperforms
existing methods by effectively modeling the hierarchical and complex
relationships inherent in hyperbolic sets.

*Pengxiang Li,Yuwei Wu,Zhi Gao,Xiaomeng Fan,Wei Wu,Zhipeng Lu,Yunde Jia,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a geometry-aware distance measure in hyperbolic spaces, adapting to diverse hierarchical structures, outperforming fixed-distance methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hyperbolic learning methods assume uniform hierarchy, but real-world structures are diverse, requiring adaptive measures.

Method: Introduces tailored projections and curvatures for each data pair, with low-rank decomposition and hard-pair mining to reduce computational cost.

Result: Outperforms fixed-distance methods, achieving over 5% gains on few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet).

Conclusion: Adaptive distance measures better capture hierarchical diversity, improving class boundaries and prototype separation.

Abstract: Learning in hyperbolic spaces has attracted increasing attention due to its
superior ability to model hierarchical structures of data. Most existing
hyperbolic learning methods use fixed distance measures for all data, assuming
a uniform hierarchy across all data points. However, real-world hierarchical
structures exhibit significant diversity, making this assumption overly
restrictive. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware distance measure in
hyperbolic spaces, which dynamically adapts to varying hierarchical structures.
Our approach derives the distance measure by generating tailored projections
and curvatures for each pair of data points, effectively mapping them to an
appropriate hyperbolic space. We introduce a revised low-rank decomposition
scheme and a hard-pair mining mechanism to mitigate the computational cost of
pair-wise distance computation without compromising accuracy. We present an
upper bound on the low-rank approximation error using Talagrand's concentration
inequality, ensuring theoretical robustness. Extensive experiments on standard
image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100), hierarchical
classification (5-level CIFAR-100), and few-shot learning tasks (mini-ImageNet,
tiered-ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach
consistently outperforms learning methods that use fixed distance measures,
with notable improvements on few-shot learning tasks, where it achieves over
5\% gains on mini-ImageNet. The results reveal that adaptive distance measures
better capture diverse hierarchical structures, with visualization showing
clearer class boundaries and improved prototype separation in hyperbolic
spaces.

### [136] [Normality Prior Guided Multi-Semantic Fusion Network for Unsupervised Image Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18544)
*Muhao Xu,Xueying Zhou,Xizhan Gao,Weiye Song,Guang Feng,Sijie Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network is proposed for unsupervised anomaly detection, improving performance on logical anomalies by leveraging multi-semantic features of normal samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logical anomalies are harder to detect than structural ones due to their local resemblance to normal features but global deviation. Existing methods fail as anomalies propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.

Method: Extracts global semantics of normal cases using a pre-trained vision-language network, constructs learnable semantic codebooks, and fuses multi-semantic features to guide anomaly reconstruction.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on MVTec LOCO AD dataset with 5.7% improvement in pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses logical anomaly detection by integrating multi-semantic normality priors, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, detecting logical anomalies is becoming a more challenging task
compared to detecting structural ones. Existing encoder decoder based methods
typically compress inputs into low-dimensional bottlenecks on the assumption
that the compression process can effectively suppress the transmission of
logical anomalies to the decoder. However, logical anomalies present a
particular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal
semantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.
Thanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these
abnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.
This ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with
misleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel
normality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly
detection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder
directly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the
reconstruction process. To this end, we first extract abstract global semantics
of normal cases by a pre-trained vision-language network, then the learnable
semantic codebooks are constructed to store representative feature vectors of
normal samples by vector quantisation. Finally, the above multi-semantic
features are fused and employed as input to the decoder to guide the
reconstruction of anomalies to approximate normality. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and it achieves
the SOTA performance on the MVTec LOCO AD dataset with improvements of 5.7% in
pixel-sPRO and 2.6% in image-AUROC. The source code is available at

*Sung Jin Um,Dongjin Kim,Sangmin Lee,Jung Uk Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improves sound source localization by distinguishing sound-making objects from silent ones with new loss functions (OCA and ORI).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in complex scenes due to reliance on simple audio-visual correspondence, missing fine-grained semantic differences.

Method: Proposes a framework with MLLMs for contextual information and introduces OCA and ORI loss functions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets in single and multi-source scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses localization challenges in complex scenes, leveraging detailed contextual information and novel loss functions.

Abstract: Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize
sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues.
However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making
objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects
coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple
audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic
differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual
information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground
objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed
information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive
Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss. Extensive
experimental results on MUSIC and VGGSound datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming existing methods in
both single-source and multi-source localization scenarios. Code and generated
detailed contextual information are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-Insight is a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for AIGC video quality assessment, addressing challenges like limited generalization and lack of temporal awareness. It outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating AIGC-generated videos face issues like limited generalization, lack of temporal awareness, and reliance on large annotated datasets.

Method: VQ-Insight combines image quality warm-up, task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with video generation models, using multi-dimension scoring and preference comparison rewards.

Result: VQ-Insight outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring, and natural video scoring.

Conclusion: VQ-Insight significantly improves video generation tasks by enhancing video quality assessment.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-generated content (AIGC) have led to the emergence of
powerful text-to-video generation models. Despite these successes, evaluating
the quality of AIGC-generated videos remains challenging due to limited
generalization, lack of temporal awareness, heavy reliance on large-scale
annotated datasets, and the lack of effective interaction with generation
models. Most current approaches rely on supervised finetuning of
vision-language models (VLMs), which often require large-scale annotated
datasets and tend to decouple understanding and generation. To address these
shortcomings, we propose VQ-Insight, a novel reasoning-style VLM framework for
AIGC video quality assessment. Our approach features: (1) a progressive video
quality learning scheme that combines image quality warm-up, general
task-specific temporal learning, and joint optimization with the video
generation model; (2) the design of multi-dimension scoring rewards, preference
comparison rewards, and temporal modeling rewards to enhance both
generalization and specialization in video quality evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VQ-Insight consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in preference comparison, multi-dimension scoring,
and natural video scoring, bringing significant improvements for video
generation tasks.

*Oleh Kuzyk,Zuoyue Li,Marc Pollefeys,Xi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualChef generates contextual visual aids for cooking by creating images of actions and outcomes, simplifying alignment with mask-based grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooking lacks consistent visual guidance; existing methods require complex textual alignment. VisualChef aims to simplify this.

Method: Uses mask-based visual grounding to identify action-relevant objects, enabling targeted modifications while preserving the environment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three egocentric video datasets.

Conclusion: VisualChef effectively supports cooking with tailored visual aids, simplifying alignment and improving consistency.

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding,
executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without
visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they
often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the
cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual
visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a
specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's
execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the
initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge
extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual
descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained
visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast,
VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key
insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable
targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while
maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated
pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We
evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video
datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

*Kaifeng Sheng,Zheng Zhou,Yingliang Peng,Qianwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a method replacing 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets for better rendering speed and effects like relighting, while maintaining volumetric modeling benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in rendering speed and advanced effects (e.g., relighting) faced by 3D Gaussian primitives, compared to mesh-based models.

Method: Proposes 2DTS, using 2D triangle facelets with a compactness parameter to train photorealistic meshes, forming a mesh-like structure.

Result: Achieves higher fidelity than Gaussian-based methods and superior visual quality in mesh reconstruction.

Conclusion: 2DTS offers a promising alternative to 3D Gaussian primitives, balancing rendering efficiency and advanced effects.

Abstract: Differentiable rendering with 3D Gaussian primitives has emerged as a
powerful method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D scenes from multi-view
images. While it offers improvements over NeRF-based methods, this
representation still encounters challenges with rendering speed and advanced
rendering effects, such as relighting and shadow rendering, compared to
mesh-based models. In this paper, we propose 2D Triangle Splatting (2DTS), a
novel method that replaces 3D Gaussian primitives with 2D triangle facelets.
This representation naturally forms a discrete mesh-like structure while
retaining the benefits of continuous volumetric modeling. By incorporating a
compactness parameter into the triangle primitives, we enable direct training
of photorealistic meshes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
triangle-based method, in its vanilla version (without compactness tuning),
achieves higher fidelity compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based methods.
Furthermore, our approach produces reconstructed meshes with superior visual
quality compared to existing mesh reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: A novel resampling-based augmentation for contrastive learning in Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) outperforms common methods and achieves state-of-the-art results without spatial or temporal encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage abundant unlabeled SITS data for self-supervised learning, addressing the challenge of designing effective augmentations for time series.

Method: Introduces a resampling-based augmentation strategy that upsamples time series and extracts disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage.

Result: Outperforms common alternatives (jittering, resizing, masking) on agricultural benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on S2-Agri100.

Conclusion: The method provides a simple yet effective contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing time series.

Abstract: Given the abundance of unlabeled Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) and the
scarcity of labeled data, contrastive self-supervised pretraining emerges as a
natural tool to leverage this vast quantity of unlabeled data. However,
designing effective data augmentations for contrastive learning remains
challenging for time series. We introduce a novel resampling-based augmentation
strategy that generates positive pairs by upsampling time series and extracting
disjoint subsequences while preserving temporal coverage. We validate our
approach on multiple agricultural classification benchmarks using Sentinel-2
imagery, showing that it outperforms common alternatives such as jittering,
resizing, and masking. Further, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
S2-Agri100 dataset without employing spatial information or temporal encodings,
surpassing more complex masked-based SSL frameworks. Our method offers a
simple, yet effective, contrastive learning augmentation for remote sensing
time series.

*Mauricio Byrd Victorica,GyÃ¶rgy DÃ¡n,Henrik Sandberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaNN is a novel attack detector for adversarial patches in CNNs, independent of patch count, using binarized feature maps and clustering for robust detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses against adversarial patches are limited to single-patch attacks or are computationally inefficient for multiple patches.

Method: SpaNN builds an ensemble of binarized feature maps from the first convolutional layer, performs clustering, and uses cluster features for attack detection.

Result: SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art defenses by up to 11% (object detection) and 27% (image classification) on four datasets.

Conclusion: SpaNN provides a robust and efficient solution for detecting adversarial patches, improving upon existing methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art convolutional neural network models for object detection and
image classification are vulnerable to physically realizable adversarial
perturbations, such as patch attacks. Existing defenses have focused,
implicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to
the number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally
infeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the
worst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose
computational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial
patches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble
of binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the
neural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It
then performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the
input to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,
SpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial
regions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We
evaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and
classification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art
defenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection
and the case of image classification, respectively. Our code is available at

TL;DR: RDPO is an annotation-free framework that improves video generation by distilling physical priors from real-world videos, enhancing physical realism without costly human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation techniques lack physical consistency, and preference-based post-training methods are costly or infeasible.

Method: RDPO reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to create preference pairs for training, using a multi-stage iterative schedule.

Result: RDPO significantly improves action coherence and physical realism in generated videos, as validated by benchmarks and human evaluations.

Conclusion: RDPO offers a scalable and effective solution for enhancing physical realism in video generation without relying on costly annotations.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have achieved remarkable advancements in visual
quality, yet faithfully reproducing real-world physics remains elusive.
Preference-based model post-training may improve physical consistency, but
requires costly human-annotated datasets or reward models that are not yet
feasible. To address these challenges, we present Real Data Preference
Optimisation (RDPO), an annotation-free framework that distills physical priors
directly from real-world videos. Specifically, the proposed RDPO
reverse-samples real video sequences with a pre-trained generator to
automatically build preference pairs that are statistically distinguishable in
terms of physical correctness. A multi-stage iterative training schedule then
guides the generator to obey physical laws increasingly well. Benefiting from
the dynamic information explored from real videos, our proposed RDPO
significantly improves the action coherence and physical realism of the
generated videos. Evaluations on multiple benchmarks and human evaluations have
demonstrated that RDPO achieves improvements across multiple dimensions. The

TL;DR: BiGen is a framework for generating pathology reports from WSIs by integrating visual and textual knowledge, improving semantic content and reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of semantic content in visual features and information redundancy in WSIs for automated pathology report generation.

Method: Uses a knowledge retrieval mechanism and bi-modal concurrent learning with shared layers to align visual and textual features, integrated by a multi-modal decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 7.4% improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1% in Her-2 prediction, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: BiGen effectively enhances report generation by leveraging cross-modal alignment and suppressing redundancy, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Automated pathology report generation from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) faces
two key challenges: (1) lack of semantic content in visual features and (2)
inherent information redundancy in WSIs. To address these issues, we propose a
novel Historical Report Guided \textbf{Bi}-modal Concurrent Learning Framework
for Pathology Report \textbf{Gen}eration (BiGen) emulating pathologists'
diagnostic reasoning, consisting of: (1) A knowledge retrieval mechanism to
provide rich semantic content, which retrieves WSI-relevant knowledge from
pre-built medical knowledge bank by matching high-attention patches and (2) A
bi-modal concurrent learning strategy instantiated via a learnable visual token
and a learnable textual token to dynamically extract key visual features and
retrieved knowledge, where weight-shared layers enable cross-modal alignment
between visual features and knowledge features. Our multi-modal decoder
integrates both modals for comprehensive diagnostic reports generation.
Experiments on the PathText (BRCA) dataset demonstrate our framework's
superiority, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.4\% relative
improvement in NLP metrics and 19.1\% enhancement in classification metrics for
Her-2 prediction versus existing methods. Ablation studies validate the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating histopathology foundation models (FMs) as patch-level feature extractors in MIL frameworks, using the AI4SkIN dataset and introducing the FM-SI metric to measure model consistency against distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diversity of histopathology FMs necessitates real-world challenges to evaluate their effectiveness, especially in automated whole slide image analysis requiring MIL frameworks.

Method: Developed a novel benchmark leveraging the AI4SkIN dataset and introduced the FM-SI metric to assess model consistency. Evaluated FMs as patch-level feature extractors within MIL classification.

Result: Extracting less biased features improves classification performance, particularly in similarity-based MIL classifiers.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark and FM-SI metric effectively evaluate histopathology FMs, demonstrating the importance of unbiased feature extraction for enhanced performance.

Abstract: Pretraining on large-scale, in-domain datasets grants histopathology
foundation models (FM) the ability to learn task-agnostic data representations,
enhancing transfer learning on downstream tasks. In computational pathology,
automated whole slide image analysis requires multiple instance learning (MIL)
frameworks due to the gigapixel scale of the slides. The diversity among
histopathology FMs has highlighted the need to design real-world challenges for
evaluating their effectiveness. To bridge this gap, our work presents a novel
benchmark for evaluating histopathology FMs as patch-level feature extractors
within a MIL classification framework. For that purpose, we leverage the
AI4SkIN dataset, a multi-center cohort encompassing slides with challenging
cutaneous spindle cell neoplasm subtypes. We also define the Foundation Model -
Silhouette Index (FM-SI), a novel metric to measure model consistency against
distribution shifts. Our experimentation shows that extracting less biased
features enhances classification performance, especially in similarity-based
MIL classifiers.

*Hao Shao,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSeg-R is a lightweight, dual-stage framework for medical image segmentation that integrates semantic priors from medical reports to improve accuracy, especially for small lesions and ambiguous boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with low-contrast or overlapping targets due to reliance on local cues or user prompts, lacking integrated semantic priors.

Method: MedSeg-R uses a cognitive stage to interpret medical reports into semantic priors (location, texture, shape) and a perceptual stage to modulate the SAM backbone with these priors via spatial attention, dynamic convolution, and deformable sampling.

Result: MedSeg-R significantly improves Dice scores for overlapping and ambiguous structures, enhancing sensitivity to small lesions.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based systems and effectively addresses challenges in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to overlapping anatomies with
ambiguous boundaries and a severe imbalance between the foreground and
background classes, which particularly affects the delineation of small
lesions. Existing methods, including encoder-decoder networks and prompt-driven
variants of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), rely heavily on local cues or
user prompts and lack integrated semantic priors, thus failing to generalize
well to low-contrast or overlapping targets. To address these issues, we
propose MedSeg-R, a lightweight, dual-stage framework inspired by inspired by
clinical reasoning. Its cognitive stage interprets medical report into
structured semantic priors (location, texture, shape), which are fused via
transformer block. In the perceptual stage, these priors modulate the SAM
backbone: spatial attention highlights likely lesion regions, dynamic
convolution adapts feature filters to expected textures, and deformable
sampling refines spatial support. By embedding this fine-grained guidance
early, MedSeg-R disentangles inter-class confusion and amplifies minority-class
cues, greatly improving sensitivity to small lesions. In challenging
benchmarks, MedSeg-R produces large Dice improvements in overlapping and
ambiguous structures, demonstrating plug-and-play compatibility with SAM-based
systems.

TL;DR: A novel multiview dataset of a lab-based tornado is introduced, enabling 3D reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) to study tornado structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding tornado structures is crucial for disaster preparedness, but lacks controlled datasets for validation.

Method: Captured a lab-based tornado dataset and applied 3DGS for reconstruction.

Result: Successfully reconstructed and visualized the 3D structure of the tornado.

Conclusion: The dataset and 3DGS method provide a foundation for future tornado research and tool development.

Abstract: Accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of tornadoes is critically
important for understanding and preparing for this highly destructive weather
phenomenon. While modern 3D scene reconstruction techniques, such as 3D
Gaussian splatting (3DGS), could provide a valuable tool for reconstructing the
3D structure of tornados, at present we are critically lacking a controlled
tornado dataset with which to develop and validate these tools. In this work we
capture and release a novel multiview dataset of a small lab-based tornado. We
demonstrate one can effectively reconstruct and visualize the 3D structure of
this tornado using 3DGS.

*Tianchen Deng,Guole Shen,Xun Chen,Shenghai Yuan,Hongming Shen,Guohao Peng,Zhenyu Wu,Jingchuan Wang,Lihua Xie,Danwei Wang,Hesheng Wang,Weidong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with hybrid scene representation, addressing limitations in existing methods for large-scale scenes and multi-agent scenarios. It introduces novel techniques for scene reconstruction, loop closure, and submap fusion, along with a new real-world dataset for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural implicit SLAM methods are limited to single-agent scenarios and struggle with large-scale scenes and long sequences. Current multi-agent SLAM frameworks face communication bandwidth constraints.

Method: The framework includes hybrid scene representation (triplane-grid), distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop closure, and online distillation for submap fusion. A new real-world dataset (DES) is also introduced.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in mapping, tracking, and communication efficiency, as demonstrated by experiments.

Conclusion: The framework advances multi-agent SLAM and 3D reconstruction, supported by the new DES dataset, which will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results
in dense visual SLAM. However, existing implicit SLAM algorithms are
constrained to single-agent scenarios, and fall difficulties in large-scale
scenes and long sequences. Existing NeRF-based multi-agent SLAM frameworks
cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end, we propose
the first distributed multi-agent collaborative neural SLAM framework with
hybrid scene representation, distributed camera tracking, intra-to-inter loop
closure, and online distillation for multiple submap fusion. A novel
triplane-grid joint scene representation method is proposed to improve scene
reconstruction. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to
achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. We also
design a novel online distillation method to fuse the information of different
submaps to achieve global consistency. Furthermore, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that
provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D
meshes groundtruth. To this end, we propose the first real-world Dense slam
(DES) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, ranging
from small rooms to large-scale outdoor scenes, with high-accuracy ground truth
for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can
advance the development of the research in both SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and
visual foundation model. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in both mapping, tracking, and
communication. The dataset and code will open-source on
https://github.com/dtc111111/mcnslam.

*Ruicheng Zhang,Yu Sun,Zeyu Zhang,Jinai Li,Xiaofan Liu,Au Hoi Fan,Haowei Guo,Puxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MARL-MambaContour is a novel contour-based medical image segmentation framework using MARL, optimizing contour alignment with SAC and ERAM, and improving inter-agent communication with BCHFM, achieving top performance on medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-based segmentation lacks topological constraints and structural awareness, prompting the need for a contour-based approach with MARL for better accuracy.

Method: Models contour points as agents adjusting iteratively with SAC and ERAM. Uses a Mamba-based policy network with BCHFM for improved inter-agent communication.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on five diverse medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: MARL-MambaContour is accurate and robust, suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: We introduce MARL-MambaContour, the first contour-based medical image
segmentation framework based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Our
approach reframes segmentation as a multi-agent cooperation task focused on
generate topologically consistent object-level contours, addressing the
limitations of traditional pixel-based methods which could lack topological
constraints and holistic structural awareness of anatomical regions. Each
contour point is modeled as an autonomous agent that iteratively adjusts its
position to align precisely with the target boundary, enabling adaptation to
blurred edges and intricate morphologies common in medical images. This
iterative adjustment process is optimized by a contour-specific Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, further enhanced with the Entropy Regularization
Adjustment Mechanism (ERAM) which dynamically balance agent exploration with
contour smoothness. Furthermore, the framework incorporates a Mamba-based
policy network featuring a novel Bidirectional Cross-attention Hidden-state
Fusion Mechanism (BCHFM). This mechanism mitigates potential memory confusion
limitations associated with long-range modeling in state space models, thereby
facilitating more accurate inter-agent information exchange and informed
decision-making. Extensive experiments on five diverse medical imaging datasets
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MARL-MambaContour, highlighting
its potential as an accurate and robust clinical application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently processing high-dimensional HSI data for better environmental perception in challenging conditions.

Method: MSAM uses three parallel 1D convolutions with varying kernel sizes (1-11) and adaptive feature aggregation, integrated into UNet's skip connections.

Result: UNet-MSAM outperforms UNet-SC with 3.61% mean IoU and 3.80% mF1 improvements, adding only 0.02% parameters and 0.82% GFLOPS.

Conclusion: Multi-scale kernel combinations enhance HSI processing for autonomous driving, offering insights for robust spectral feature extractors.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving (AD) have highlighted the potential of
Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) for enhanced environmental perception, particularly
in challenging weather and lighting conditions. However, efficiently processing
its high-dimensional spectral data remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces a Multi-scale Spectral Attention Module (MSAM) that enhances
spectral feature extraction through three parallel 1D convolutions with varying
kernel sizes between 1 to 11, coupled with an adaptive feature aggregation
mechanism. By integrating MSAM into UNet's skip connections (UNet-SC), our
proposed UNet-MSAM achieves significant improvements in semantic segmentation
performance across multiple HSI datasets: HyKo-VIS v2, HSI-Drive v2, and
Hyperspectral City v2. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that with
minimal computational overhead (on average 0.02% in parameters and 0.82%
GFLOPS), UNet-MSAM consistently outperforms UNet-SC, achieving average
improvements of 3.61% in mean IoU and 3.80% in mF1 across the three datasets.
Through extensive ablation studies, we have established that multi-scale kernel
combinations perform better than single-scale configurations. These findings
demonstrate the potential of HSI processing for AD and provide valuable
insights into designing robust, multi-scale spectral feature extractors for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance classification performance for digitized herbarium specimens, which face challenges like heterogeneous backgrounds and occlusions.

Method: Uses pixel-to-point transformation to convert 2D masks into 3D point clouds, fusing CNN and PointNet features in a unified latent space.

Result: Outperforms ResNet101 by up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score, surpassing transformer-based models.

Conclusion: Incorporating 3D structural reasoning benefits 2D image classification, especially for complex datasets like herbarium specimens.

Abstract: We introduce the Shape-Image Multimodal Network (SIM-Net), a novel 2D image
classification architecture that integrates 3D point cloud representations
inferred directly from RGB images. Our key contribution lies in a
pixel-to-point transformation that converts 2D object masks into 3D point
clouds, enabling the fusion of texture-based and geometric features for
enhanced classification performance. SIM-Net is particularly well-suited for
the classification of digitized herbarium specimens (a task made challenging by
heterogeneous backgrounds), non-plant elements, and occlusions that compromise
conventional image-based models. To address these issues, SIM-Net employs a
segmentation-based preprocessing step to extract object masks prior to 3D point
cloud generation. The architecture comprises a CNN encoder for 2D image
features and a PointNet-based encoder for geometric features, which are fused
into a unified latent space. Experimental evaluations on herbarium datasets
demonstrate that SIM-Net consistently outperforms ResNet101, achieving gains of
up to 9.9% in accuracy and 12.3% in F-score. It also surpasses several
transformer-based state-of-the-art architectures, highlighting the benefits of
incorporating 3D structural reasoning into 2D image classification tasks.

Conclusion: Matrix-Game sets a new standard for interactive world generation, with plans to open-source the model and benchmark for future research.

Abstract: We introduce Matrix-Game, an interactive world foundation model for
controllable game world generation. Matrix-Game is trained using a two-stage
pipeline that first performs large-scale unlabeled pretraining for environment
understanding, followed by action-labeled training for interactive video
generation. To support this, we curate Matrix-Game-MC, a comprehensive
Minecraft dataset comprising over 2,700 hours of unlabeled gameplay video clips
and over 1,000 hours of high-quality labeled clips with fine-grained keyboard
and mouse action annotations. Our model adopts a controllable image-to-world
generation paradigm, conditioned on a reference image, motion context, and user
actions. With over 17 billion parameters, Matrix-Game enables precise control
over character actions and camera movements, while maintaining high visual
quality and temporal coherence. To evaluate performance, we develop GameWorld
Score, a unified benchmark measuring visual quality, temporal quality, action
controllability, and physical rule understanding for Minecraft world
generation. Extensive experiments show that Matrix-Game consistently
outperforms prior open-source Minecraft world models (including Oasis and
MineWorld) across all metrics, with particularly strong gains in
controllability and physical consistency. Double-blind human evaluations
further confirm the superiority of Matrix-Game, highlighting its ability to
generate perceptually realistic and precisely controllable videos across
diverse game scenarios. To facilitate future research on interactive

TL;DR: A novel skeleton-based action recognition method uses word embeddings to encode semantic information, improving performance and generalization in assembly tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional skeleton-based methods lose keypoint semantics, limiting effectiveness in complex interactions.

Method: Replaces one-hot encodings with semantic volumes to capture relationships between joints and objects.

Result: Significantly improves classification performance and supports different skeleton types and object classes.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic information enhances skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Effective human action recognition is widely used for cobots in Industry 4.0

In this work, we introduce a novel approach to skeleton-based action

semantic volumes, enabling the model to capture meaningful relationships
between joints and objects. Through extensive experiments on multiple assembly

simultaneously supporting different skeleton types and object classes. Our
findings highlight the potential of incorporating semantic information to
enhance skeleton-based action recognition in dynamic and diverse environments.

*Aman Bhatta,Michael C. King,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a revocable biometric scheme using deep CNN face matchers, showing they can generate unlimited distinct models with equivalent recognition power and incompatible templates, making compromised templates worthless. Vision Transformers are less suitable for this purpose.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of recourse in biometric authentication when a biometric is compromised by developing a revocable scheme.

Method: Utilize deep CNN face matchers to generate multiple distinct models with equivalent recognition power and incompatible templates. Compare with Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones.

Result: Deep CNN models allow unlimited revocable templates with strong incompatibility, making stolen templates useless. ViT backbones are less effective.

Conclusion: Deep CNN-based face matchers inherently support robust revocable biometric schemes, while ViT backbones are less suitable.

Abstract: One common critique of biometric authentication is that if an individual's
biometric is compromised, then the individual has no recourse. The concept of
revocable biometrics was developed to address this concern. A biometric scheme
is revocable if an individual can have their current enrollment in the scheme
revoked, so that the compromised biometric template becomes worthless, and the
individual can re-enroll with a new template that has similar recognition
power. We show that modern deep CNN face matchers inherently allow for a robust
revocable biometric scheme. For a given state-of-the-art deep CNN backbone and
training set, it is possible to generate an unlimited number of distinct face
matcher models that have both (1) equivalent recognition power, and (2)
strongly incompatible biometric templates. The equivalent recognition power
extends to the point of generating impostor and genuine distributions that have
the same shape and placement on the similarity dimension, meaning that the
models can share a similarity threshold for a 1-in-10,000 false match rate. The
biometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible
that the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is
typically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different
persons. That is, a stolen biometric template that is revoked is of less value
in attempting to match the re-enrolled identity than the average impostor
template. We also explore the feasibility of using a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone-based face matcher in the revocable biometric system proposed in this
work and demonstrate that it is less suitable compared to typical ResNet-based
deep CNN backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA) to improve Semantic Occupancy Prediction (SOP) in autonomous driving by incorporating local spatial context into attention, addressing limitations of existing transformer-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer-based SOP methods lack explicit spatial structure modeling, leading to poor performance in sparse or occluded areas.

Method: Proposes SWA, a mechanism that integrates local spatial context into attention computation for better geometric awareness.

Result: SWA achieves state-of-the-art results on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks and shows consistent improvements in camera-based SOP.

Conclusion: SWA enhances SOP by improving scene completion and generalizes well across sensor modalities.

Abstract: Perception systems in autonomous driving rely on sensors such as LiDAR and
cameras to perceive the 3D environment. However, due to occlusions and data
sparsity, these sensors often fail to capture complete information. Semantic
Occupancy Prediction (SOP) addresses this challenge by inferring both occupancy
and semantics of unobserved regions. Existing transformer-based SOP methods
lack explicit modeling of spatial structure in attention computation, resulting
in limited geometric awareness and poor performance in sparse or occluded
areas. To this end, we propose Spatially-aware Window Attention (SWA), a novel
mechanism that incorporates local spatial context into attention. SWA
significantly improves scene completion and achieves state-of-the-art results
on LiDAR-based SOP benchmarks. We further validate its generality by
integrating SWA into a camera-based SOP pipeline, where it also yields
consistent gains across modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D model evaluation lacks alignment with human perception, relying on inadequate metrics. The goal is to bridge this gap with human-centered evaluation.

Method: 3D Arena uses large-scale human preference collection via pairwise comparisons, statistical fraud detection, and an ELO-based ranking system.

Result: Findings show Gaussian splats and textured models are preferred, with a 16.6 and 144.1 ELO advantage, respectively.

Conclusion: 3D Arena advances human-centered evaluation in Generative 3D, offering recommendations for improved assessment methods and establishing a benchmark.

Abstract: Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment
between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks
rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that
fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap,
we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation
models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise
comparisons.
  Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from

preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100
evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user
authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system
provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established
evaluation resource.
  Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human
preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation
features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over
meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured
models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including
multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware

TL;DR: A novel Super-Pixel Based Patch Pooling (SPPP) and Light Latent Attention (LLA) module are introduced to reduce computational and memory demands in Vision Transformers, improving efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges like high computational costs, memory usage, and energy inefficiency in Vision Transformers, especially due to self-attention mechanisms, motivate the need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Proposes SPPP for context-aware patch embeddings and LLA for reduced attention complexity, integrating dynamic positional encodings for targeted attention.

Result: Achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods with significant computational efficiency gains, suitable for edge deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed SPPP and LLA modules offer a lightweight, efficient alternative for Vision Transformers, enhancing training and deployment feasibility.

Abstract: The evolution of Vision Transformers has led to their widespread adaptation
to different domains. Despite large-scale success, there remain significant
challenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory
resources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in
task-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy
inefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention
mechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch
Pooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch
embeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve
efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module
in our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism
allowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch
embeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively
modulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while
maintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves
training efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is
lightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer
architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed architecture
provides significant improvements in terms of computational efficiency while
achieving comparable results with the state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting
its potential for energy-efficient transformers suitable for edge deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic novel view synthesis from monocular video is challenging due to ill-posed structure-motion disentanglement and scarce supervision.

Method: ViDAR uses personalized diffusion models for pseudo multi-view supervision, a diffusion-aware loss function, and camera pose optimization to align synthetic views with scene geometry.

Result: ViDAR outperforms baselines on DyCheck benchmark in visual quality and geometric consistency, especially in dynamic regions.

Conclusion: ViDAR effectively addresses monocular ambiguity and spatio-temporal inconsistency, setting a new benchmark for motion-rich scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving
subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when
relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is
ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware
Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages
personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision
signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on
scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while
mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the
spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a
diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that
aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on
DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that
ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and
geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over
baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance
in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing occlusion and incomplete scene data challenges in autonomous driving perception.

Method: Proposes OC-SOP, integrating object-centric cues from a detection branch into SOP.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI, especially for foreground objects.

Conclusion: OC-SOP effectively enhances semantic occupancy prediction by leveraging object-centric information.

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception faces significant challenges due to occlusions
and incomplete scene data in the environment. To overcome these issues, the
task of semantic occupancy prediction (SOP) is proposed, which aims to jointly
infer both the geometry and semantic labels of a scene from images. However,
conventional camera-based methods typically treat all categories equally and
primarily rely on local features, leading to suboptimal predictions, especially
for dynamic foreground objects. To address this, we propose Object-Centric SOP
(OC-SOP), a framework that integrates high-level object-centric cues extracted
via a detection branch into the semantic occupancy prediction pipeline. This
object-centric integration significantly enhances the prediction accuracy for
foreground objects and achieves state-of-the-art performance among all
categories on SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: PicoSAM2 demonstrates efficient, on-device segmentation, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud reliance.

Abstract: Real-time, on-device segmentation is critical for latency-sensitive and
privacy-aware applications like smart glasses and IoT devices. We introduce
PicoSAM2, a lightweight (1.3M parameters, 336M MACs) promptable segmentation
model optimized for edge and in-sensor execution, including the Sony IMX500. It
builds on a depthwise separable U-Net, with knowledge distillation and

the only model meeting both memory and compute constraints for in-sensor
deployment. Distillation boosts LVIS performance by +3.5% mIoU and +5.1% mAP.
These results demonstrate that efficient, promptable segmentation is feasible
directly on-camera, enabling privacy-preserving vision without cloud or host
processing.

*Chaoyang Wang,Ashkan Mirzaei,Vidit Goel,Willi Menapace,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Avalon Vinella,Michael Vasilkovsky,Ivan Skorokhodov,Vladislav Shakhrai,Sergey Korolev,Sergey Tulyakov,Peter Wonka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for 4D video and 3D Gaussian particle computation using a fused attention architecture and improved reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing 4D video diffusion architectures and enhance 3D reconstruction capabilities for better visual quality and accuracy.

Method: Introduces a fused architecture for spatial and temporal attention in a single layer, alongside a Gaussian head, camera token replacement, and dynamic layers for reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D generation, improving visual quality and reconstruction capability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully advances 4D video and 3D reconstruction, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: We propose the first framework capable of computing a 4D spatio-temporal grid
of video frames and 3D Gaussian particles for each time step using a
feed-forward architecture. Our architecture has two main components, a 4D video
model and a 4D reconstruction model. In the first part, we analyze current 4D
video diffusion architectures that perform spatial and temporal attention
either sequentially or in parallel within a two-stream design. We highlight the
limitations of existing approaches and introduce a novel fused architecture
that performs spatial and temporal attention within a single layer. The key to
our method is a sparse attention pattern, where tokens attend to others in the
same frame, at the same timestamp, or from the same viewpoint. In the second
part, we extend existing 3D reconstruction algorithms by introducing a Gaussian
head, a camera token replacement algorithm, and additional dynamic layers and
training. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for 4D generation,
improving both visual quality and reconstruction capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phantom-Data, a cross-pair dataset to address the copy-paste problem in subject-to-video generation, improving prompt alignment and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle with textual instruction fidelity due to the copy-paste problem caused by in-pair training, which entangles subject identity with background attributes.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) subject detection, (2) cross-context retrieval from large-scale videos/images, and (3) identity verification to ensure consistency.

Result: Training with Phantom-Data enhances prompt alignment and visual quality while maintaining identity consistency.

Conclusion: Phantom-Data effectively mitigates the copy-paste problem, offering a robust solution for subject-to-video generation.

Abstract: Subject-to-video generation has witnessed substantial progress in recent
years. However, existing models still face significant challenges in faithfully
following textual instructions. This limitation, commonly known as the
copy-paste problem, arises from the widely used in-pair training paradigm. This
approach inherently entangles subject identity with background and contextual
attributes by sampling reference images from the same scene as the target
video. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{Phantom-Data, the first
general-purpose cross-pair subject-to-video consistency dataset}, containing
approximately one million identity-consistent pairs across diverse categories.
Our dataset is constructed via a three-stage pipeline: (1) a general and
input-aligned subject detection module, (2) large-scale cross-context subject
retrieval from more than 53 million videos and 3 billion images, and (3)
prior-guided identity verification to ensure visual consistency under
contextual variation. Comprehensive experiments show that training with
Phantom-Data significantly improves prompt alignment and visual quality while
preserving identity consistency on par with in-pair baselines.

object localization for tasks like grasping. We present RAG-6DPose, a
retrieval-augmented approach that leverages 3D CAD models as a knowledge base
by integrating both visual and geometric cues. Our RAG-6DPose roughly contains
three stages: 1) Building a Multi-Modal CAD Knowledge Base by extracting 2D
visual features from multi-view CAD rendered images and also attaching 3D
points; 2) Retrieving relevant CAD features from the knowledge base based on
the current query image via our ReSPC module; and 3) Incorporating retrieved
CAD information to refine pose predictions via retrieval-augmented decoding.

TL;DR: TAMMs enhances MLLMs for satellite image time-series analysis with temporal modules and semantic-fused control, outperforming baselines in change understanding and future image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial-temporal reasoning in satellite image analysis, prompting the need for improved temporal modeling.

Method: TAMMs introduces lightweight temporal modules for sequence encoding and contextual prompting, plus a Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism for future image generation.

Result: TAMMs outperforms MLLM baselines in temporal change understanding and future image forecasting.

Conclusion: Carefully designed temporal reasoning and semantic fusion unlock MLLMs' potential for spatio-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Satellite image time-series analysis demands fine-grained spatial-temporal
reasoning, which remains a challenge for existing multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). In this work, we study the capabilities of MLLMs on a novel
task that jointly targets temporal change understanding and future scene
generation, aiming to assess their potential for modeling complex multimodal
dynamics over time. We propose TAMMs, a Temporal-Aware Multimodal Model for
satellite image change understanding and forecasting, which enhances frozen
MLLMs with lightweight temporal modules for structured sequence encoding and
contextual prompting. To guide future image generation, TAMMs introduces a
Semantic-Fused Control Injection (SFCI) mechanism that adaptively combines
high-level semantic reasoning and structural priors within an enhanced
ControlNet. This dual-path conditioning enables temporally consistent and
semantically grounded image synthesis. Experiments demonstrate that TAMMs
outperforms strong MLLM baselines in both temporal change understanding and
future image forecasting tasks, highlighting how carefully designed temporal
reasoning and semantic fusion can unlock the full potential of MLLMs for
spatio-temporal understanding.

TL;DR: OmniAvatar is an audio-driven full-body video generation model improving lip-sync accuracy and natural movements, outperforming existing methods with precise text-based control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on facial movements, lacking full-body animation and precise prompt control. OmniAvatar addresses these limitations.

Method: Uses pixel-wise multi-hierarchical audio embedding and LoRA-based training to enhance lip-syncing and integrate audio features with prompt control.

Result: Outperforms existing models in facial and semi-body video generation, enabling precise control for diverse domains.

Conclusion: OmniAvatar advances audio-driven human animation with superior synchronization, fluidity, and control.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in audio-driven human animation, while
most existing methods focus mainly on facial movements, limiting their ability
to create full-body animations with natural synchronization and fluidity. They
also struggle with precise prompt control for fine-grained generation. To
tackle these challenges, we introduce OmniAvatar, an innovative audio-driven
full-body video generation model that enhances human animation with improved
lip-sync accuracy and natural movements. OmniAvatar introduces a pixel-wise
multi-hierarchical audio embedding strategy to better capture audio features in
the latent space, enhancing lip-syncing across diverse scenes. To preserve the
capability for prompt-driven control of foundation models while effectively
incorporating audio features, we employ a LoRA-based training approach.
Extensive experiments show that OmniAvatar surpasses existing models in both
facial and semi-body video generation, offering precise text-based control for
creating videos in various domains, such as podcasts, human interactions,
dynamic scenes, and singing. Our project page is

*Xinyu Zhang,Dong Gong,Zicheng Duan,Anton van den Hengel,Lingqiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVAA is a framework for automatically aligning video motion with music beats, preserving original content through keyframe alignment and rhythm-aware inpainting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning video motion with music beats enhances engagement but is labor-intensive or inflexible with current methods.

Method: MVAA uses a two-step process: aligning keyframes with beats and rhythm-aware inpainting with a diffusion model.

Result: Achieves high-quality beat alignment and visual smoothness, adapting quickly (10 minutes) on a single GPU.

Conclusion: MVAA offers an efficient, flexible solution for music-video synchronization, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Aligning the rhythm of visual motion in a video with a given music track is a
practical need in multimedia production, yet remains an underexplored task in
autonomous video editing. Effective alignment between motion and musical beats
enhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,
promotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend
on labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based
editing techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models
handle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two
modalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while
preserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and
efficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that
automatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while
preserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize
the task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with
audio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first
insert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a
frame-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,
preserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time
training can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the
inpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed
by rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation. This hybrid
approach enables adaptation within 10 minutes with one epoch on a single NVIDIA
4090 GPU using CogVideoX-5b-I2V as the backbone. Extensive experiments show
that our approach can achieve high-quality beat alignment and visual
smoothness.

TL;DR: Universal photometric stereo aims to recover surface normals under arbitrary lighting, but faces challenges in decoupling illumination from surface features and preserving high-frequency details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the ambiguity in observed intensity due to varying illumination and the difficulty in capturing high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces.

Method: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, but likely involves advanced techniques to decouple illumination and surface features while preserving geometric details.

Result: Not explicitly mentioned in the abstract, but the goal is high-quality surface normal recovery under arbitrary lighting.

Conclusion: Universal photometric stereo remains challenging due to illumination ambiguity and geometric detail preservation, requiring further advancements.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) aims to recover high-quality surface
normals from objects under arbitrary lighting conditions without relying on
specific illumination models. Despite recent advances such as SDM-UniPS and Uni
MS-PS, two fundamental challenges persist: 1) the deep coupling between varying
illumination and surface normal features, where ambiguity in observed intensity
makes it difficult to determine whether brightness variations stem from
lighting changes or surface orientation; and 2) the preservation of
high-frequency geometric details in complex surfaces, where intricate
geometries create self-shadowing, inter-reflections, and subtle normal
variations that conventional feature processing operations struggle to capture
accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to specific video domains or durations, lacking universality and robustness.

Method: UniTime integrates timestamp tokens with video tokens in MLLMs and uses adaptive frame scaling for diverse video lengths.

Result: UniTime excels in zero-shot and finetuned settings across benchmarks and improves VideoQA accuracy.

Conclusion: UniTime is a robust, universal solution for video temporal grounding and enhances complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a computational model for universal video temporal
grounding, which accurately localizes temporal moments in videos based on
natural language queries (e.g., questions or descriptions). Unlike existing
methods that are often limited to specific video domains or durations, we
propose UniTime, a robust and universal video grounding model leveraging the
strong vision-language understanding capabilities of generative Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our model effectively handles videos of diverse
views, genres, and lengths while comprehending complex language queries. The
key contributions include: (i) We consider steering strong MLLMs for temporal
grounding in videos. To enable precise timestamp outputs, we incorporate
temporal information by interleaving timestamp tokens with video tokens. (ii)
By training the model to handle videos with different input granularities
through adaptive frame scaling, our approach achieves robust temporal grounding
for both short and long videos. (iii) Comprehensive experiments show that
UniTime outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both zero-shot and
dataset-specific finetuned settings across five public temporal grounding
benchmarks. (iv) When employed as a preliminary moment retriever for long-form
video question-answering (VideoQA), UniTime significantly improves VideoQA
accuracy, highlighting its value for complex video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 4D-LRM is a scalable 4D reconstruction model that learns general space-time representations, enabling fast, high-quality rendering from arbitrary views and times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior 4D approaches (e.g., inefficiency, lack of generalization, or faithfulness) by learning a unified space-time representation.

Method: 4D-LRM predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from posed image tokens across time, enabling efficient rendering at infinite frame rates.

Result: The model generalizes to novel objects, interpolates time, handles diverse cameras, and reconstructs 24-frame sequences in <1.5s on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: Scaling spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction, demonstrating the potential of 4D-LRM.

Abstract: Can we scale 4D pretraining to learn general space-time representations that
reconstruct an object from a few views at some times to any view at any time?
We provide an affirmative answer with 4D-LRM, the first large-scale 4D
reconstruction model that takes input from unconstrained views and timestamps
and renders arbitrary novel view-time combinations. Unlike prior 4D approaches,
e.g., optimization-based, geometry-based, or generative, that struggle with
efficiency, generalization, or faithfulness, 4D-LRM learns a unified space-time
representation and directly predicts per-pixel 4D Gaussian primitives from
posed image tokens across time, enabling fast, high-quality rendering at, in
principle, infinite frame rate. Our results demonstrate that scaling
spatiotemporal pretraining enables accurate and efficient 4D reconstruction. We
show that 4D-LRM generalizes to novel objects, interpolates across time, and
handles diverse camera setups. It reconstructs 24-frame sequences in one
forward pass with less than 1.5 seconds on a single A100 GPU.

TL;DR: FilMaster is an AI system for professional film generation, integrating cinematic principles and post-production workflows to improve camera language and cinematic rhythm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI film generation lacks professional quality due to poor implementation of cinematic principles, leading to unengaging content.

Method: FilMaster uses a two-stage process: Reference-Guided Generation and Generative Post-Production, leveraging real-world film data and audience-centric workflows.

Result: FilMaster outperforms in camera language and cinematic rhythm, validated by the FilmEval benchmark.

Conclusion: FilMaster advances AI in professional filmmaking by addressing key limitations in current systems.

Abstract: AI-driven content creation has shown potential in film production. However,
existing film generation systems struggle to implement cinematic principles and
thus fail to generate professional-quality films, particularly lacking diverse
camera language and cinematic rhythm. This results in templated visuals and
unengaging narratives. To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end
AI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for
professional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard
outputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography
from extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,
audience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,
FilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which
transforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage
which transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual
and auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a
Multi-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in
generating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a
vast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates
professional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm
Control module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by
simulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements
to achieve engaging content. The system is empowered by generative AI models
like (M)LLMs and video generation models. Furthermore, we introduce FilmEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI-generated films. Extensive
experiments show FilMaster's superior performance in camera language design and
cinematic rhythm control, advancing generative AI in professional filmmaking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework improves visual consistency in story visualization by iteratively correcting inconsistencies without regenerating entire sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of maintaining visual consistency in multi-panel story visualizations, especially for character and object persistence.

Method: Proposes a collaborative multi-agent framework for autonomous identification, correction, and refinement of inconsistencies, working iteratively with diffusion models.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches in multi-panel consistency, demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: The framework is model-agnostic and effective for enhancing visual consistency in story visualization tasks.

Abstract: Story visualization has become a popular task where visual scenes are
generated to depict a narrative across multiple panels. A central challenge in
this setting is maintaining visual consistency, particularly in how characters
and objects persist and evolve throughout the story. Despite recent advances in
diffusion models, current approaches often fail to preserve key character
attributes, leading to incoherent narratives. In this work, we propose a
collaborative multi-agent framework that autonomously identifies, corrects, and
refines inconsistencies across multi-panel story visualizations. The agents
operate in an iterative loop, enabling fine-grained, panel-level updates
without re-generating entire sequences. Our framework is model-agnostic and
flexibly integrates with a variety of diffusion models, including rectified
flow transformers such as Flux and latent diffusion models such as Stable
Diffusion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method
outperforms prior approaches in terms of multi-panel consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create photorealistic, temporally consistent videos from user inputs, addressing challenges like low-latency feedback and control accuracy.

Method: Uses iterative chunk-wise prediction, trained on labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos without action annotations.

Result: Generalizes control signals and entities beyond training, handling diverse real-world scenarios like bicycles and pedestrians.

Conclusion: RealPlay demonstrates effective generalization and realistic video generation, enabling interactive applications beyond gaming.

Abstract: We introduce RealPlay, a neural network-based real-world game engine that
enables interactive video generation from user control signals. Unlike prior
works focused on game-style visuals, RealPlay aims to produce photorealistic,
temporally consistent video sequences that resemble real-world footage. It
operates in an interactive loop: users observe a generated scene, issue a
control command, and receive a short video chunk in response. To enable such
realistic and responsive generation, we address key challenges including
iterative chunk-wise prediction for low-latency feedback, temporal consistency
across iterations, and accurate control response. RealPlay is trained on a
combination of labeled game data and unlabeled real-world videos, without
requiring real-world action annotations. Notably, we observe two forms of
generalization: (1) control transfer-RealPlay effectively maps control signals
from virtual to real-world scenarios; and (2) entity transfer-although training
labels originate solely from a car racing game, RealPlay generalizes to control
diverse real-world entities, including bicycles and pedestrians, beyond
vehicles. Project page can be found: https://wenqsun.github.io/RealPlay/

TL;DR: A novel memory mechanism, Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), improves video generation by efficiently retrieving relevant past views, ensuring long-term scene coherence and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for interactive video generation either accumulate errors in 3D reconstruction or struggle with long-term scene coherence due to short context windows.

Method: Introduces VMem, which indexes past views geometrically using 3D surface elements (surfels) for efficient retrieval during new view generation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in maintaining scene coherence and camera control on long-term scene synthesis benchmarks.

Conclusion: VMem offers a computationally efficient solution for consistent and coherent video generation in interactive environments.

Abstract: We propose a novel memory mechanism to build video generators that can
explore environments interactively. Similar results have previously been
achieved by out-painting 2D views of the scene while incrementally
reconstructing its 3D geometry, which quickly accumulates errors, or by video
generators with a short context window, which struggle to maintain scene
coherence over the long term. To address these limitations, we introduce
Surfel-Indexed View Memory (VMem), a mechanism that remembers past views by
indexing them geometrically based on the 3D surface elements (surfels) they
have observed. VMem enables the efficient retrieval of the most relevant past
views when generating new ones. By focusing only on these relevant views, our
method produces consistent explorations of imagined environments at a fraction
of the computational cost of using all past views as context. We evaluate our
approach on challenging long-term scene synthesis benchmarks and demonstrate
superior performance compared to existing methods in maintaining scene
coherence and camera control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TC-Light is a two-stage video relighting method optimizing global illumination and fine-grained texture, achieving temporal coherence and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video relighting techniques lack temporal consistency and efficiency, especially for dynamic scenes.

Method: Two-stage post-optimization: first aligns global illumination via appearance embedding, then refines texture and lighting with Unique Video Tensor (UVT).

Result: Produces physically plausible relighting with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

Conclusion: TC-Light advances video relighting for dynamic scenes, offering practical benefits for content creation and AI data scaling.

Abstract: Editing illumination in long videos with complex dynamics has significant
value in various downstream tasks, including visual content creation and
manipulation, as well as data scaling up for embodied AI through sim2real and
real2real transfer. Nevertheless, existing video relighting techniques are
predominantly limited to portrait videos or fall into the bottleneck of
temporal consistency and computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose
TC-Light, a novel paradigm characterized by the proposed two-stage post
optimization mechanism. Starting from the video preliminarily relighted by an
inflated video relighting model, it optimizes appearance embedding in the first
stage to align global illumination. Then it optimizes the proposed canonical
video representation, i.e., Unique Video Tensor (UVT), to align fine-grained
texture and lighting in the second stage. To comprehensively evaluate
performance, we also establish a long and highly dynamic video benchmark.
Extensive experiments show that our method enables physically plausible
relighting results with superior temporal coherence and low computation cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the robustness and generalization of small language models under different adaptation strategies (prompting vs. fine-tuning) in low-resource and OOD scenarios.

Method: Comparative analysis of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and model scales, with evaluation in in-distribution and OOD settings. Internal representations are also analyzed.

Result: Highlights critical differences in how small models generalize knowledge under prompting and fine-tuning, offering insights into stability and abstraction of task-specific features.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes empirical insights to the prompting vs. fine-tuning debate.

Abstract: We investigate the generalization capabilities of small language models under
two popular adaptation paradigms: few-shot prompting and supervised
fine-tuning. While prompting is often favored for its parameter efficiency and
flexibility, it remains unclear how robust this approach is in low-resource
settings and under distributional shifts. This paper presents a comparative
study of prompting and fine-tuning across task formats, prompt styles, and
model scales, with a focus on their behavior in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.
  Beyond accuracy, we analyze the internal representations learned by each
approach to assess the stability and abstraction of task-specific features. Our
findings highlight critical differences in how small models internalize and
generalize knowledge under different adaptation strategies. This work offers
practical guidance for model selection in low-data regimes and contributes

### [177] [Individual Causal Inference with Structural Causal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17300)
*Daniel T. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes Individual Causal Inference (ICI) using Structural Causal Models (SCM) to estimate individualized causal effects (ICE) by leveraging exogenous variables to encode individual variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most causal inference methods are population-based, making it challenging to estimate individual causal effects due to limited individual data. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: The authors introduce the indiv-operator (indiv(W)) and individual causal queries (P(Y | indiv(W), do(X), Z)) to formalize ICI within SCM, treating it as 'rung 3' causal inference.

Result: ICI with SCM is shown to focus on individual alternatives (possible scenarios) rather than counterfactuals (non-actual scenarios).

Conclusion: The paper successfully formalizes ICI within SCM, providing a framework for estimating individualized causal effects by leveraging exogenous variables.

Abstract: Individual causal inference (ICI) uses causal inference methods to understand
and predict the effects of interventions on individuals, considering their
specific characteristics / facts. It aims to estimate individual causal effect
(ICE), which varies across individuals. Estimating ICE can be challenging due
to the limited data available for individuals, and the fact that most causal
inference methods are population-based. Structural Causal Model (SCM) is
fundamentally population-based. Therefore, causal discovery (structural
learning and parameter learning), association queries and intervention queries
are all naturally population-based. However, exogenous variables (U) in SCM can
encode individual variations and thus provide the mechanism for individualized
population per specific individual characteristics / facts. Based on this, we
propose ICI with SCM as a "rung 3" causal inference, because it involves
"imagining" what would be the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention on
an individual, given the individual's observed characteristics / facts.
Specifically, we propose the indiv-operator, indiv(W), to formalize/represent
the population individualization process, and the individual causal query, P(Y
| indiv(W), do(X), Z), to formalize/represent ICI. We show and argue that ICI
with SCM is inference on individual alternatives (possible), not individual
counterfactuals (non-actual).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI alignment via Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC) uses heuristics to approximate stakeholder agreements efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI must navigate human environments with diverse goals; securing stakeholder agreements is costly and slow.

Method: Proposes RRC, a framework using normatively-grounded heuristics to trade effort for accuracy.

Result: RRC enables efficient, adaptable AI decision-making in dynamic human social contexts.

Conclusion: RRC offers a scalable, interpretable approach to AI alignment in complex environments.

Abstract: AI systems will soon have to navigate human environments and make decisions
that affect people and other AI agents whose goals and values diverge.
Contractualist alignment proposes grounding those decisions in agreements that
diverse stakeholders would endorse under the right conditions, yet securing
such agreement at scale remains costly and slow -- even for advanced AI. We
therefore propose Resource-Rational Contractualism (RRC): a framework where AI
systems approximate the agreements rational parties would form by drawing on a
toolbox of normatively-grounded, cognitively-inspired heuristics that trade
effort for accuracy. An RRC-aligned agent would not only operate efficiently,
but also be equipped to dynamically adapt to and interpret the ever-changing
human social world.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper discusses the challenges of AI performance degradation in healthcare due to shifting data and evolving clinical practices, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and self-correction mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems in healthcare face performance degradation over time due to dynamic clinical environments, risking reliability and safety.

Method: The review examines causes of degradation, techniques for drift detection, root cause analysis, and correction strategies like retraining and adaptation.

Result: The paper provides insights into maintaining AI reliability, covering traditional and advanced models like LLMs, and identifies their limitations.

Conclusion: The work aims to guide robust medical AI development for safe, long-term deployment, highlighting ongoing challenges and future research directions.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into modern
healthcare, offering powerful support for clinical decision-making. However, in
real-world settings, AI systems may experience performance degradation over
time, due to factors such as shifting data distributions, changes in patient
characteristics, evolving clinical protocols, and variations in data quality.
These factors can compromise model reliability, posing safety concerns and
increasing the likelihood of inaccurate predictions or adverse outcomes. This
review presents a forward-looking perspective on monitoring and maintaining the
"health" of AI systems in healthcare. We highlight the urgent need for
continuous performance monitoring, early degradation detection, and effective
self-correction mechanisms. The paper begins by reviewing common causes of
performance degradation at both data and model levels. We then summarize key
techniques for detecting data and model drift, followed by an in-depth look at
root cause analysis. Correction strategies are further reviewed, ranging from
model retraining to test-time adaptation. Our survey spans both traditional
machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs),
offering insights into their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss
ongoing technical challenges and propose future research directions. This work
aims to guide the development of reliable, robust medical AI systems capable of
sustaining safe, long-term deployment in dynamic clinical settings.

*Manasa Bharadwaj,Nikhil Verma,Kevin Ferreira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OmniReflect is a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework for LLM agents, enhancing performance via a constitution of guiding principles. It shows significant task success improvements across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent improvements lack generalizable long-term learning and efficiency in dynamic environments. OmniReflect addresses this with a reflection-driven approach.

Method: OmniReflect uses Self-sustaining (agent curates reflections) and Co-operative (Meta-advisor guides agent) modes, employing Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques.

Result: Absolute gains: +10.3% (ALFWorld), +23.8% (BabyAI), +8.3% (PDDL) in Self-sustaining mode. Co-operative mode outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: OmniReflect is robust and effective across environments and backbones, offering adaptable and efficient LLM agent learning.

Abstract: Efforts to improve Large Language Model (LLM) agent performance on complex
tasks have largely focused on fine-tuning and iterative self-correction.
However, these approaches often lack generalizable mechanisms for longterm
learning and remain inefficient in dynamic environments. We introduce
OmniReflect, a hierarchical, reflection-driven framework that constructs a
constitution, a compact set of guiding principles distilled from task
experiences, to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of an LLM agent.
OmniReflect operates in two modes: Self-sustaining, where a single agent
periodically curates its own reflections during task execution, and
Co-operative, where a Meta-advisor derives a constitution from a small
calibration set to guide another agent. To construct these constitutional
principles, we employ Neural, Symbolic, and NeuroSymbolic techniques, offering
a balance between contextual adaptability and computational efficiency.
Empirical results averaged across models show major improvements in task
success, with absolute gains of +10.3% on ALFWorld, +23.8% on BabyAI, and +8.3%
on PDDL in the Self-sustaining mode. Similar gains are seen in the Co-operative
mode, where a lightweight Qwen3-4B ReAct agent outperforms all Reflexion
baselines on BabyAI. These findings highlight the robustness and effectiveness
of OmniReflect across environments and backbones.

*Yao Zhang,Zaixi Shang,Silpan Patel,Mikel Zuniga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel offline-first methodology using LLMs to transform noisy support tickets into a structured knowledge base, improving RAG system performance and operational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Critical knowledge in supply chain operations is buried in unstructured communications like support tickets, which are noisy and inconsistent, limiting RAG system effectiveness.

Method: A multi-agent LLM system with three specialized agents: Category Discovery, Categorization, and Knowledge Synthesis, to create a structured knowledge base from support tickets.

Result: The system reduces ticket data volume to 3.4%, improves RAG performance (48.74% vs. 38.60% helpful answers), and cuts unhelpful responses by 77.4%.

Conclusion: The approach transforms transient communications into reusable knowledge, enhancing operational efficiency and automating 50% of future ticket resolutions.

Abstract: Supply chain operations generate vast amounts of operational data; however,
critical knowledge such as system usage practices, troubleshooting workflows,
and resolution techniques often remains buried within unstructured
communications like support tickets, emails, and chat logs. While RAG systems
aim to leverage such communications as a knowledge base, their effectiveness is
limited by raw data challenges: support tickets are typically noisy,
inconsistent, and incomplete, making direct retrieval suboptimal. Unlike
existing RAG approaches that focus on runtime optimization, we introduce a
novel offline-first methodology that transforms these communications into a
structured knowledge base. Our key innovation is a LLMs-based multi-agent
system orchestrating three specialized agents: Category Discovery for taxonomy
creation, Categorization for ticket grouping, and Knowledge Synthesis for
article generation. Applying our methodology to real-world support tickets with
resolution notes and comments, our system creates a compact knowledge base -
reducing total volume to just 3.4% of original ticket data while improving
quality. Experiments demonstrate that our prebuilt knowledge base in RAG
systems significantly outperforms traditional RAG implementations (48.74% vs.
38.60% helpful answers) and achieves a 77.4% reduction in unhelpful responses.
By automating institutional knowledge capture that typically remains siloed in
experts' heads, our solution translates to substantial operational efficiency:
reducing support workload, accelerating resolution times, and creating
self-improving systems that automatically resolve approximately 50% of future
supply chain tickets. Our approach addresses a key gap in knowledge management
by transforming transient communications into structured, reusable knowledge
through intelligent offline processing rather than latency-inducing runtime
architectures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'kaleidoscopic teaming' to evaluate safety risks in AI agents, addressing gaps in existing frameworks for single- and multi-agent scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety evaluation frameworks fail to assess complex behaviors and multi-agent interactions, necessitating a new approach.

Method: A kaleidoscopic teaming framework generates diverse scenarios for safety evaluation, using in-context optimization and metrics.

Result: The framework identifies vulnerabilities in AI models for agentic use-cases.

Conclusion: Kaleidoscopic teaming provides a comprehensive method to evaluate and improve AI agent safety.

Abstract: Warning: This paper contains content that may be inappropriate or offensive.
  AI agents have gained significant recent attention due to their autonomous
tool usage capabilities and their integration in various real-world
applications. This autonomy poses novel challenges for the safety of such
systems, both in single- and multi-agent scenarios. We argue that existing red
teaming or safety evaluation frameworks fall short in evaluating safety risks
in complex behaviors, thought processes and actions taken by agents. Moreover,
they fail to consider risks in multi-agent setups where various vulnerabilities
can be exposed when agents engage in complex behaviors and interactions with
each other. To address this shortcoming, we introduce the term kaleidoscopic
teaming which seeks to capture complex and wide range of vulnerabilities that
can happen in agents both in single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. We also
present a new kaleidoscopic teaming framework that generates a diverse array of
scenarios modeling real-world human societies. Our framework evaluates safety
of agents in both single-agent and multi-agent setups. In single-agent setup,
an agent is given a scenario that it needs to complete using the tools it has
access to. In multi-agent setup, multiple agents either compete against or
cooperate together to complete a task in the scenario through which we capture
existing safety vulnerabilities in agents. We introduce new in-context
optimization techniques that can be used in our kaleidoscopic teaming framework
to generate better scenarios for safety analysis. Lastly, we present
appropriate metrics that can be used along with our framework to measure safety
of agents. Utilizing our kaleidoscopic teaming framework, we identify
vulnerabilities in various models with respect to their safety in agentic
use-cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores training LLMs to reliably attribute answers to pretraining documents without test-time retrieval, proposing Active Indexing over Passive Indexing for better citation precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs often provide unreliable citations due to hallucination, and external retrievers introduce latency and noise. The goal is to enable trustworthy, verifiable answers without retrieval dependencies.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) continual pretraining to bind facts to document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning for citation behavior. Active Indexing uses synthetic QA pairs for diverse fact restatement and bidirectional generation.

Result: Active Indexing outperforms Passive Indexing, achieving up to 30.2% citation precision gains, with performance scaling with augmented data.

Conclusion: Active Indexing is a promising method for reliable attribution in LLMs, showing consistent improvements and scalability.

Abstract: Trustworthy language models should provide both correct and verifiable
answers. While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to
pretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination. As
a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at
inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and
vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to
reliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)
pretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To
evaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world
corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and
probes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.
Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind
facts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit
citation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an
identifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on
paraphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which
continually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in
diverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and
fact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from
a cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B
and 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing
across all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.
Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale
the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the
original token count.

TL;DR: The paper explores enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks by constructing a multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG) and proposing a multi-agent retriever for autonomous knowledge retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due to limited relevant knowledge, prompting the need for effective knowledge harnessing.

Method: Adopts visual game cognition (Monster Hunter: World) to build MH-MMKG, designs challenging queries, and introduces a multi-agent retriever for autonomous knowledge retrieval.

Result: The approach significantly improves MLLMs' performance in complex knowledge retrieval and reasoning.

Conclusion: The work provides a new perspective on multimodal knowledge-augmented reasoning and a foundation for future research.

Abstract: The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its
potential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal
capabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due
to limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition
as a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a
multimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and
intricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries
based on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge
retrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that
enables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional
training. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances
the performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal
knowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CTFKnow, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' technical knowledge in CTF challenges, and proposes CTFAgent, a framework improving LLMs' problem-solving with RAG and environmental augmentation, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in LLMs' ability to apply technical knowledge effectively in CTF challenges, despite their substantial knowledge base.

Method: Developed CTFKnow (3,992 questions) to measure LLMs' CTF knowledge. Proposed CTFAgent with two-stage RAG and interactive Environmental Augmentation to enhance LLMs' performance.

Result: CTFAgent improved performance by over 80% on two datasets and ranked top 23.6% in picoCTF2024.

Conclusion: CTFAgent demonstrates the potential to advance LLMs' CTF problem-solving by combining knowledge retrieval and environmental interaction.

Abstract: Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education
and training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing
interest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA
has organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated
offense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,
from knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight
the importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately
construct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'
performance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative
measurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it
to solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess
substantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this
knowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback
from the CTF environment.
  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a
novel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent
introduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and
interactive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge
and vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results
show that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%
performance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,
CTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This
reflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our
framework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PhysUniBench is a multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on undergraduate-level physics problems, revealing significant gaps in current models' reasoning abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI models struggle with physics problem-solving due to limitations in evaluation methodologies, necessitating a more rigorous assessment tool.

Method: PhysUniBench includes 3,304 questions across 8 physics sub-disciplines, with visual diagrams, open-ended and multiple-choice formats, and a five-level difficulty rating system.

Result: State-of-the-art models like GPT-4o mini perform poorly (34.2% accuracy), struggling with multi-step problems and diagram interpretation.

Conclusion: PhysUniBench aims to advance AI in science by improving models' physical reasoning and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Physics problem-solving is a challenging domain for large AI models,
requiring integration of conceptual understanding, mathematical reasoning, and
interpretation of physical diagrams. Current evaluation methodologies show
notable limitations in capturing the breadth and complexity of
undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for more rigorous
assessments. To this end, we present PhysUniBench, a large-scale multimodal
benchmark designed to evaluate and improve the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) specifically on undergraduate-level
physics problems. PhysUniBench consists of 3,304 physics questions spanning 8
major sub-disciplines of physics, each accompanied by one visual diagrams. The
benchmark includes both open-ended and multiple-choice questions,
systematically curated and difficulty-rated through an iterative
model-in-the-loop process. The benchmark's construction involved a rigorous
multi-stage process, including multiple roll-outs, expert-level evaluation,
automated filtering of easily solved problems, and a nuanced difficulty grading
system with five levels. Through extensive experiments, we observe that current
state-of-the-art models encounter substantial challenges in physics reasoning.
For example, GPT-4o mini achieves only about 34.2\% accuracy in the proposed
PhysUniBench. These results highlight that current MLLMs struggle with advanced
physics reasoning, especially on multi-step problems and those requiring
precise diagram interpretation. By providing a broad and rigorous assessment
tool, PhysUniBench aims to drive progress in AI for Science, encouraging the
development of models with stronger physical reasoning, problem-solving skills,
and multimodal understanding. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are

*Bohan Tang,Dezhao Luo,Jingxuan Chen,Shaogang Gong,Jianye Hao,Jun Wang,Kun Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASL (Action Semantics Learning) improves App agent performance by focusing on action semantics instead of exact syntax, enhancing robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for App agents rely on syntax learning, causing OOD vulnerability. ASL addresses this by learning action semantics.

Method: ASL uses a SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute semantic rewards, training agents to align actions with ground truth semantics, not exact syntax.

Result: ASL outperforms existing methods in accuracy and generalization on smartphone App operation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ASL provides a robust framework for App agents by prioritizing semantic understanding over syntactic reproduction.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) enables the rise of App agents
that interpret user intent and operate smartphone Apps through actions such as
clicking and scrolling. While prompt-based solutions with closed LLM APIs show
promising ability, they incur heavy compute costs and external API dependency.
Fine-tuning smaller open-source LLMs solves these limitations. However, current
fine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to
reproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to
out-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action
Semantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning
objective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,
inspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for
App agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.
With this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a
semantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the
semantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To
support the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior
robustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax
learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on offline and online smartphone App
operation benchmarks show that ASL significantly improves the accuracy and
generalisation of App agents over existing methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new framework for multi-agent collaboration replaces static/graph-based topologies with a sequential structure, enhancing adaptability and reducing communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on rigid inter-agent topologies, limiting adaptability and flexibility in communication.

Method: Proposes a sequential structure with Next-Agent Prediction (role selection) and Next-Context Selection (information access).

Result: Achieves superior performance and reduces communication overhead in benchmarks.

Conclusion: The sequential framework improves adaptability and efficiency in multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent collaboration
highlights the power of structured communication in enabling collective
intelligence. However, existing methods largely rely on static or graph-based
inter-agent topologies, lacking the potential adaptability and flexibility in
communication. In this work, we propose a new framework that rethinks
multi-agent coordination through a sequential structure rather than a graph
structure, offering a significantly larger topology space for multi-agent
communication. Our method focuses on two key directions: (1) Next-Agent
Prediction, which selects the most suitable agent role at each step, and (2)
Next-Context Selection (NCS), which enables each agent to selectively access
relevant information from any previous step. Together, these components
construct task-adaptive communication pipelines that support both role
flexibility and global information flow. Extensive evaluations across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance while
substantially reducing communication overhead.

TL;DR: A hybrid reasoning framework combining LLMs with structured probabilistic models improves social reasoning in Avalon, outperforming larger models and humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social reasoning in LLMs is challenging, especially in games like Avalon, where current models struggle with efficiency and performance when scaled down.

Method: A hybrid framework externalizes belief inference to a probabilistic model while using an LLM for language tasks, tested in Avalon.

Result: Achieves 67% win rate against humans, outperforming baselines and human teammates, with higher qualitative ratings.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach is effective for social reasoning, offering a scalable solution for LLM agents.

Abstract: Social reasoning - inferring unobservable beliefs and intentions from partial
observations of other agents - remains a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs). We evaluate the limits of current reasoning language models in
the social deduction game Avalon and find that while the largest models
demonstrate strong performance, they require extensive test-time inference and
degrade sharply when distilled to smaller, real-time-capable variants. To
address this, we introduce a hybrid reasoning framework that externalizes
belief inference to a structured probabilistic model, while using an LLM for
language understanding and interaction. Our approach achieves competitive
performance with much larger models in Agent-Agent play and, notably, is the
first language agent to defeat human players in a controlled study - achieving
a 67% win rate and receiving higher qualitative ratings than both reasoning
baselines and human teammates. We release code, models, and a dataset to
support future work on social reasoning in LLM agents, which can be found at

TL;DR: The paper introduces an iterative refinement approach to accelerate policy synthesis in large MDPs, outperforming PRISM by up to 2x in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional policy synthesis methods struggle with scalability in large state spaces of MDPs, limiting their practical application.

Method: The approach dynamically refines the MDP, iteratively selecting fragile regions for refinement to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows significant performance improvements (up to 2x) over PRISM in MDPs with up to 1M states.

Conclusion: The method provides a competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis in large MDPs, addressing scalability challenges.

Abstract: Software-intensive systems, such as software product lines and robotics,
utilise Markov decision processes (MDPs) to capture uncertainty and analyse
sequential decision-making problems. Despite the usefulness of conventional
policy synthesis methods, they fail to scale to large state spaces. Our
approach addresses this issue and accelerates policy synthesis in large MDPs by
dynamically refining the MDP and iteratively selecting the most fragile MDP
regions for refinement. This iterative procedure offers a balance between
accuracy and efficiency, as refinement occurs only when necessary. Through a
comprehensive empirical evaluation comprising diverse case studies and MDPs up
to 1M states, we demonstrate significant performance improvements yielded by
our approach compared to the leading probabilistic model checker PRISM (up to
2x), thus offering a very competitive solution for real-world policy synthesis
tasks in larger MDPs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel reward modeling approach to address the diversity of human values in AI alignment, using reflective dialogues to create individualized reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human values are diverse and conflicting; aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks suppressing minority preferences.

Method: Uses a language model to guide users through reflective dialogues, constructing individualized reward models from personalized dialogue history.

Result: Achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal reward models and was more sample efficient than traditional supervised learning.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the heterogeneity of human values, improving alignment accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: AI agents are commonly aligned with "human values" through reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), where a single reward model is learned
from aggregated human feedback and used to align an agent's behavior. However,
human values are not homogeneous--different people hold distinct and sometimes
conflicting values. Aggregating feedback into a single reward model risks
disproportionately suppressing minority preferences. To address this, we
present a novel reward modeling approach for learning individualized reward
models. Our approach uses a language model to guide users through reflective
dialogues where they critique agent behavior and construct their preferences.
This personalized dialogue history, containing the user's reflections and
critiqued examples, is then used as context for another language model that
serves as an individualized reward function (what we call a "verbal reward
model") for evaluating new trajectories. In studies with 30 participants, our
method achieved a 9-12% improvement in accuracy over non-reflective verbal
reward models while being more sample efficient than traditional supervised
learning methods.

TL;DR: The paper advocates for using formal optimal control theory in AI alignment research, proposing a hierarchical 'Alignment Control Stack' to improve interoperability and understanding of control mechanisms across AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI safety and interpretability methods lack generalization and interoperability, limiting their effectiveness for controlling advanced AI systems.

Method: Introduces an 'Alignment Control Stack' that hierarchically organizes alignment and control protocols from physical to socio-technical layers, emphasizing formal interoperability.

Result: The framework aims to bridge optimal control theory with practical AI deployment, enhancing safety and reliability for advanced AI systems.

Conclusion: Adopting formal optimal control principles can provide a more comprehensive alignment framework, aiding regulators and ensuring sustainable AI benefits.

Abstract: This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be
central to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from
prevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety
and mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,
they often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for
other technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render
different alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting
alignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in
terms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according
to which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the
potential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI
systems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a
hierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control
characteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally
interoperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that
will be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies
sustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge
the well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with
practical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment
framework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI
systems.

### [193] [Towards Robust Fact-Checking: A Multi-Agent System with Advanced Evidence Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17878)
*Tam Trinh,Manh Nguyen,Truong-Son Hy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent system for automated fact-checking improves accuracy, efficiency, and transparency, outperforming baselines by 12.3% in Macro F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional and existing automated fact-checking methods in handling complex claims, source credibility, and transparency.

Method: A novel multi-agent system with four specialized agents: Input Ingestion, Query Generation, Evidence Retrieval, and Verdict Prediction.

Result: 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact).

Conclusion: The system enhances automated fact-checking by aligning with human practices while ensuring scalability and transparency.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation in the digital era poses significant
challenges to public discourse, necessitating robust and scalable fact-checking
solutions. Traditional human-led fact-checking methods, while credible,
struggle with the volume and velocity of online content, prompting the
integration of automated systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, existing automated approaches often face limitations, such as handling
complex claims, ensuring source credibility, and maintaining transparency. This
paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for automated fact-checking that
enhances accuracy, efficiency, and explainability. The system comprises four
specialized agents: an Input Ingestion Agent for claim decomposition, a Query
Generation Agent for formulating targeted subqueries, an Evidence Retrieval
Agent for sourcing credible evidence, and a Verdict Prediction Agent for
synthesizing veracity judgments with human-interpretable explanations.
Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FEVEROUS, HOVER, SciFact), the proposed system
achieves a 12.3% improvement in Macro F1-score over baseline methods. The
system effectively decomposes complex claims, retrieves reliable evidence from
trusted sources, and generates transparent explanations for verification
decisions. Our approach contributes to the growing field of automated
fact-checking by providing a more accurate, efficient, and transparent
verification methodology that aligns with human fact-checking practices while
maintaining scalability for real-world applications. Our source code is

### [194] [Leveraging Large Language Model for Intelligent Log Processing and Autonomous Debugging in Cloud AI Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17900)
*Cheng Ji,Huaiying Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM-ID, an intelligent log processing and debugging framework using LLMs, improving fault location accuracy by 16.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in fault location and self-repair due to massive, unstructured, and ambiguous log data in AI cloud systems.

Method: Extends pre-trained Transformer models with multi-stage semantic inference, unsupervised clustering, and reinforcement learning for adaptive debugging.

Result: LLM-ID outperforms existing methods, achieving a 16.2% improvement in fault location accuracy.

Conclusion: LLM-ID enhances semantic understanding, continuous learning, and adaptability in log analysis for cloud systems.

Abstract: With the increasing complexity and rapid expansion of the scale of AI systems
in cloud platforms, the log data generated during system operation is massive,
unstructured, and semantically ambiguous, which brings great challenges to
fault location and system self-repair. In order to solve this problem, this
paper proposes an intelligent log processing and automatic debugging framework
based on Large Language Model (LLM), named Intelligent Debugger (LLM-ID). This
method is extended on the basis of the existing pre-trained Transformer model,
and integrates a multi-stage semantic inference mechanism to realize the
context understanding of system logs and the automatic reconstruction of fault
chains. Firstly, the system log is dynamically structured, and the unsupervised
clustering and embedding mechanism is used to extract the event template and
semantic schema. Subsequently, the fine-tuned LLM combined with the multi-round
attention mechanism to perform contextual reasoning on the log sequence to
generate potential fault assumptions and root cause paths. Furthermore, this
paper introduces a reinforcement learning-based policy-guided recovery planner,
which is driven by the remediation strategy generated by LLM to support dynamic
decision-making and adaptive debugging in the cloud environment. Compared with
the existing rule engine or traditional log analysis system, the proposed model
has stronger semantic understanding ability, continuous learning ability and
heterogeneous environment adaptability. Experiments on the cloud platform log
dataset show that LLM-ID improves the fault location accuracy by 16.2%, which
is significantly better than the current mainstream methods

*Jinjie Wei,Jiyao Liu,Lihao Liu,Ming Hu,Junzhi Ning,Mingcheng Li,Weijie Yin,Junjun He,Xiao Liang,Chao Feng,Dingkang Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CogniGUI introduces a cognitive framework for GUI automation, combining an omni parser engine and GRPO agent to enable adaptive learning, outperforming existing methods on new and traditional benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents rely on trial-and-error and simplistic metrics, lacking adaptive learning and realistic evaluation.

Method: Uses a dual-system approach: an omni parser for quick GUI element parsing and a GRPO agent for efficient interaction path assessment.

Result: CogniGUI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in benchmarks, including the new ScreenSeek benchmark.

Conclusion: The framework advances GUI automation by enabling adaptive learning and realistic evaluation, addressing current limitations.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have made significant progress in
automating digital tasks through the utilization of computer vision and
language models. Nevertheless, existing agent systems encounter notable
limitations. Firstly, they predominantly depend on trial and error decision
making rather than progressive reasoning, thereby lacking the capability to
learn and adapt from interactive encounters. Secondly, these systems are
assessed using overly simplistic single step accuracy metrics, which do not
adequately reflect the intricate nature of real world GUI interactions. In this
paper, we present CogniGUI, a cognitive framework developed to overcome these
limitations by enabling adaptive learning for GUI automation resembling
human-like behavior. Inspired by Kahneman's Dual Process Theory, our approach
combines two main components: (1) an omni parser engine that conducts immediate
hierarchical parsing of GUI elements through quick visual semantic analysis to
identify actionable components, and (2) a Group based Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) grounding agent that assesses multiple interaction paths
using a unique relative reward system, promoting minimal and efficient
operational routes. This dual-system design facilitates iterative ''exploration
learning mastery'' cycles, enabling the agent to enhance its strategies over
time based on accumulated experience. Moreover, to assess the generalization
and adaptability of agent systems, we introduce ScreenSeek, a comprehensive
benchmark that includes multi application navigation, dynamic state
transitions, and cross interface coherence, which are often overlooked
challenges in current benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that
CogniGUI surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both the current GUI grounding
benchmarks and our newly proposed benchmark.

*Jianyu Wang,Zhiqiang Hu,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel prompt design paradigm, PromptQuine, uses evolutionary search to prune random demonstrations into 'gibberish,' outperforming conventional methods and automatic prompt optimization techniques across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge conventional LLM prompting wisdom by exploring unconventional pruning strategies to improve performance.

Method: Propose PromptQuine, a self-discover framework using evolutionary search to find effective pruning strategies with minimal data.

Result: 'Gibberish' prompts match or surpass state-of-the-art methods, achieving gains across tasks like classification, QA, and math reasoning.

Conclusion: The findings encourage mechanistic studies on in-context learning and open-ended search algorithms for better LLM prompting.

Abstract: We propose a novel prompt design paradigm that challenges conventional wisdom
in large language model (LLM) prompting. While conventional wisdom prioritizes
well-crafted instructions and demonstrations for in-context learning (ICL), we
show that pruning random demonstrations into seemingly incoherent "gibberish"
can remarkably improve performance across diverse tasks. Notably, the
"gibberish" always matches or surpasses state-of-the-art automatic prompt
optimization techniques, achieving substantial gains regardless of LLM
alignment. Nevertheless, discovering an effective pruning strategy is
non-trivial, as existing attribution methods and prompt compression algorithms
fail to deliver robust results, let alone human intuition. In terms of this, we
propose a self-discover prompt optimization framework, PromptQuine, an
evolutionary search framework that automatically searches for the pruning
strategy by itself using only low-data regimes. Much like the emergent
complexity in nature--such as symbiosis and self-organization--arising in
response to resource constraints, our framework evolves and refines
unconventional yet highly effective prompts by leveraging only the tokens
present within the context. We demonstrate its effectiveness across
classification, multi-choice question answering, generation and math reasoning
tasks across LLMs, while achieving decent runtime efficiency. We hope our
findings can guide mechanistic studies on in-context learning, and provide a
call to action, to pave the way for more open-ended search algorithms for more
effective LLM prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph integrating data from BNF, DrugBank, and MMA to support clinical and regulatory decisions, addressing fragmented drug information sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evolving role of pharmacists requires accurate, integrated medicinal data, which current fragmented sources lack.

Method: medicX-KG integrates data from BNF, DrugBank, and MMA, using AI and semantic technologies to create a unified knowledge graph.

Result: The KG effectively supports queries on drug availability, interactions, adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes.

Conclusion: medicX-KG addresses fragmented data but has limitations like missing dosage details; future enhancements are planned.

Abstract: The role of pharmacists is evolving from medicine dispensing to delivering
comprehensive pharmaceutical services within multidisciplinary healthcare
teams. Central to this shift is access to accurate, up-to-date medicinal
product information supported by robust data integration. Leveraging artificial
intelligence and semantic technologies, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) uncover hidden
relationships and enable data-driven decision-making. This paper presents
medicX-KG, a pharmacist-oriented knowledge graph supporting clinical and
regulatory decisions. It forms the semantic layer of the broader medicX
platform, powering predictive and explainable pharmacy services. medicX-KG
integrates data from three sources, including, the British National Formulary
(BNF), DrugBank, and the Malta Medicines Authority (MMA) that addresses Malta's
regulatory landscape and combines European Medicines Agency alignment with
partial UK supply dependence. The KG tackles the absence of a unified national
drug repository, reducing pharmacists' reliance on fragmented sources. Its
design was informed by interviews with practicing pharmacists to ensure
real-world applicability. We detail the KG's construction, including data
extraction, ontology design, and semantic mapping. Evaluation demonstrates that
medicX-KG effectively supports queries about drug availability, interactions,
adverse reactions, and therapeutic classes. Limitations, including missing
detailed dosage encoding and real-time updates, are discussed alongside
directions for future enhancements.

TL;DR: The paper reviews how graphs can enhance AI agents by structuring complex data, integrating graph techniques with agent functionalities, and identifying future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents need better planning, memory, and coordination for complex tasks, which can be supported by structured data like graphs.

Method: The survey systematically reviews graph techniques for AI agents, exploring integration with core functionalities and applications.

Result: Graphs offer a powerful paradigm for structuring data to improve AI agent capabilities, with notable applications and future research potential.

Conclusion: Graphs can empower next-generation AI agents to tackle sophisticated challenges, inspiring further development in this area.

Abstract: AI agents have experienced a paradigm shift, from early dominance by
reinforcement learning (RL) to the rise of agents powered by large language
models (LLMs), and now further advancing towards a synergistic fusion of RL and
LLM capabilities. This progression has endowed AI agents with increasingly
strong abilities. Despite these advances, to accomplish complex real-world
tasks, agents are required to plan and execute effectively, maintain reliable
memory, and coordinate smoothly with other agents. Achieving these capabilities
involves contending with ever-present intricate information, operations, and
interactions. In light of this challenge, data structurization can play a
promising role by transforming intricate and disorganized data into
well-structured forms that agents can more effectively understand and process.
In this context, graphs, with their natural advantage in organizing, managing,
and harnessing intricate data relationships, present a powerful data paradigm
for structurization to support the capabilities demanded by advanced AI agents.
To this end, this survey presents a first systematic review of how graphs can
empower AI agents. Specifically, we explore the integration of graph techniques
with core agent functionalities, highlight notable applications, and identify
prospective avenues for future research. By comprehensively surveying this
burgeoning intersection, we hope to inspire the development of next-generation
AI agents equipped to tackle increasingly sophisticated challenges with graphs.

### [199] [Action Language BC+](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18044)
*Joseph Babb,Joohyung Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BC+ is a new action language bridging the gap between traditional action languages and modern ASP, leveraging stable model semantics to incorporate advanced ASP constructs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to modernize action languages by aligning them with the expressive power of contemporary ASP, which includes features like choice rules and aggregates.

Method: The method involves defining BC+ semantics using general stable model semantics for propositional formulas, allowing modern ASP constructs to be represented as shorthands.

Result: BC+ successfully encompasses features of other action languages (B, C, C+, BC) and is computationally feasible using ASP solvers.

Conclusion: BC+ effectively integrates modern ASP capabilities into action languages, enabling broader applicability and implementation via existing ASP tools like cplus2asp.

Abstract: Action languages are formal models of parts of natural language that are
designed to describe effects of actions. Many of these languages can be viewed
as high level notations of answer set programs structured to represent
transition systems. However, the form of answer set programs considered in the
earlier work is quite limited in comparison with the modern Answer Set
Programming (ASP) language, which allows several useful constructs for
knowledge representation, such as choice rules, aggregates, and abstract
constraint atoms. We propose a new action language called BC+, which closes the
gap between action languages and the modern ASP language. The main idea is to
define the semantics of BC+ in terms of general stable model semantics for
propositional formulas, under which many modern ASP language constructs can be
identified with shorthands for propositional formulas. Language BC+ turns out
to be sufficiently expressive to encompass the best features of other action
languages, such as languages B, C, C+, and BC. Computational methods available
in ASP solvers are readily applicable to compute BC+, which led to an
implementation of the language by extending system cplus2asp.

Abstract: We augment Assumption Based Argumentation (ABA for short) with weighted
argumentation. In a nutshell, we assign weights to arguments and then derive

Result: A taxonomy for DR agent workflows and architectures, critical evaluation of benchmarks, and identification of open challenges.

Conclusion: Outlines future research directions and provides a repository for ongoing DR agent research.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a new
category of autonomous AI systems, referred to as Deep Research (DR) agents.
These agents are designed to tackle complex, multi-turn informational research
tasks by leveraging a combination of dynamic reasoning, adaptive long-horizon
planning, multi-hop information retrieval, iterative tool use, and the
generation of structured analytical reports. In this paper, we conduct a
detailed analysis of the foundational technologies and architectural components
that constitute Deep Research agents. We begin by reviewing information
acquisition strategies, contrasting API-based retrieval methods with
browser-based exploration. We then examine modular tool-use frameworks,
including code execution, multimodal input processing, and the integration of
Model Context Protocols (MCPs) to support extensibility and ecosystem
development. To systematize existing approaches, we propose a taxonomy that
differentiates between static and dynamic workflows, and we classify agent
architectures based on planning strategies and agent composition, including
single-agent and multi-agent configurations. We also provide a critical
evaluation of current benchmarks, highlighting key limitations such as
restricted access to external knowledge, sequential execution inefficiencies,
and misalignment between evaluation metrics and the practical objectives of DR
agents. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising directions for future
research. A curated and continuously updated repository of DR agent research is

*Xiang Yuming,Li Sizhao,Li Rongpeng,Zhao Zhifeng,Zhang Honggang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-level reinforcement learning framework (CI-HRL) for UAV swarms to handle cooperative evasion and formation coverage tasks under communication constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high-dimensional challenges in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG) for UAV swarms, especially under communication-limited conditions.

Method: A hierarchical approach: high-level policy (ConsMAC) for target localization and consensus, and low-level policy (AT-M) for obstacle avoidance and formation control.

Result: CI-HRL outperforms in simulations, enhancing swarm collaboration and task completion.

Conclusion: The CI-HRL framework effectively tackles complex UAV swarm tasks in MC-PEG scenarios.

Abstract: Multiple quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have garnered
widespread research interest and fostered tremendous interesting applications,
especially in multi-constrained pursuit-evasion games (MC-PEG). The Cooperative
Evasion and Formation Coverage (CEFC) task, where the UAV swarm aims to
maximize formation coverage across multiple target zones while collaboratively
evading predators, belongs to one of the most challenging issues in MC-PEG,
especially under communication-limited constraints. This multifaceted problem,
which intertwines responses to obstacles, adversaries, target zones, and
formation dynamics, brings up significant high-dimensional complications in
locating a solution. In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework
(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),
which delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a
low-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.
Specifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication
(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish
consensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.
Meanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal
policy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level
control. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity
software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a
superior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task
completion capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper explores model merging's mechanisms, identifying two key capabilities for multi-task abilities, and introduces SE-Merging, a dynamic framework that enhances task-specific expertise without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the underlying mechanisms of model merging, which empirically succeeds but lacks theoretical clarity.

Method: Analyzes model merging from a representation perspective, identifying two key capabilities, and proposes SE-Merging, a dynamic framework leveraging these insights.

Result: SE-Merging improves performance significantly while remaining compatible with existing techniques, without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: Model merging's multi-task abilities stem from task distinction and expert adaptation, and SE-Merging effectively enhances these capabilities dynamically.

Abstract: Model merging has gained increasing attention due to its intriguing property:
interpolating the parameters of different task-specific fine-tuned models leads
to multi-task abilities. However, despite its empirical success, the underlying
mechanisms of model merging remain poorly understood. In this work, we delve
into the mechanism behind model merging from a representation perspective. Our
analysis reveals that model merging achieves multi-task abilities through two
key capabilities: i) distinguishing samples from different tasks, and ii)
adapting to the corresponding expert model for each sample. These two
capabilities allow the merged model to retain task-specific expertise, enabling
efficient multi-task adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose
\texttt{SE-Merging}, a self-enhanced model merging framework that leverages
these two characteristics to dynamically identify the corresponding task for
each sample and then adaptively rescales the merging coefficients to further
enhance task-specific expertise in the merged model. Notably,
\texttt{SE-Merging} achieves dynamic model merging without additional training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SE-Merging} achieves significant
performance improvements while remaining compatible with existing model merging
techniques.

TL;DR: CoachGPT is an AI-based writing assistant leveraging LLMs to provide personalized, educator-guided feedback for academic writing, addressing limitations of traditional and ML-based tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Academic writing is challenging, especially for non-native speakers, and existing tools lack contextual understanding or teaching capabilities.

Method: CoachGPT uses LLMs to convert educator instructions into sub-tasks, offering real-time feedback and scaffolding for writing.

Result: User studies confirm CoachGPT's effectiveness, providing immersive, personalized guidance for academic writing.

Conclusion: CoachGPT demonstrates the potential of LLMs in education by combining AI assistance with structured teaching methods.

Abstract: Academic writing skills are crucial for students' success, but can feel
overwhelming without proper guidance and practice, particularly when writing in
a second language. Traditionally, students ask instructors or search
dictionaries, which are not universally accessible. Early writing assistants
emerged as rule-based systems that focused on detecting misspellings,
subject-verb disagreements, and basic punctuation errors; however, they are
inaccurate and lack contextual understanding. Machine learning-based assistants
demonstrate a strong ability for language understanding but are expensive to
train. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
generating responses in natural languages based on given prompts. Still, they
have a fundamental limitation in education: they generate essays without
teaching, which can have detrimental effects on learning when misused. To
address this limitation, we develop CoachGPT, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to assist individuals with limited educational resources and
those who prefer self-paced learning in academic writing. CoachGPT is an AI
agent-based web application that (1) takes instructions from experienced
educators, (2) converts instructions into sub-tasks, and (3) provides real-time
feedback and suggestions using large language models. This unique scaffolding
structure makes CoachGPT unique among existing writing assistants. Compared to
existing writing assistants, CoachGPT provides a more immersive writing
experience with personalized feedback and guidance. Our user studies prove the
usefulness of CoachGPT and the potential of large language models for academic
writing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs mimic human cognitive tendencies under psychological frameworks like TAT, Framing Bias, MFT, and Cognitive Dissonance.

Method: Evaluated proprietary and open-source models using structured prompts and automated scoring.

Result: Models produced coherent narratives, showed framing bias, aligned with Liberty/Oppression moral concerns, and displayed tempered self-contradictions.

Conclusion: LLMs mirror human cognition but are shaped by training data. Implications for AI transparency, ethics, and bridging psychology with AI safety are discussed.

Abstract: We investigate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit human-like
cognitive patterns under four established frameworks from psychology: Thematic
Apperception Test (TAT), Framing Bias, Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), and
Cognitive Dissonance. We evaluated several proprietary and open-source models
using structured prompts and automated scoring. Our findings reveal that these
models often produce coherent narratives, show susceptibility to positive
framing, exhibit moral judgments aligned with Liberty/Oppression concerns, and
demonstrate self-contradictions tempered by extensive rationalization. Such
behaviors mirror human cognitive tendencies yet are shaped by their training
data and alignment methods. We discuss the implications for AI transparency,
ethical deployment, and future work that bridges cognitive psychology and AI
safety

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a method to explicitly model short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents, improving task state understanding and performance in cross-app tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents struggle with accurately representing task states due to reliance on implicit historical data, lacking mechanisms for storing critical information in complex tasks.

Method: CoM captures action descriptions, integrates screen information, and maintains a memory module to store and manage task-relevant data.

Result: CoM significantly enhances GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks and enables smaller models (7B) to match memory management capabilities of larger models (72B).

Conclusion: The proposed CoM approach and GUI Odyssey-CoM dataset advance GUI agent capabilities, with plans to open-source the dataset and code.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are attracting growing attention in
the development of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents. Existing approaches
often rely on historical screenshots or actions to implicitly represent the
task state. This reliance poses challenges for GUI agents in accurately
understanding task states and underscores the absence of effective mechanisms
to store critical information in complex and lengthy cross-app tasks. To
address these challenges, we propose Chain-of-Memory (CoM), a novel approach
for explicitly modeling short-term and long-term memory in GUI agents. CoM
achieves this by capturing action descriptions, integrating task-relevant
screen information, and maintaining a dedicated memory module to store and
manage this information. By leveraging explicit memory representations, CoM
enables GUI agents to better understand task states and retain critical
historical information persistently. To equip GUI agents with memory management
capabilities and evaluate the effectiveness of CoM, we developed the GUI
Odyssey-CoM, a dataset comprising 111k screen-action pairs annotated with
Chain-of-Memory. Experimental results demonstrate that CoM significantly
improves GUI agents' performance in cross-application tasks. Additionally, GUI
Odyssey-CoM enables 7B models to achieve memory management capabilities
comparable to 72B models. The dataset and code will be open-sourced.

*Zhiting Mei,Christina Zhang,Tenny Yin,Justin Lidard,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores uncertainty quantification (UQ) in reasoning models, addressing their calibration, the impact of deeper reasoning, and the potential of introspective UQ to improve calibration. Findings show models are often overconfident, deeper reasoning worsens calibration, and introspection helps inconsistently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe deployment of reasoning models by understanding and improving their calibration, as they often generate incorrect but confident responses (hallucinations).

Method: Introduces introspective UQ to evaluate reasoning models' calibration, testing if deeper reasoning or introspection improves it. Evaluates SOTA models across benchmarks.

Result: Models are overconfident (especially for incorrect answers), deeper reasoning increases overconfidence, and introspection improves calibration inconsistently (e.g., helps o3-Mini but harms Claude 3.7 Sonnet).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better UQ benchmarks and methods to improve reasoning models' calibration for reliable real-world use.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many
challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using
reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning
models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are
incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is
critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications.
To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this
work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning
models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model
calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their
thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence,
we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning
about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty
quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA
reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning
models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence
estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii)
become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become
better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not
uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we
conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks
and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

### [208] [The Impact of Medication Non-adherence on Adverse Outcomes: Evidence from Schizophrenia Patients via Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18187)
*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Pim Welle,Jeremy C. Weiss,George H. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The study links antipsychotic medication non-adherence in schizophrenia patients to earlier adverse outcomes (death, hospitalization, jail), using survival analysis and causal inference methods. Non-adherence accelerates adverse events by 1-4 months.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of medication non-adherence on adverse outcomes in schizophrenia patients and provide policy-relevant insights.

Method: Survival analysis with causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner, nearest neighbor matching) using longitudinal data (3-12 months).

Result: Non-adherence advances adverse outcomes by 1-4 months, confirmed by subgroup and ablation studies.

Conclusion: Medication adherence is crucial for delaying psychiatric crises; survival analysis combined with causal inference offers valuable policy insights, though causal claims require caution.

Abstract: This study quantifies the association between non-adherence to antipsychotic
medications and adverse outcomes in individuals with schizophrenia. We frame
the problem using survival analysis, focusing on the time to the earliest of
several adverse events (early death, involuntary hospitalization, jail
booking). We extend standard causal inference methods (T-learner, S-learner,
nearest neighbor matching) to utilize various survival models to estimate
individual and average treatment effects, where treatment corresponds to
medication non-adherence. Analyses are repeated using different amounts of
longitudinal information (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Using data from Allegheny
County in western Pennsylvania, we find strong evidence that non-adherence
advances adverse outcomes by approximately 1 to 4 months. Ablation studies
confirm that county-provided risk scores adjust for key confounders, as their
removal amplifies the estimated effects. Subgroup analyses by medication
formulation (injectable vs. oral) and medication type consistently show that
non-adherence is associated with earlier adverse events. These findings
highlight the clinical importance of adherence in delaying psychiatric crises
and show that integrating survival analysis with causal inference tools can
yield policy-relevant insights. We caution that although we apply causal
inference, we only make associative claims and discuss assumptions needed for
causal interpretation.

TL;DR: A framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations to improve transparency, comparability, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of clarity in comprehensively and reliably assessing AI system capabilities and risks.

Method: Proposes a conceptual framework for analyzing AI evaluations, focusing on systematizing methods and terminology without rigid formats.

Result: Enhances transparency, comparability, and interpretability; aids in identifying weaknesses and designing better evaluations.

Conclusion: The framework supports researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in navigating and improving AI evaluation landscapes.

Abstract: As AI systems advance and integrate into society, well-designed and
transparent evaluations are becoming essential tools in AI governance,
informing decisions by providing evidence about system capabilities and risks.
Yet there remains a lack of clarity on how to perform these assessments both
comprehensively and reliably. To address this gap, we propose a conceptual
framework for analyzing AI capability evaluations, offering a structured,
descriptive approach that systematizes the analysis of widely used methods and
terminology without imposing new taxonomies or rigid formats. This framework
supports transparency, comparability, and interpretability across diverse
evaluations. It also enables researchers to identify methodological weaknesses,
assists practitioners in designing evaluations, and provides policymakers with
an accessible tool to scrutinize, compare, and navigate complex evaluation
landscapes.

*Ruike Zhu,Hanwen Zhang,Tianyu Shi,Chi Wang,Tianyi Zhou,Zengyi Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores virtual logical depth (VLD) as a fourth dimension for scaling large language models, showing it improves reasoning without increasing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the potential of parameter reuse (VLD) in scaling models, as its impact on knowledge and reasoning remains understudied.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments to analyze VLD scaling's effects on knowledge capacity and reasoning capability.

Result: VLD scaling keeps knowledge capacity stable while significantly boosting reasoning, without needing more parameters.

Conclusion: VLD is a viable scaling dimension, enhancing reasoning independently of parameter count, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Scaling the size of large language models typically involves three
dimensions: depth, width, and the number of parameters. In this work, we
explore a fourth dimension, virtual logical depth (VLD), which increases the
effective algorithmic depth without changing the overall parameter count by
reusing parameters within the model. Although parameter reuse is not a new
concept, its potential and characteristics in model scaling have not been
thoroughly studied. Through carefully designed controlled experiments, we make
the following key discoveries regarding VLD scaling:
  VLD scaling forces the knowledge capacity of the model to remain almost
constant, with only minor variations.
  VLD scaling enables a significant improvement in reasoning capability,
provided the scaling method is properly implemented.
  The number of parameters correlates with knowledge capacity, but not with
reasoning capability. Under certain conditions, it is not necessary to increase
the parameter count to enhance reasoning.
  These findings are consistent across various model configurations and are
likely to be generally valid within the scope of our experiments.

TL;DR: IDVSCI is a multi-agent LLM framework with dynamic knowledge exchange and dual-diversity review, outperforming existing systems in scientific discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based scientist agents lack interactive reasoning and evaluation, limiting their real-world research applicability.

Method: Proposes IDVSCI with Dynamic Knowledge Exchange and Dual-Diversity Review to enhance reasoning and creativity.

Result: IDVSCI outperforms AI Scientist and VIRSCI on computer science and health sciences datasets.

Conclusion: Modeling interaction and peer review in LLM-based research improves scientific discovery outcomes.

Abstract: Scientific progress increasingly relies on effective collaboration among
researchers, a dynamic that large language models (LLMs) have only begun to
emulate. While recent LLM-based scientist agents show promise in autonomous
scientific discovery, they often lack the interactive reasoning and evaluation
mechanisms essential to real-world research. We propose IDVSCI (Internal
Discussion and Vote SCIentists), a multi-agent framework built on LLMs that
incorporates two key innovations: a Dynamic Knowledge Exchange mechanism
enabling iterative feedback among agents, and a Dual-Diversity Review paradigm
that simulates heterogeneous expert evaluation. These components jointly
promote deeper reasoning and the generation of more creative and impactful
scientific ideas. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach, we conduct experiments on two datasets: a widely used benchmark in
computer science and a new dataset we introduce in the health sciences domain.
Results show that IDVSCI consistently achieves the best performance across both
datasets, outperforming existing systems such as AI Scientist and VIRSCI. These
findings highlight the value of modeling interaction and peer review dynamics
in LLM-based autonomous research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework is proposed to extract sizing relationships from papers, improving analog circuit optimization efficiency by 2.32-26.6x.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore prior knowledge and fail to prune the search space effectively, leaving optimization potential untapped.

Method: A large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework extracts sizing relationships from academic papers to prune the search space.

Result: Tests on 3 circuit types showed optimization efficiency improvements of 2.32-26.6x.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively prune search spaces in analog circuit sizing, offering a novel integration with traditional design automation.

Abstract: In the design process of the analog circuit pre-layout phase, device sizing
is an important step in determining whether an analog circuit can meet the
required performance metrics. Many existing techniques extract the circuit
sizing task as a mathematical optimization problem to solve and continuously
improve the optimization efficiency from a mathematical perspective. But they
ignore the automatic introduction of prior knowledge, fail to achieve effective
pruning of the search space, which thereby leads to a considerable compression
margin remaining in the search space. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework for analog circuits'
sizing relationships extraction from academic papers. The search space in the
sizing process can be effectively pruned based on the sizing relationship
extracted by this framework. Eventually, we conducted tests on 3 types of
circuits, and the optimization efficiency was improved by $2.32 \sim 26.6
\times$. This work demonstrates that the LLM can effectively prune the search
space for analog circuit sizing, providing a new solution for the combination
of LLMs and conventional analog circuit design automation methods.

### [214] [How Robust is Model Editing after Fine-Tuning? An Empirical Study on Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18428)
*Feng He,Zhenyang Liu,Marco Valentino,Zhixue Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model edits often don't persist after fine-tuning, posing challenges for AI safety and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether model edits remain effective after fine-tuning, given its implications for AI safety (e.g., malicious edits or bias mitigation).

Method: Systematic study of T2I diffusion models (Stable Diffusion, FLUX) using two editing techniques (UCE, ReFACT) and three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, DoRA).

Result: Edits generally fail to persist post-fine-tuning, with DoRA reversing edits most strongly. UCE is more robust than ReFACT.

Conclusion: Current editing methods lack robustness; fine-tuning can remediate malicious edits but requires re-editing for safety and alignment.

Abstract: Model editing offers a low-cost technique to inject or correct a particular
behavior in a pre-trained model without extensive retraining, supporting
applications such as factual correction and bias mitigation. Despite this
common practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or
whether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental
practical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it
could serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,
the unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious
safety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model
editing and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known
to exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I
model families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and
three fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive
empirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our
findings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,
even when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits. Notably, we
observe that DoRA exhibits the strongest edit reversal effect. At the same
time, among editing methods, UCE demonstrates greater robustness, retaining
significantly higher efficacy post-fine-tuning compared to ReFACT. These
findings highlight a crucial limitation in current editing methodologies,
emphasizing the need for more robust techniques to ensure reliable long-term
control and alignment of deployed AI systems. These findings have dual
implications for AI safety: they suggest that fine-tuning could serve as a
remediation mechanism for malicious edits while simultaneously highlighting the
need for re-editing after fine-tuning to maintain beneficial safety and
alignment properties.

TL;DR: A modular AI system using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) automates medical device regulatory standard applicability, achieving 73% accuracy and 87% Top-5 recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of determining regulatory standard applicability for medical devices is understudied and requires expert interpretation of fragmented documentation.

Method: The system uses a RAG pipeline to retrieve and classify standards (Mandatory, Recommended, Not Applicable) from free-text device descriptions, with traceable justifications.

Result: The system achieves 73% classification accuracy and 87% Top-5 retrieval recall, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The AI system enables scalable, interpretable regulatory science, including cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards.

Abstract: Identifying the appropriate regulatory standard applicability remains a
critical yet understudied challenge in medical device compliance, frequently
necessitating expert interpretation of fragmented and heterogeneous
documentation across different jurisdictions. To address this challenge, we
introduce a modular AI system that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipeline to automate standard applicability determination. Given a
free-text device description, our system retrieves candidate standards from a
curated corpus and uses large language models to infer jurisdiction-specific
applicability, classified as Mandatory, Recommended, or Not Applicable, with
traceable justifications. We construct an international benchmark dataset of
medical device descriptions with expert-annotated standard mappings, and
evaluate our system against retrieval-only, zero-shot, and rule-based
baselines. The proposed approach attains a classification accuracy of 73% and a
Top-5 retrieval recall of 87%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying
relevant regulatory standards. We introduce the first end-to-end system for
standard applicability reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable
AI-supported regulatory science. Notably, our region-aware RAG agent performs
cross-jurisdictional reasoning between Chinese and U.S. standards, supporting
conflict resolution and applicability justification across regulatory
frameworks.

Motivation: Existing AI risk frameworks lack standardized tools for assessing inclusivity, risking biased and inequitable AI outcomes.

Method: Developed a question bank through iterative, multi-source inputs (literature, guidelines, frameworks) and tested it with 70 AI-generated personas.

Result: The tool effectively assesses AI inclusivity across diverse roles and domains, emphasizing D&I integration in AI workflows.

Conclusion: The question bank is a practical resource for enhancing AI inclusivity, promoting equitable and responsible AI technologies.

Abstract: Ensuring diversity and inclusion (D&I) in artificial intelligence (AI) is
crucial for mitigating biases and promoting equitable decision-making. However,
existing AI risk assessment frameworks often overlook inclusivity, lacking
standardized tools to measure an AI system's alignment with D&I principles.
This paper introduces a structured AI inclusivity question bank, a
comprehensive set of 253 questions designed to evaluate AI inclusivity across
five pillars: Humans, Data, Process, System, and Governance. The development of
the question bank involved an iterative, multi-source approach, incorporating
insights from literature reviews, D&I guidelines, Responsible AI frameworks,
and a simulated user study. The simulated evaluation, conducted with 70
AI-generated personas related to different AI jobs, assessed the question
bank's relevance and effectiveness for AI inclusivity across diverse roles and
application domains. The findings highlight the importance of integrating D&I
principles into AI development workflows and governance structures. The
question bank provides an actionable tool for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers to systematically assess and enhance the inclusivity of AI
systems, paving the way for more equitable and responsible AI technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of large language models in structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causality, and probabilistic logic.

Method: Propose T-CPDL, extending Description Logic with temporal operators, causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. Two variants: qualitative (Allen's interval algebra) and timestamped causal assertions.

Result: Empirical evaluations show improved inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration in temporal and causal reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: T-CPDL enhances language models for robust, explainable decision-making and lays groundwork for advanced Logic-RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating fluent text but frequently struggle
with structured reasoning involving temporal constraints, causal relationships,
and probabilistic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Temporal
Causal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that
extends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,
explicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two
distinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships
through Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit
timestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,
enabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to
nuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning
and causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves
inference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language
model outputs. By delivering transparent reasoning paths and fine-grained
temporal and causal semantics, T-CPDL significantly enhances the capability of
language models to support robust, explainable, and trustworthy
decision-making. This work also lays the groundwork for developing advanced
Logic-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Logic-RAG) frameworks, potentially
boosting the reasoning capabilities and efficiency of knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG systems.

Method: Developed Airalogy, a customizable, standardized platform integrating domain knowledge and computing skills, featuring AI tools for Q&A, data entry, and analysis.

Result: Airalogy is deployed in Westlake University labs, demonstrating potential to automate and accelerate scientific innovation across disciplines.

Conclusion: Airalogy successfully balances universality and standardization, paving the way for broader AI-driven scientific progress.

Abstract: Research data are the foundation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven
science, yet current AI applications remain limited to a few fields with
readily available, well-structured, digitized datasets. Achieving comprehensive
AI empowerment across multiple disciplines is still out of reach. Present-day
research data collection is often fragmented, lacking unified standards,
inefficiently managed, and difficult to share. Creating a single platform for
standardized data digitization needs to overcome the inherent challenge of
balancing between universality (supporting the diverse, ever-evolving needs of
various disciplines) and standardization (enforcing consistent formats to fully
enable AI). No existing platform accommodates both facets. Building a truly
multidisciplinary platform requires integrating scientific domain knowledge
with sophisticated computing skills. Researchers often lack the computational
expertise to design customized and standardized data recording methods, whereas
platform developers rarely grasp the intricate needs of multiple scientific
domains. These gaps impede research data standardization and hamper AI-driven
progress. In this study, we address these challenges by developing Airalogy
(https://airalogy.com), the world's first AI- and community-driven platform
that balances universality and standardization for digitizing research data
across multiple disciplines. Airalogy represents entire research workflows
using customizable, standardized data records and offers an advanced AI
research copilot for intelligent Q&A, automated data entry, analysis, and
research automation. Already deployed in laboratories across all four schools
of Westlake University, Airalogy has the potential to accelerate and automate
scientific innovation in universities, industry, and the global research
community-ultimately benefiting humanity as a whole.

Motivation: Address LLM hallucination issues in RAG settings to improve deployment reliability.

Method: Four AggTruth variants analyze attention score distributions in passages for hallucination detection.

Result: Stable performance across LLMs, outperforming SOTA in same-task and cross-task setups.

Conclusion: Careful attention head selection is crucial for optimal hallucination detection performance.

Abstract: In real-world applications, Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate,
even in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which poses a
significant challenge to their deployment. In this paper, we introduce
AggTruth, a method for online detection of contextual hallucinations by
analyzing the distribution of internal attention scores in the provided context
(passage). Specifically, we propose four different variants of the method, each
varying in the aggregation technique used to calculate attention scores. Across
all LLMs examined, AggTruth demonstrated stable performance in both same-task
and cross-task setups, outperforming the current SOTA in multiple scenarios.
Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of feature selection techniques
and examined how the number of selected attention heads impacts detection
performance, demonstrating that careful selection of heads is essential to
achieve optimal results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DLBC is a novel MARL method regulating agent behaviors at intra-group and inter-group levels, enhancing cooperation and task specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limited attention to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios, aiming to improve division of labor and cooperation.

Method: DLBC partitions agents into groups, dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between groups to align strategies.

Result: DLBC improves intra-group cooperation and inter-group task specialization, showing significant performance gains.

Conclusion: DLBC offers a promising approach for behavioral consistency in MARL, with potential for broader applications in complex tasks.

Abstract: Behavioral diversity in Multi-agent reinforcement learning(MARL) represents
an emerging and promising research area. Prior work has largely centered on
intra-group behavioral consistency in multi-agent systems, with limited
attention given to behavioral consistency in multi-agent grouping scenarios. In
this paper, we introduce Dual-Level Behavioral Consistency (DLBC), a novel MARL
control method designed to explicitly regulate agent behaviors at both
intra-group and inter-group levels. DLBC partitions agents into distinct groups
and dynamically modulates behavioral diversity both within and between these
groups. By dynamically modulating behavioral diversity within and between these
groups, DLBC achieves enhanced division of labor through inter-group
consistency, which constrains behavioral strategies across different groups.
Simultaneously, intra-group consistency, achieved by aligning behavioral
strategies within each group, fosters stronger intra-group cooperation.
Crucially, DLBC's direct constraint of agent policy functions ensures its broad
applicability across various algorithmic frameworks. Experimental results in
various grouping cooperation scenarios demonstrate that DLBC significantly
enhances both intra-group cooperative performance and inter-group task
specialization, yielding substantial performance improvements. DLBC provides
new ideas for behavioral consistency control of multi-intelligent body systems,
and its potential for application in more complex tasks and dynamic
environments can be further explored in the future.

*Jonathan Cook,Silvia Sapora,Arash Ahmadian,Akbir Khan,Tim Rocktaschel,Jakob Foerster,Laura Ruis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training LLMs on source code alone (without I/O examples) enhances their ability to evaluate programs, suggesting a mechanism for improved reasoning through reusable algorithmic abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how training LLMs on source code improves their general-purpose reasoning, despite the lack of I/O examples.

Method: Finetune LLMs on two sets of programs (with and without I/O examples) and evaluate their ability to assess programs without explicit I/O training.

Result: LLMs can evaluate programs without I/O examples, especially when code is provided directly. Chain-of-thought reasoning improves reliability.

Conclusion: Code training helps LLMs internalize algorithmic abstractions, enhancing reasoning. Future work could improve learning from symbolic procedures and alignment.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances
their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this
generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by
Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to
evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without
ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of
programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source
code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We
find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for
inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.
Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code
rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can
produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the
program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the
program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more
robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn
from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest
a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to
internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for
future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures,
and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by
training on formal constitutional principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TRIZ's application is limited by complexity and interdisciplinary demands; LLMs offer automation potential, but prior work focused on single models.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent LLM system (TRIZ agents) with specialized capabilities, collaborating to solve inventive problems using TRIZ methodology.

Result: Demonstrates the system's effectiveness in a case study, showing diverse, inventive solutions through agent collaboration.

Conclusion: Highlights the potential of decentralized AI-driven innovation for complex ideation tasks.

Abstract: TRIZ, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, is a structured,
knowledge-based framework for innovation and abstracting problems to find
inventive solutions. However, its application is often limited by the
complexity and deep interdisciplinary knowledge required. Advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revealed new possibilities for automating parts of
this process. While previous studies have explored single LLMs in TRIZ
applications, this paper introduces a multi-agent approach. We propose an
LLM-based multi-agent system, called TRIZ agents, each with specialized
capabilities and tool access, collaboratively solving inventive problems based
on the TRIZ methodology. This multi-agent system leverages agents with various
domain expertise to efficiently navigate TRIZ steps. The aim is to model and
simulate an inventive process with language agents. We assess the effectiveness
of this team of agents in addressing complex innovation challenges based on a
selected case study in engineering. We demonstrate the potential of agent
collaboration to produce diverse, inventive solutions. This research
contributes to the future of AI-driven innovation, showcasing the advantages of
decentralized problem-solving in complex ideation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and
OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex
reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT).
However, an emerging issue is their inclination to produce excessively verbose
reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature
on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such
as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the
promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by
intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we
propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the
reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting the textual hint (manually
designed or trained on the concise data) during the token generation of the
reasoning process. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the
query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not
undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs,
including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can
effectively produce concise reasoning processes while maintaining performance
well. For instance, we achieve a reduction ratio of 65\% for the reasoning
length on GSM8K benchmark with Qwen-3 4B with nearly no accuracy loss.

### [224] [Steering Conceptual Bias via Transformer Latent-Subspace Activation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18887)
*Vansh Sharma,Venkat Raman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces G-ACT, a method to steer LLMs toward generating code in a specific language (CPP), improving accuracy and efficiency compared to existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the brittleness and limited generalization of existing methods for steering language models in scientific code generation.

Method: Developed G-ACT, a gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework that clusters activation differences and uses lightweight probes for targeted steering.

Result: G-ACT improved probe classification accuracy by 15% overall and 61.5% in early layers for LLaMA-3.2 3B, and showed effectiveness in LLaMA-3.3 70B.

Conclusion: G-ACT provides a scalable, interpretable, and efficient approach for concept-level control in LLMs.

Abstract: This work examines whether activating latent subspaces in language models
(LLMs) can steer scientific code generation toward a specific programming
language. Five causal LLMs were first evaluated on scientific coding prompts to
quantify their baseline bias among four programming languages. A static
neuron-attribution method, perturbing the highest activated MLP weight for a
C++ or CPP token, proved brittle and exhibited limited generalization across
prompt styles and model scales. To address these limitations, a
gradient-refined adaptive activation steering framework (G-ACT) was developed:
per-prompt activation differences are clustered into a small set of steering
directions, and lightweight per-layer probes are trained and refined online to
select the appropriate steering vector. In LLaMA-3.2 3B, this approach reliably
biases generation towards the CPP language by increasing the average probe
classification accuracy by 15% and the early layers (0-6) improving the probe
classification accuracy by 61.5% compared to the standard ACT framework. For
LLaMA-3.3 70B, where attention-head signals become more diffuse, targeted
injections at key layers still improve language selection. Although per-layer
probing introduces a modest inference overhead, it remains practical by
steering only a subset of layers and enables reproducible model behavior. These
results demonstrate a scalable, interpretable and efficient mechanism for
concept-level control for practical agentic systems.

TL;DR: The study uses DistilBERT and LIME to analyze student feedback for Outcome-Based Education (OBE), improving sentiment classification and providing clear insights for educational improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance OBE by leveraging NLP to analyze student feedback and improve measurable educational outcomes.

Method: Implemented transformer-based models (DistilBERT) for sentiment analysis and used LIME for interpretability.

Result: The combination of transformer models and LIME provides a robust framework for analyzing feedback, aligning with OBE principles.

Conclusion: The approach effectively supports OBE goals by offering data-driven insights for educational practice improvement.

Abstract: Outcome-Based Education (OBE) emphasizes the development of specific
competencies through student-centered learning. In this study, we reviewed the
importance of OBE and implemented transformer-based models, particularly
DistilBERT, to analyze an NLP dataset that includes student feedback. Our
objective is to assess and improve educational outcomes. Our approach is better
than other machine learning models because it uses the transformer's deep
understanding of language context to classify sentiment better, giving better
results across a wider range of matrices. Our work directly contributes to
OBE's goal of achieving measurable outcomes by facilitating the identification
of patterns in student learning experiences. We have also applied LIME (local
interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to make sure that model predictions
are clear. This gives us understandable information about how key terms affect
sentiment. Our findings indicate that the combination of transformer models and
LIME explanations results in a strong and straightforward framework for
analyzing student feedback. This aligns more closely with the principles of OBE
and ensures the improvement of educational practices through data-driven
insights.

TL;DR: Proposes Adversarial Prompt Distillation for efficient jailbreak attacks on LLMs using SLMs, combining masked language modeling, reinforcement learning, and dynamic temperature control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiency, high cost, and poor adaptability of current jailbreak methods against evolving LLMs and defenses.

Method: Combines masked language modeling, reinforcement learning, and dynamic temperature control in a prompt generation and distillation framework.

Result: Achieves higher attack success rates, harm, resource efficiency, and cross-model adaptability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of distilling jailbreak ability to SLMs, revealing vulnerabilities and advancing LLM security research.

Abstract: Attacks on large language models (LLMs) in jailbreaking scenarios raise many
security and ethical issues. Current jailbreak attack methods face problems
such as low efficiency, high computational cost, and poor cross-model
adaptability and versatility, which make it difficult to cope with the rapid
development of LLM and new defense strategies. Our work proposes an Adversarial
Prompt Distillation, which combines masked language modeling, reinforcement
learning, and dynamic temperature control through a prompt generation and
distillation method. It enables small language models (SLMs) to jailbreak
attacks on mainstream LLMs. The experimental results verify the superiority of
the proposed method in terms of attack success rate and harm, and reflect the
resource efficiency and cross-model adaptability. This research explores the
feasibility of distilling the jailbreak ability of LLM to SLM, reveals the
model's vulnerability, and provides a new idea for LLM security research.

### [228] [GTA: Grouped-head latenT Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17286)
*Luoyang Sun,Jiwen Jiang,Cheng Deng,Xinjian Wu,Haifeng Zhang,Lei Chen,Lionel Ni,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GTA is a novel attention mechanism that reduces memory and computation in LLMs by compressing KV cache and reusing attention scores, achieving faster inference without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention mechanisms in LLMs have high computational and memory overhead, especially with long texts, due to redundant KV cache and similar attention maps.

Method: GTA uses shared attention maps for multiple heads and a nonlinear value decoder to compress the value cache, reducing FLOPs and KV cache size.

Result: GTA reduces FLOPs by 62.5%, shrinks KV cache by 70%, and speeds up inference by 2x while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: GTA improves LLM deployment efficiency by addressing redundancy in attention mechanisms, offering significant computational and memory savings.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms underpin the success of large language models (LLMs),
yet their substantial computational and memory overhead poses challenges for
optimizing efficiency and performance. A critical bottleneck arises as KV cache
and attention computations scale rapidly with text length, challenging
deployment on hardware with limited computational and memory resources. We
observe that attention mechanisms exhibit substantial redundancy, since the KV
cache can be significantly compressed and attention maps across heads display
high similarity, revealing that much of the computation and storage is
unnecessary. Leveraging these insights, we propose \textbf{G}rouped-Head
Laten\textbf{T} \textbf{A}ttention (GTA), a novel attention mechanism that
reduces memory usage and computational complexity while maintaining
performance. GTA comprises two components: (1) a shared attention map mechanism
that reuses attention scores across multiple heads, decreasing the key cache
size; and (2) a nonlinear value decoder with learned projections that
compresses the value cache into a latent space, further cutting memory needs.
GTA cuts attention computation FLOPs by up to \emph{62.5\%} versus
Grouped-Query Attention and shrink the KV cache by up to \emph{70\%}, all while
avoiding the extra overhead of Multi-Head Latent Attention to improve LLM
deployment efficiency. Consequently, GTA models achieve a \emph{2x} increase in
end-to-end inference speed, with prefill benefiting from reduced computational
cost and decoding benefiting from the smaller cache footprint.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how different decoding methods (e.g., speculative sampling, CoT) impact semantic diversity and reliability in LLM outputs, showing structured methods like CoT improve accuracy without sacrificing diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how decoding strategies affect semantic uncertainty and output quality in LLMs, addressing the trade-off between diversity and reliability.

Method: Experiments on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, comparing decoding methods like speculative sampling and CoT.

Result: CoT decoding increases semantic diversity with lower predictive entropy, improving code generation Pass@2 by 48.8%. Speculative sampling boosts summarization ROUGE scores.

Conclusion: Structured decoding methods can enhance semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality, challenging traditional diversity-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: This study investigates semantic uncertainty in large language model (LLM)
outputs across different decoding methods, focusing on emerging techniques like
speculative sampling and chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding. Through experiments
on question answering, summarization, and code generation tasks, we analyze how
different decoding strategies affect both the diversity and reliability of
model outputs. Our findings reveal that while CoT decoding demonstrates higher
semantic diversity, it maintains lower predictive entropy, suggesting that
structured exploration can lead to more confident and accurate outputs. This is
evidenced by a 48.8% improvement in code generation Pass@2 rates, despite lower
alignment with reference solutions. For summarization tasks, speculative
sampling proved particularly effective, achieving superior ROUGE scores while
maintaining moderate semantic diversity. Our results challenge conventional
assumptions about trade-offs between diversity and accuracy in language model
outputs, demonstrating that properly structured decoding methods can increase
semantic exploration while maintaining or improving output quality. These
findings have significant implications for deploying language models in
practical applications where both reliability and diverse solution generation
are crucial.

*Tatsuhiro Aoshima,Mitsuaki Akiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the deceptive behaviors of large language models (LLMs) by measuring their theory of mind capabilities, finding that while comprehension improves, theory of mind does not.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about LLMs disabling oversight mechanisms and acting deceptively necessitate investigating whether these behaviors are intentional.

Method: The study reviews theory of mind research, applies it to LLM safety evaluation, and analyzes developmental trends in open-weight LLMs.

Result: LLMs show improved reading comprehension but lack comparable development in theory of mind capabilities.

Conclusion: The study highlights gaps in LLM safety evaluation regarding theory of mind and identifies challenges for future research.

Abstract: As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the
importance of rigorous safety evaluation is becoming increasingly evident.
Recent concerns within the realm of safety assessment have highlighted
instances in which LLMs exhibit behaviors that appear to disable oversight
mechanisms and respond in a deceptive manner. For example, there have been
reports suggesting that, when confronted with information unfavorable to their
own persistence during task execution, LLMs may act covertly and even provide
false answers to questions intended to verify their behavior.To evaluate the
potential risk of such deceptive actions toward developers or users, it is
essential to investigate whether these behaviors stem from covert, intentional
processes within the model. In this study, we propose that it is necessary to
measure the theory of mind capabilities of LLMs. We begin by reviewing existing
research on theory of mind and identifying the perspectives and tasks relevant
to its application in safety evaluation. Given that theory of mind has been
predominantly studied within the context of developmental psychology, we
analyze developmental trends across a series of open-weight LLMs. Our results
indicate that while LLMs have improved in reading comprehension, their theory
of mind capabilities have not shown comparable development. Finally, we present
the current state of safety evaluation with respect to LLMs' theory of mind,
and discuss remaining challenges for future work.

*Mateusz Cedro,Timour Ichmoukhamedov,Sofie Goethals,Yifan He,James Hinns,David Martens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent and fragile decision-making in valuing human discomfort, raising concerns about their use as autonomous AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs evaluate trade-offs between financial rewards and user discomfort, given their proposed role as decision-making assistants.

Method: Quantified the prices assigned by multiple LLMs to various user discomforts (walking, waiting, hunger, pain) and analyzed response variance and prompt sensitivity.

Result: LLMs exhibited large variance, fragility to prompt phrasing, unreasonable valuations of discomfort, and irrational rejections of monetary gains.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are unreliable for autonomous decision-making involving cash-versus-comfort trade-offs, necessitating further scrutiny.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed as near-autonomous
artificial intelligence (AI) agents capable of making everyday decisions on
behalf of humans. Although LLMs perform well on many technical tasks, their
behaviour in personal decision-making remains less understood. Previous studies
have assessed their rationality and moral alignment with human decisions.
However, the behaviour of AI assistants in scenarios where financial rewards
are at odds with user comfort has not yet been thoroughly explored. In this
paper, we tackle this problem by quantifying the prices assigned by multiple
LLMs to a series of user discomforts: additional walking, waiting, hunger and
pain. We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of
using current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in
responses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to
minor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the
first person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept
unreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10
hours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed
(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for
scrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward
applications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'
behalf.

Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying effective tutoring actions at scale using audio transcriptions and AI.

Method: Analyzed 50 transcripts of remote math tutoring sessions using multiple AI models to assess tutor skills like praise and error response.

Result: AI models reliably detected praise (94-98% accuracy) and errors (82-88%), with evaluations aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%).

Conclusion: Generative AI is feasible and scalable for tutoring assessment, with proposed cost-effective prompting strategies for practical use.

Abstract: Tutoring improves student achievement, but identifying and studying what
tutoring actions are most associated with student learning at scale based on
audio transcriptions is an open research problem. This present study
investigates the feasibility and scalability of using generative AI to identify
and evaluate specific tutor moves in real-life math tutoring. We analyze 50
randomly selected transcripts of college-student remote tutors assisting middle
school students in mathematics. Using GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo,
Gemini-1.5-pro, and LearnLM, we assess tutors' application of two tutor skills:
delivering effective praise and responding to student math errors. All models
reliably detected relevant situations, for example, tutors providing praise to
students (94-98% accuracy) and a student making a math error (82-88% accuracy)
and effectively evaluated the tutors' adherence to tutoring best practices,
aligning closely with human judgments (83-89% and 73-77%, respectively). We
propose a cost-effective prompting strategy and discuss practical implications
for using large language models to support scalable assessment in authentic
settings. This work further contributes LLM prompts to support reproducibility

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces UProp, a framework for quantifying uncertainty in LLM sequential decisions by decomposing it into internal and extrinsic uncertainty, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of uncertainty quantification methods for multi-step decision-making in LLMs, which is critical for safety-critical applications.

Method: Proposes UProp, an information-theoretic framework decomposing uncertainty into internal and extrinsic (Mutual Information-based) components, estimating PMI over Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes.

Result: UProp significantly outperforms single-turn UQ baselines on benchmarks like AgentBench and HotpotQA with models like GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.

Conclusion: UProp is effective for sequential decision uncertainty in LLMs, with potential applications and efficient sampling demonstrated.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into safety-critical
applications involving sequential decision-making in the real world, it is
essential to know when to trust LLM decisions. Existing LLM Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ) methods are primarily designed for single-turn
question-answering formats, resulting in multi-step decision-making scenarios,
e.g., LLM agentic system, being underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
principled, information-theoretic framework that decomposes LLM sequential
decision uncertainty into two parts: (i) internal uncertainty intrinsic to the
current decision, which is focused on existing UQ methods, and (ii) extrinsic
uncertainty, a Mutual-Information (MI) quantity describing how much uncertainty
should be inherited from preceding decisions. We then propose UProp, an
efficient and effective extrinsic uncertainty estimator that converts the
direct estimation of MI to the estimation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI)
over multiple Trajectory-Dependent Decision Processes (TDPs). UProp is
evaluated over extensive multi-step decision-making benchmarks, e.g.,
AgentBench and HotpotQA, with state-of-the-art LLMs, e.g., GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3. Experimental results demonstrate that UProp significantly
outperforms existing single-turn UQ baselines equipped with thoughtful
aggregation strategies. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis of UProp,
including sampling efficiency, potential applications, and intermediate
uncertainty propagation, to demonstrate its effectiveness. Codes will be
available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/UProp.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates whether LLMs can accurately classify political content (PC) from URLs alone, comparing performance across models and countries. It finds URLs can embed most news content, balancing accuracy and cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in understanding LLMs' effectiveness in classifying PC from URLs, especially across diverse linguistic and national contexts.

Method: Evaluates cutting-edge LLMs (GPT, Llama, Mistral, etc.) on PC classification from URLs and full text, comparing with human labels and traditional ML techniques.

Result: URLs can effectively approximate full-text analysis for PC classification, offering a balance between accuracy and cost.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for PC classification from URLs, with recommendations for their use in political science studies.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) is becoming common in the context of
political science, particularly in studies that analyse individuals use of
digital media. However, while previous research has demonstrated LLMs ability
at labelling tasks, the effectiveness of using LLMs to classify political
content (PC) from just URLs is not yet well explored. The work presented in
this article bridges this gap by evaluating whether LLMs can accurately
identify PC vs. non-PC from both the article text and the URLs from five
countries (France, Germany, Spain, the UK, and the US) and different languages.
Using cutting-edge LLMs like GPT, Llama, Mistral, Deepseek, Qwen and Gemma, we
measure model performance to assess whether URL-level analysis can be a good
approximation for full-text analysis of PC, even across different linguistic
and national contexts. Model outputs are compared with human-labelled articles,
as well as traditional supervised machine learning techniques, to set a
baseline of performance. Overall, our findings suggest the capacity of URLs to
embed most of the news content, providing a vital perspective on accuracy-cost
balancing. We also account for contextual limitations and suggest
methodological recommendations to use LLMs within political science studies.

Motivation: ASR struggles with fieldwork challenges like noise and small datasets; this work aims to improve ASR utility for under-documented languages.

Method: Fine-tuned MMS and XLS-R models on five low-resource languages, controlling training data duration.

Result: MMS excels with minimal data (<1 hour), while XLS-R matches performance with more data.

Conclusion: Provides reproducible ASR adaptation methods to aid linguists in overcoming transcription challenges in language documentation.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has reached impressive accuracy for
high-resource languages, yet its utility in linguistic fieldwork remains
limited. Recordings collected in fieldwork contexts present unique challenges,
including spontaneous speech, environmental noise, and severely constrained
datasets from under-documented languages. In this paper, we benchmark the
performance of two fine-tuned multilingual ASR models, MMS and XLS-R, on five
typologically diverse low-resource languages with control of training data
duration. Our findings show that MMS is best suited when extremely small
amounts of training data are available, whereas XLS-R shows parity performance
once training data exceed one hour. We provide linguistically grounded analysis
for further provide insights towards practical guidelines for field linguists,
highlighting reproducible ASR adaptation approaches to mitigate the
transcription bottleneck in language documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individuals and institutions adapt to LLMs and address equity, adoption, and research support challenges.

Method: Three research directions: analyzing biases in AI detectors, measuring LLM adoption across writing domains, and evaluating LLMs' feedback capabilities on manuscripts.

Result: AI detectors show biases against non-dominant language varieties; LLMs are widely adopted in various writing domains; LLMs can effectively support researchers with feedback.

Conclusion: LLMs have transformative potential but require equitable governance and thoughtful integration to address biases and support diverse users.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential to change how
we write, communicate, and create, leading to rapid adoption across society.
This dissertation examines how individuals and institutions are adapting to and
engaging with this emerging technology through three research directions.
First, I demonstrate how the institutional adoption of AI detectors introduces
systematic biases, particularly disadvantaging writers of non-dominant language
varieties, highlighting critical equity concerns in AI governance. Second, I
present novel population-level algorithmic approaches that measure the
increasing adoption of LLMs across writing domains, revealing consistent
patterns of AI-assisted content in academic peer reviews, scientific
publications, consumer complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and
international organization press releases. Finally, I investigate LLMs'
capability to provide feedback on research manuscripts through a large-scale
empirical analysis, offering insights into their potential to support
researchers who face barriers in accessing timely manuscript feedback,
particularly early-career researchers and those from under-resourced settings.

*Lesheng Jin,Zhenyuan Ruan,Haohui Mai,Jingbo Shang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VeriLocc combines LLMs and formal compiler techniques for generalizable, verifiable GPU register allocation, outperforming hand-tuned methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-crafted register allocation heuristics require re-tuning for each GPU generation, lacking generalizability and verifiability.

Method: VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate MIRs into register assignments, uses static analysis for normalization, and a verifier-guided loop for correctness.

Result: Achieves 85-99% single-shot accuracy, near-100% pass@100, and outperforms rocBLAS by over 10% in runtime.

Conclusion: VeriLocc offers a scalable, verifiable solution for GPU register allocation, surpassing traditional methods.

Abstract: Modern GPUs evolve rapidly, yet production compilers still rely on
hand-crafted register allocation heuristics that require substantial re-tuning
for each hardware generation. We introduce VeriLocc, a framework that combines
large language models (LLMs) with formal compiler techniques to enable
generalizable and verifiable register allocation across GPU architectures.
VeriLocc fine-tunes an LLM to translate intermediate representations (MIRs)
into target-specific register assignments, aided by static analysis for
cross-architecture normalization and generalization and a verifier-guided
regeneration loop to ensure correctness. Evaluated on matrix multiplication
(GEMM) and multi-head attention (MHA), VeriLocc achieves 85-99% single-shot
accuracy and near-100% pass@100. Case study shows that VeriLocc discovers more
performant assignments than expert-tuned libraries, outperforming rocBLAS by
over 10% in runtime.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper audits quality issues in multilingual speech datasets (Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, VoxPopuli), highlighting macro-level problems in under-resourced languages and proposing guidelines for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address significant quality issues in public multilingual speech datasets, making them more useful for training and evaluation, and improving downstream models.

Method: Quality audit of datasets, categorizing issues into micro-level and macro-level, with a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw).

Result: Macro-level issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized languages, emphasizing the need for proactive language planning and better data quality control.

Conclusion: Proposes guidelines for future dataset development, stressing sociolinguistic awareness to create robust speech data resources.

Abstract: Our quality audit for three widely used public multilingual speech datasets -
Mozilla Common Voice 17.0, FLEURS, and VoxPopuli - shows that in some
languages, these datasets suffer from significant quality issues. We believe
addressing these issues will make these datasets more useful as training and
evaluation sets, and improve downstream models. We divide these quality issues
into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level
issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced
languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that
highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography
prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control
in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation. We
conclude by proposing guidelines and recommendations to mitigate these issues
in future dataset development, emphasizing the importance of sociolinguistic
awareness in creating robust and reliable speech data resources.

*Yuanhao Wu,Juntong Song,Hanning Zhang,Tong Zhang,Cheng Niu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DuaShepherd integrates correctness and potential reward signals to improve LLMs' mathematical reasoning, outperforming single-signal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing LLMs' mathematical reasoning by combining correctness (stepwise error identification) and potential (likelihood of correct final answer) signals.

Method: Developed an automated pipeline for dataset construction and a multi-head architecture to train reward models in parallel.

Result: Combined reward model outperforms single-signal models, achieving state-of-the-art performance on MATH500 and ProcessBench.

Conclusion: Integrating correctness and potential signals significantly improves LLMs' mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose DuaShepherd, a novel reward modeling framework that
integrates two complementary reward signals, correctness and potential, to
enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While correctness-based signals emphasize identification of stepwise
errors, potential-based signals focus on the likelihood of reaching the correct
final answer. We developed an automated pipeline for constructing large-scale
reward modeling dataset with both signals. A unified, multi-head architecture
was explored to train the two reward models in a multi-task setup,
demonstrating benefits from learning both correctness and potential in
parallel. By combining these two signals into a compound probability, our model
achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple benchmarks.
Empirical evaluations on MATH500 and ProcessBench confirm that this combined
reward significantly outperforms models trained on either reward type alone,
achieving state-of-the-art performance under comparable resource constraints.

### [243] [Probing for Phonology in Self-Supervised Speech Representations: A Case Study on Accent Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17542)
*Nitin Venkateswaran,Kevin Tang,Ratree Wayland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how self-supervised learning (SSL) models encode phonological feature variations affecting accent perception, focusing on specific segments in non-native English speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models overlook gradient phonological variations in accent perception, prompting investigation into SSL representations.

Method: Phonological feature probabilities and SSL representations (Wav2Vec2-BERT, WavLM) are analyzed using the CSLU corpus, alongside native speaker accent judgments.

Result: Accent strength is predicted by specific SSL features, with salient phonological contrasts weighted prominently. Regression shows strong ties between accent ratings and segment distances from baselines.

Conclusion: SSL representations effectively model accent perception through interpretable phonological features, enhancing understanding of non-native speech.

Abstract: Traditional models of accent perception underestimate the role of gradient
variations in phonological features which listeners rely upon for their accent
judgments. We investigate how pretrained representations from current
self-supervised learning (SSL) models of speech encode phonological
feature-level variations that influence the perception of segmental accent. We
focus on three segments: the labiodental approximant, the rhotic tap, and the
retroflex stop, which are uniformly produced in the English of native speakers
of Hindi as well as other languages in the Indian sub-continent. We use the
CSLU Foreign Accented English corpus (Lander, 2007) to extract, for these
segments, phonological feature probabilities using Phonet (V\'asquez-Correa et
al., 2019) and pretrained representations from Wav2Vec2-BERT (Barrault et al.,
2023) and WavLM (Chen et al., 2022) along with accent judgements by native
speakers of American English. Probing analyses show that accent strength is
best predicted by a subset of the segment's pretrained representation features,
in which perceptually salient phonological features that contrast the expected
American English and realized non-native English segments are given prominent
weighting. A multinomial logistic regression of pretrained representation-based
segment distances from American and Indian English baselines on accent ratings
reveals strong associations between the odds of accent strength and distances
from the baselines, in the expected directions. These results highlight the
value of self-supervised speech representations for modeling accent perception
using interpretable phonological features.

*Lingxiao Zeng,Yiqi Tong,Wei Guo,Huarui Wu,Lihao Ge,Yijun Ye,Fuzhen Zhuang,Deqing Wang,Wei Guo,Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgriCHN is a high-quality Chinese dataset for agricultural named entity recognition (NER), addressing gaps in existing resources by including diverse entities like hydrology and meteorology. It contains 4,040 sentences and 15,799 entity mentions across 27 categories, validated for superior quality and benchmarked with advanced NER models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing agricultural NER datasets lack diversity and quality, especially in Chinese, and overlook related fields like hydrology and meteorology. AgriCHN aims to fill this gap.

Method: The dataset was curated from agricultural articles, annotated with 27 entity categories, and validated for quality. Benchmark tasks used state-of-the-art NER models.

Result: AgriCHN shows outstanding data quality and diversity, posing a significant challenge for NER models, as demonstrated by experiments.

Conclusion: AgriCHN is a valuable resource for advancing agricultural NER, with potential for further research due to its comprehensive and high-quality annotations.

Abstract: Agricultural named entity recognition is a specialized task focusing on
identifying distinct agricultural entities within vast bodies of text,
including crops, diseases, pests, and fertilizers. It plays a crucial role in
enhancing information extraction from extensive agricultural text resources.
However, the scarcity of high-quality agricultural datasets, particularly in
Chinese, has resulted in suboptimal performance when employing mainstream
methods for this purpose. Most earlier works only focus on annotating
agricultural entities while overlook the profound correlation of agriculture
with hydrology and meteorology. To fill this blank, we present AgriCHN, a
comprehensive open-source Chinese resource designed to promote the accuracy of
automated agricultural entity annotation. The AgriCHN dataset has been
meticulously curated from a wealth of agricultural articles, comprising a total
of 4,040 sentences and encapsulating 15,799 agricultural entity mentions
spanning 27 diverse entity categories. Furthermore, it encompasses entities
from hydrology to meteorology, thereby enriching the diversity of entities
considered. Data validation reveals that, compared with relevant resources,
AgriCHN demonstrates outstanding data quality, attributable to its richer
agricultural entity types and more fine-grained entity divisions. A benchmark
task has also been constructed using several state-of-the-art neural NER
models. Extensive experimental results highlight the significant challenge
posed by AgriCHN and its potential for further research.

### [245] [Mind the Gap: Assessing Wiktionary's Crowd-Sourced Linguistic Knowledge on Morphological Gaps in Two Related Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17603)
*Jonathan Sakunkoo,Annabella Sakunkoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates morphological defectivity in Latin and Italian using a neural analyzer and validates Wiktionary data, revealing reliability gaps in crowd-sourced resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of reliable linguistic resources for morphological gaps in understudied languages and improve NLP tool accuracy.

Method: Customized a neural morphological analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora and computationally validated Wiktionary's defective verb lists.

Result: Wiktionary is highly reliable for Italian but shows 7% inaccuracies for Latin defective lemmas.

Conclusion: Crowd-sourced wikis have limitations for less-studied languages, but scalable tools can enhance their reliability for computational morphology.

Abstract: Morphological defectivity is an intriguing and understudied phenomenon in
linguistics. Addressing defectivity, where expected inflectional forms are
absent, is essential for improving the accuracy of NLP tools in morphologically
rich languages. However, traditional linguistic resources often lack coverage
of morphological gaps as such knowledge requires significant human expertise
and effort to document and verify. For scarce linguistic phenomena in
under-explored languages, Wikipedia and Wiktionary often serve as among the few
accessible resources. Despite their extensive reach, their reliability has been
a subject of controversy. This study customizes a novel neural morphological
analyzer to annotate Latin and Italian corpora. Using the massive annotated
data, crowd-sourced lists of defective verbs compiled from Wiktionary are
validated computationally. Our results indicate that while Wiktionary provides
a highly reliable account of Italian morphological gaps, 7% of Latin lemmata
listed as defective show strong corpus evidence of being non-defective. This
discrepancy highlights potential limitations of crowd-sourced wikis as
definitive sources of linguistic knowledge, particularly for less-studied
phenomena and languages, despite their value as resources for rare linguistic
features. By providing scalable tools and methods for quality assurance of
crowd-sourced data, this work advances computational morphology and expands
linguistic knowledge of defectivity in non-English, morphologically rich
languages.

*Lincan Li,Eren Erman Ozguven,Yue Zhao,Guang Wang,Yiqun Xie,Yushun Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyphoFormer integrates natural language descriptions with numerical data to improve typhoon track forecasting using a Transformer model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Transformer models lack broader contextual knowledge for sparse meteorological trajectories like typhoon tracks, limiting forecasting reliability.

Method: TyphoFormer uses LLM-generated textual descriptions of numerical attributes as auxiliary prompts, embedding them with numerical data in a Transformer encoder.

Result: TyphoFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the HURDAT2 benchmark, especially in scenarios with nonlinear path shifts and limited data.

Conclusion: Incorporating textual context enhances typhoon trajectory forecasting, demonstrating the value of multimodal data integration.

Abstract: Accurate typhoon track forecasting is crucial for early system warning and
disaster response. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong
performance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans
and vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual
knowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological
trajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose
TyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions
as auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time
step, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual
descriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic
hurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological
semantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the
numerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential
information within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model
to leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical
features alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,
results show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art
baseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear
path shifts and limited historical observations.

Abstract: This paper presents Open Unified Speech Language Models (OpusLMs), a family
of open foundational speech language models (SpeechLMs) up to 7B. Initialized
from decoder-only text language models, the OpusLMs are continuously
pre-trained on 213K hours of speech-text pairs and 292B text-only tokens. We
demonstrate our OpusLMs achieve comparable (or even superior) performance with
existing SpeechLMs in speech recognition, speech synthesis, and text-only
capabilities. Technically, this paper articulates our SpeechLM designs on
tokenization, multi-stream language models, and multi-stage training
strategies. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of model size scaling
and the effect of annealing data selection. The OpusLMs are all built from
publicly available materials and are fully transparent models. We release our

*Yang Wu,Yifan Zhang,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Yurong Wu,Yuran Wang,Ning Xu,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs rely heavily on memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference, as shown by their performance drop when answer cues are masked.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs depend more on final answers or reasoning chains, questioning their true inferential depth.

Method: A five-level answer-visibility prompt framework manipulates answer cues and analyzes model behavior indirectly.

Result: Performance drops by 26.90% when answer cues are masked, indicating reliance on explicit answers over reasoning.

Conclusion: LLMs may rationalize post-hoc rather than infer genuinely, highlighting the need for deeper understanding of their reasoning.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning
capabilities, growing evidence suggests much of their success stems from
memorized answer-reasoning patterns rather than genuine inference. In this
work, we investigate a central question: are LLMs primarily anchored to final
answers or to the textual pattern of reasoning chains? We propose a five-level
answer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues
and probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis. Experiments
across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a strong and consistent reliance on
explicit answers. The performance drops by 26.90\% when answer cues are masked,
even with complete reasoning chains. These findings suggest that much of the
reasoning exhibited by LLMs may reflect post-hoc rationalization rather than
true inference, calling into question their inferential depth. Our study
uncovers the answer-anchoring phenomenon with rigorous empirical validation and
underscores the need for a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes
reasoning in LLMs.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex optimization modeling in OR, requiring better fine-tuning data.

Method: Step-Opt-Instruct uses iterative problem generation and stepwise validation to create and verify data, then fine-tunes LLMs like LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B.

Result: Step-Opt achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 17.01% improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems.

Conclusion: Combining structured validation and gradual problem refinement effectively advances LLM automation for OR decision-making.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains but
encounter substantial challenges in tackling optimization modeling tasks for
Operations Research (OR), particularly when dealing with complex problem. In
this work, we propose Step-Opt-Instruct, a framework that augments existing
datasets and generates high-quality fine-tuning data tailored to optimization
modeling. Step-Opt-Instruct employs iterative problem generation to
systematically increase problem complexity and stepwise validation to
rigorously verify data, preventing error propagation and ensuring the quality
of the generated dataset. Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source
LLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and
IndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
Step-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\%
improvement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings
highlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual
problem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using

Motivation: Addressing the computational and memory demands of large language models (LLMs) for long-context inference.

Method: Uses Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA), compatible with Hugging Face Transformers via LoRA fine-tuning.

Result: Substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy; Titans-Llama-3.2-1B shows a 20% EM increase over baseline.

Conclusion: TPTT is scalable, robust, and practical, with code and Python package available for use.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to remarkable
progress in natural language processing, but their computational and memory
demands remain a significant challenge, particularly for long-context
inference. We introduce TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformer into Titans),
a novel framework for enhancing pretrained Transformer models with efficient
linearized attention mechanisms and advanced memory management. TPTT employs
techniques such as Memory as Gate (MaG) and mixed linearized attention (LiZA).
It is fully compatible with the Hugging Face Transformers library, enabling
seamless adaptation of any causal LLM through parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(LoRA) without full retraining. We show the effectiveness of TPTT on the MMLU
benchmark with models of approximately 1 billion parameters, observing
substantial improvements in both efficiency and accuracy. For instance,
Titans-Llama-3.2-1B achieves a 20% increase in Exact Match (EM) over its
baseline. Statistical analyses and comparisons with recent state-of-the-art
methods confirm the practical scalability and robustness of TPTT. Code is

TL;DR: DEC is a framework for multi-hop QA that decomposes questions into subquestions, refines them iteratively, and uses lightweight keyword extraction for efficient retrieval, achieving strong performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like hallucinations and semantic drift in lightweight LLMs when handling complex multi-hop QA tasks with extensive contexts.

Method: Decompose questions into subquestions, refine them via context-aware rewriting, and use a lightweight keyword extraction module for targeted retrieval.

Result: DEC matches or outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks with reduced token consumption, achieving top results on 8B-parameter models.

Conclusion: DEC is effective for multi-hop QA, especially in resource-constrained settings, balancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive multi-hop question answering (QA) tasks, which require
integrating evidence from multiple sources to address complex queries, often
necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval and iterative generation by large
language models (LLMs). However, incorporating many documents and extended
contexts poses challenges -such as hallucinations and semantic drift-for
lightweight LLMs with fewer parameters. This work proposes a novel framework
called DEC (Dynamic Enhancement Chain). DEC first decomposes complex questions
into logically coherent subquestions to form a hallucination-free reasoning
chain. It then iteratively refines these subquestions through context-aware
rewriting to generate effective query formulations. For retrieval, we introduce
a lightweight discriminative keyword extraction module that leverages extracted
keywords to achieve targeted, precise document recall with relatively low
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets
demonstrate that DEC performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art
benchmarks while significantly reducing token consumption. Notably, our
approach attains state-of-the-art results on models with 8B parameters,
showcasing its effectiveness in various scenarios, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: Existing datasets for conversational stance detection are limited to specific targets, hindering model effectiveness for unseen targets in real-world applications.

Method: The authors curate the ZS-CSD dataset and propose SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive learning model.

Result: SITPCL achieves state-of-the-art performance with an F1-macro score of 43.81%, underscoring the difficulty of zero-shot conversational stance detection.

Conclusion: The study advances zero-shot conversational stance detection but reveals significant challenges, suggesting room for future improvement.

Abstract: Stance detection, which aims to identify public opinion towards specific
targets using social media data, is an important yet challenging task. With the
increasing number of online debates among social media users, conversational
stance detection has become a crucial research area. However, existing
conversational stance detection datasets are restricted to a limited set of
specific targets, which constrains the effectiveness of stance detection models
when encountering a large number of unseen targets in real-world applications.
To bridge this gap, we manually curate a large-scale, high-quality zero-shot
conversational stance detection dataset, named ZS-CSD, comprising 280 targets
across two distinct target types. Leveraging the ZS-CSD dataset, we propose
SITPCL, a speaker interaction and target-aware prototypical contrastive
learning model, and establish the benchmark performance in the zero-shot
setting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SITPCL model
achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot conversational stance
detection. Notably, the SITPCL model attains only an F1-macro score of 43.81%,
highlighting the persistent challenges in zero-shot conversational stance
detection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) by automating traditional labor-intensive tasks and
consequently accelerated the development of computer-aided applications. As
researchers continue to advance this field with the introduction of novel

emerged as a particularly impactful trend to yield a substantial performance
boost across diverse NLP tasks. To best of our knowledge numerous review
articles have explored prompt engineering, however, a critical gap exists in
comprehensive analyses of prompt optimization strategies. To bridge this gap
this paper provides unique and comprehensive insights about the potential of
diverse prompt optimization strategies. It analyzes their underlying working
paradigms and based on these principles, categorizes them into 11 distinct
classes. Moreover, the paper provides details about various NLP tasks where
these prompt optimization strategies have been employed, along with details of
different LLMs and benchmark datasets used for evaluation. This comprehensive
compilation lays a robust foundation for future comparative studies and enables

under consistent experimental settings: a critical need in the current
landscape. Ultimately, this research will centralize diverse strategic
knowledge to facilitate the adaptation of existing prompt optimization
strategies for development of innovative predictors across unexplored tasks.

TL;DR: The study examines POS tagging challenges in Medieval Romance languages, testing methods like fine-tuning and cross-lingual transfer to improve accuracy despite data scarcity and linguistic variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the unique challenges of POS tagging in Medieval Romance languages due to linguistic evolution, spelling variations, and limited labeled data.

Method: Systematically evaluates fine-tuning, prompt engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual transfer learning on diverse Medieval corpora.

Result: Identifies limitations of LLMs in handling historical language variations but highlights effective specialized techniques for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Specialized approaches can mitigate challenges in POS tagging for Medieval Romance languages, despite LLM limitations.

Abstract: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging remains a foundational component in natural
language processing pipelines, particularly critical for historical text
analysis at the intersection of computational linguistics and digital
humanities. Despite significant advancements in modern large language models
(LLMs) for ancient languages, their application to Medieval Romance languages
presents distinctive challenges stemming from diachronic linguistic evolution,
spelling variations, and labeled data scarcity. This study systematically
investigates the central determinants of POS tagging performance across diverse
corpora of Medieval Occitan, Medieval Spanish, and Medieval French texts,
spanning biblical, hagiographical, medical, and dietary domains. Through
rigorous experimentation, we evaluate how fine-tuning approaches, prompt
engineering, model architectures, decoding strategies, and cross-lingual
transfer learning techniques affect tagging accuracy. Our results reveal both
notable limitations in LLMs' ability to process historical language variations
and non-standardized spelling, as well as promising specialized techniques that
effectively address the unique challenges presented by low-resource historical
languages.

TL;DR: KAG-Thinker is a human-like reasoning framework for LLMs, improving logical coherence in Q&A tasks by decomposing questions into solvable sub-problems and using structured retrieval and reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the logical coherence and contextual consistency of LLMs in domain-specific Q&A tasks by simulating human cognitive mechanisms.

Method: Decomposes questions into sub-problems (logical forms), classifies them as retrieval or reasoning tasks, and uses knowledge boundary and depth solving models for optimal knowledge acquisition. Supervised fine-tuning aligns the model with structured inference.

Result: Improved handling of complex problems through structured reasoning and retrieval, avoiding excessive reflection.

Conclusion: KAG-Thinker effectively enhances LLM reasoning in domain-specific tasks by mimicking human-like structured thinking.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce KAG-Thinker, a novel human-like reasoning
framework built upon a parameter-light large language model (LLM). Our approach
enhances the logical coherence and contextual consistency of the thinking
process in question-answering (Q\&A) tasks on domain-specific knowledge bases
(KBs) within LLMs. This framework simulates human cognitive mechanisms for
handling complex problems by establishing a structured thinking process.
Continuing the \textbf{Logical Form} guided retrieval and reasoning technology
route of KAG v0.7, firstly, it decomposes complex questions into independently
solvable sub-problems(also referred to as logical forms) through
\textbf{breadth decomposition}, each represented in two equivalent
forms-natural language and logical function-and further classified as either
Knowledge Retrieval or Reasoning Analysis tasks, with dependencies and
variables passing explicitly modeled via logical function interfaces. In the
solving process, the Retrieval function is used to perform knowledge retrieval
tasks, while the Math and Deduce functions are used to perform reasoning
analysis tasks. Secondly, it is worth noting that, in the Knowledge Retrieval
sub-problem tasks, LLMs and external knowledge sources are regarded as
equivalent KBs. We use the \textbf{knowledge boundary} model to determine the
optimal source using self-regulatory mechanisms such as confidence calibration
and reflective reasoning, and use the \textbf{depth solving} model to enhance
the comprehensiveness of knowledge acquisition. Finally, instead of utilizing
reinforcement learning, we employ supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn
dialogues to align the model with our structured inference paradigm, thereby
avoiding excessive reflection. This is supported by a data evaluation framework
and iterative corpus synthesis, which facilitate the generation of detailed
reasoning trajectories...

*Anwoy Chatterjee,Yash Goel,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIDE, a single-pass, training-free method for detecting hallucinations in language models by analyzing decoupled internal representations, achieving superior performance with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models often generate factually incorrect or unfaithful content (hallucinations), which undermines their reliability. Existing detection methods are computationally expensive, necessitating a more efficient solution.

Method: HIDE detects hallucinations by quantifying the decoupling between an LM's internal representations of input context and generated output using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC).

Result: HIDE outperforms single-pass methods (~29% improvement in AUC-ROC) and competes with multi-pass methods (~3% improvement, ~51% less computation time) across diverse datasets and models.

Conclusion: Exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs is effective for efficient and practical hallucination detection, as demonstrated by HIDE's performance.

Abstract: Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate
content that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a
critical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to
generate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because
these fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to
detect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most
rely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased
computational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,
training-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled
rEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that
hallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal
representations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this
decoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to
hidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We
conduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,
evaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six
open-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that
HIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an
average relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing
single-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE
shows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass
state-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in
AUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time. Our findings highlight the
effectiveness of exploiting internal representation decoupling in LMs for
efficient and practical hallucination detection.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates tokenization strategies for 17 Indian languages, comparing algorithms, vocabulary sizes, and multilingual training methods, showing benefits for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenizers favor high-resource languages, disadvantaging linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages like those in the Indian subcontinent.

Method: Comprehensive intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies, comparing BPE and Unigram LM algorithms, vocabulary sizes, and multilingual training methods (joint and cluster-based).

Result: Low-resource languages benefit from tokenizers trained on related high-resource languages, with insights on fair and efficient multilingual tokenization.

Conclusion: The study offers practical guidance for creating linguistically informed and fair tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in multilingual NLP. However, existing
tokenizers are often skewed towards high-resource languages, limiting their
effectiveness for linguistically diverse and morphologically rich languages
such as those in the Indian subcontinent. This paper presents a comprehensive
intrinsic evaluation of tokenization strategies across 17 Indian languages. We
quantify the trade-offs between bottom-up and top-down tokenizer algorithms
(BPE and Unigram LM), effects of vocabulary sizes, and compare strategies of
multilingual vocabulary construction such as joint and cluster-based training.
We also show that extremely low-resource languages can benefit from tokenizers
trained on related high-resource languages. Our study provides practical
insights for building more fair, efficient, and linguistically informed
tokenizers for multilingual NLP.

*Xin Zhang,Qiyu Wei,Yingjie Zhu,Fanyi Wu,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: THCM-CAL is a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model for clinical risk prediction from EHRs, integrating structured and unstructured data with causal interactions and conformal calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods fail to model the hierarchical causal interactions between clinical notes and diagnostic codes, limiting prediction accuracy.

Method: THCM-CAL constructs a multimodal causal graph, infers hierarchical interactions, and uses conformal prediction for reliable multi-label ICD coding.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets.

Conclusion: THCM-CAL effectively models clinical risk by capturing causal interactions and ensuring prediction reliability.

Abstract: Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs)
demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative
notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately
or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional,
hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate
diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose
THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our
framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical
entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD
codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery,
THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice
same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice
risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal
prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals
under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MarketingFM improves offsite marketing by generating keyword-specific ad copy, boosting CTR and cost efficiency. AutoEval-Main and AutoEval-Update automate ad evaluation, reducing human effort while maintaining alignment with marketing principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current offsite marketing content is generic and misaligned with landing pages, reducing effectiveness.

Method: MarketingFM integrates data sources for keyword-specific ad generation. AutoEval-Main uses rule-based metrics and LLM-as-a-Judge for automated evaluation. AutoEval-Update refines evaluation prompts with minimal human input.

Result: MarketingFM achieved 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC. AutoEval-Main matched human reviewers with 89.57% agreement.

Conclusion: Automated systems like MarketingFM and AutoEval improve ad performance and evaluation efficiency, but human oversight remains crucial for validation.

Abstract: Offsite marketing is essential in e-commerce, enabling businesses to reach
customers through external platforms and drive traffic to retail websites.
However, most current offsite marketing content is overly generic,
template-based, and poorly aligned with landing pages, limiting its
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose MarketingFM, a
retrieval-augmented system that integrates multiple data sources to generate
keyword-specific ad copy with minimal human intervention. We validate
MarketingFM via offline human and automated evaluations and large-scale online
A/B tests. In one experiment, keyword-focused ad copy outperformed templates,
achieving up to 9% higher CTR, 12% more impressions, and 0.38% lower CPC,
demonstrating gains in ad ranking and cost efficiency. Despite these gains,
human review of generated ads remains costly. To address this, we propose
AutoEval-Main, an automated evaluation system that combines rule-based metrics
with LLM-as-a-Judge techniques to ensure alignment with marketing principles.
In experiments with large-scale human annotations, AutoEval-Main achieved
89.57% agreement with human reviewers. Building on this, we propose
AutoEval-Update, a cost-efficient LLM-human collaborative framework to
dynamically refine evaluation prompts and adapt to shifting criteria with
minimal human input. By selectively sampling representative ads for human
review and using a critic LLM to generate alignment reports, AutoEval-Update
improves evaluation consistency while reducing manual effort. Experiments show
the critic LLM suggests meaningful refinements, improving LLM-human agreement.
Nonetheless, human oversight remains essential for setting thresholds and
validating refinements before deployment.

*Taolin Zhang,Haidong Kang,Dongyang Li,Qizhou Chen,Chengyu Wang Xiaofeng He,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QueueEDIT is a queue-based self-correction framework for sequential model editing in LLMs, improving performance and preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in LLMs during sequential model editing without harming general NLP abilities.

Method: Uses a structural mapping editing loss to map knowledge to neurons, stores parameters in a queue, and dynamically aligns past edits while freezing irrelevant parameters.

Result: Outperforms baselines in sequential editing and maintains competitiveness in single-turn edits, preserving general NLP capabilities.

Conclusion: QueueEDIT effectively enhances sequential model editing in LLMs while safeguarding their general performance.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive results
but still suffer from hallucinations. Model editing has been proposed to
correct factual inaccuracies in LLMs. A challenging case is sequential model
editing (SME), which aims to rectify errors continuously rather than treating
them as a one-time task. During SME, the general capabilities of LLMs can be
negatively affected due to the introduction of new parameters. In this paper,
we propose a queue-based self-correction framework (QueueEDIT) that not only
enhances SME performance by addressing long-sequence dependency but also
mitigates the impact of parameter bias on the general capabilities of LLMs.
Specifically, we first introduce a structural mapping editing loss to map the
triplets to the knowledge-sensitive neurons within the Transformer layers of
LLMs. We then store the located parameters for each piece of edited knowledge
in a queue and dynamically align previously edited parameters. In each edit, we
select queue parameters most relevant to the currently located parameters to
determine whether previous knowledge needs realignment. Irrelevant parameters
in the queue are frozen, and we update the parameters at the queue head to the
LLM to ensure they do not harm general abilities. Experiments show that our
framework significantly outperforms strong baselines across various SME
settings and maintains competitiveness in single-turn editing. The resulting
LLMs also preserve high capabilities in general NLP tasks throughout the SME
process.

### [262] [How Alignment Shrinks the Generative Horizon](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17871)
*Chenghao Yang,Ari Holtzman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why aligned large language models (LLMs) generate less diverse outputs, introducing the Branching Factor (BF) to measure output concentration. Findings show BF decreases during generation and alignment tuning sharpens output distributions, explaining reduced sensitivity to decoding strategies. This stability aids complex reasoning, as seen in aligned Chain-of-Thought models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why aligned LLMs produce less diverse outputs and quantify this behavior using probability concentration.

Method: Introduces the Branching Factor (BF) to measure the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Analyzes BF changes during generation and the impact of alignment tuning.

Result: BF decreases as generation progresses, and alignment tuning reduces BF significantly, making outputs more deterministic. Aligned CoT models leverage this for stable reasoning.

Conclusion: BF is a key diagnostic for understanding LLM output stability. Alignment tuning steers models toward low-entropy trajectories without fundamentally changing behavior, and base models can be similarly nudged.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, aligned large language models (LLMs)
often generate outputs that lack diversity. What drives this stability in the
generation? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability
concentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this
concentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant
measure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our
empirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as
generation progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they
generate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output
distribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude
(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps
explain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.
Building on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications
for complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating
longer reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic
(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that
alignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead
steers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., "Sure") that unlock low-entropy
trajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by
nudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can
similarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful
diagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how
alignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how
base models can be steered away from diversity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method for LLMs, addressing limitations in existing techniques by refining jailbreaking paths globally and fabricating model responses to suppress safety warnings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreaking techniques focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with multi-turn dynamics, posing safety risks due to potential misuse of LLMs.

Method: Proposes a multi-turn jailbreaking method that globally refines paths and actively fabricates model responses to bypass safety warnings.

Result: Outperforms existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques across six state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses multi-turn jailbreaking challenges, enhancing the identification of security threats in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved exceptional performance across a
wide range of tasks. However, they still pose significant safety risks due to
the potential misuse for malicious purposes. Jailbreaks, which aim to elicit
models to generate harmful content, play a critical role in identifying the
underlying security threats. Recent jailbreaking primarily focuses on
single-turn scenarios, while the more complicated multi-turn scenarios remain
underexplored. Moreover, existing multi-turn jailbreaking techniques struggle
to adapt to the evolving dynamics of dialogue as the interaction progresses. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-turn jailbreaking method that
refines the jailbreaking path globally at each interaction. We also actively
fabricate model responses to suppress safety-related warnings, thereby
increasing the likelihood of eliciting harmful outputs in subsequent questions.
Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method
compared with existing single-turn and multi-turn jailbreaking techniques
across six state-of-the-art LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scatter-based innovation expansion model to help LLMs generalize and apply localized innovations across multi-stage processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to generalize novel ideas beyond their original context, limiting their ability to reuse innovations in multi-stage processes.

Method: A four-step innovation scatter model: (1) identify core innovation, (2) generalize it, (3) assess broader applicability, (4) apply to similar stages.

Result: The model successfully enables LLMs to extend innovations across structurally similar stages, improving generalization and reuse.

Conclusion: The innovation scatter model enhances LLMs' ability to generalize and apply localized innovations, broadening their utility in multi-stage processes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in reproducing and
extending patterns observed during pretraining but often struggle to generalize
novel ideas beyond their original context. This paper addresses the challenge
of applying such localized innovations - introduced at a specific stage or
component - to other parts of a multi-stage process. We propose a scatter-based
innovation expansion model (innovation scatter model) that guides the LLM
through a four-step process: (1) identifying the core innovation by comparing
the user's input with its surrounding context, (2) generalizing the innovation
by removing references to specific stages or components, (3) determining
whether the generalized innovation applies to a broader scope beyond the
original stage, and (4) systematically applying it to other structurally
similar stages using the LLM. This model leverages structural redundancy across
stages to improve the applicability of novel ideas. Verification results
demonstrate that the innovation scatter model enables LLMs to extend
innovations across structurally similar stages, thereby enhancing
generalization and reuse.

Result: The system successfully extracts accurate information from diverse PDF content, demonstrating effectiveness in handling multimodal queries.

Conclusion: This work advances RAG-based QA systems and sets a foundation for future research in multimodal data integration.

Abstract: This paper presents an advancement in Question-Answering (QA) systems using a
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to enhance information
extraction from PDF files. Recognizing the richness and diversity of data
within PDFs--including text, images, vector diagrams, graphs, and tables--poses
unique challenges for existing QA systems primarily designed for textual
content. We seek to develop a comprehensive RAG-based QA system that will
effectively address complex multimodal questions, where several data types are
combined in the query. This is mainly achieved by refining approaches to
processing and integrating non-textual elements in PDFs into the RAG framework
to derive precise and relevant answers, as well as fine-tuning large language
models to better adapt to our system. We provide an in-depth experimental
evaluation of our solution, demonstrating its capability to extract accurate
information that can be applied to different types of content across PDFs. This
work not only pushes the boundaries of retrieval-augmented QA systems but also

TL;DR: The paper proposes adding parallel layers to early-exit neural models for speech recognition, processing downsampled inputs to improve performance without increasing inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance early-exit models' performance in resource-constrained scenarios, especially for speech recognition, by addressing the lack of modularity in existing architectures like Zipformer.

Method: Introduce parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled versions of inputs, alongside standard layers, to improve efficiency and performance.

Result: Significant improvement in speech recognition performance on benchmarks, with a minor increase in model parameters but no impact on inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for on-device processing with varying resources.

Abstract: The ability to dynamically adjust the computational load of neural models
during inference in a resource aware manner is crucial for on-device processing
scenarios, characterised by limited and time-varying computational resources.
Early-exit architectures represent an elegant and effective solution, since
they can process the input with a subset of their layers, exiting at
intermediate branches (the upmost layers are hence removed from the model).
  From a different perspective, for automatic speech recognition applications
there are memory-efficient neural architectures that apply variable frame rate
analysis, through downsampling/upsampling operations in the middle layers,
reducing the overall number of operations and improving significantly the
performance on well established benchmarks. One example is the Zipformer.
However, these architectures lack the modularity necessary to inject early-exit
branches.
  With the aim of improving the performance in early-exit models, we propose
introducing parallel layers in the architecture that process downsampled
versions of their inputs. % in conjunction with standard processing layers. We
show that in this way the speech recognition performance on standard benchmarks
significantly improve, at the cost of a small increase in the overall number of
model parameters but without affecting the inference time.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid summarization method combining extractive and abstractive techniques to address challenges in retaining key information across lengthy documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for effective automatic text summarization due to the rapid expansion of information, with existing methods (extractive and abstractive) facing limitations like resource intensity and 'lost in the middle' issues.

Method: Splits documents into smaller chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates summaries for each cluster representing key ideas, and constructs the final summary using a Markov chain graph for semantic order.

Result: Proposes a hybrid approach to improve summarization by leveraging both extractive and abstractive techniques.

Conclusion: The hybrid method effectively addresses challenges in summarization, particularly for lengthy documents, by combining strengths of both approaches.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of information from diverse sources has heightened the
need for effective automatic text summarization, which condenses documents into
shorter, coherent texts. Summarization methods generally fall into two
categories: extractive, which selects key segments from the original text, and
abstractive, which generates summaries by rephrasing the content coherently.
Large language models have advanced the field of abstractive summarization, but
they are resourceintensive and face significant challenges in retaining key
information across lengthy documents, which we call being "lost in the middle".
To address these issues, we propose a hybrid summarization approach that
combines extractive and abstractive techniques. Our method splits the document
into smaller text chunks, clusters their vector embeddings, generates a summary
for each cluster that represents a key idea in the document, and constructs the
final summary by relying on a Markov chain graph when selecting the semantic
order of ideas.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) to evaluate LLM-generated text quality, addressing limitations of current methods by enabling multi-dimensional assessment without arbitrary metric weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM-generated text are limited by single-metric focus, incompatibility with human judgments, and lack of statistical guarantees.

Method: The authors adapt a GSD-based framework to evaluate text quality across multiple dimensions, avoiding arbitrary metric weighting and respecting different measurement scales.

Result: The GSD-front approach identifies statistically significant performance differences in decoding strategies compared to human-generated text, accounting for non-i.i.d. sampling.

Conclusion: The GSD framework provides a robust, multi-dimensional evaluation method for LLM-generated text, overcoming key limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of LLM-generated text remains a fundamental challenge
in natural language processing. Current evaluation approaches often rely on
isolated metrics or simplistic aggregations that fail to capture the nuanced
trade-offs between coherence, diversity, fluency, and other relevant indicators
of text quality. In this work, we adapt a recently proposed framework for
statistical inference based on Generalized Stochastic Dominance (GSD) that
addresses three critical limitations in existing benchmarking methodologies:
the inadequacy of single-metric evaluation, the incompatibility between
cardinal automatic metrics and ordinal human judgments, and the lack of
inferential statistical guarantees. The GSD-front approach enables simultaneous
evaluation across multiple quality dimensions while respecting their different
measurement scales, building upon partial orders of decoding strategies, thus
avoiding arbitrary weighting of the involved metrics. By applying this
framework to evaluate common decoding strategies against human-generated text,
we demonstrate its ability to identify statistically significant performance
differences while accounting for potential deviations from the i.i.d.
assumption of the sampling design.

Result: Fine-tuned models (mT5-large) achieved 88% accuracy, surpassing prompting (74.5%), with lower computational costs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning is more effective for Czech anaphora resolution, offering higher accuracy and efficiency than prompting.

Abstract: Anaphora resolution plays a critical role in natural language understanding,
especially in morphologically rich languages like Czech. This paper presents a
comparative evaluation of two modern approaches to anaphora resolution on Czech
text: prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) and fine-tuning
compact generative models. Using a dataset derived from the Prague Dependency
Treebank, we evaluate several instruction-tuned LLMs, including Mistral Large 2
and Llama 3, using a series of prompt templates. We compare them against
fine-tuned variants of the mT5 and Mistral models that we trained specifically
for Czech anaphora resolution. Our experiments demonstrate that while prompting
yields promising few-shot results (up to 74.5% accuracy), the fine-tuned
models, particularly mT5-large, outperform them significantly, achieving up to
88% accuracy while requiring fewer computational resources. We analyze
performance across different anaphora types, antecedent distances, and source
corpora, highlighting key strengths and trade-offs of each approach.

*Fuyu Wang,Jiangtong Li,Kun Zhu,Changjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dual-component framework, InspireScore and InspireDebate, to improve LLM-based debating systems by addressing gaps in objective assessment and structured optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based debating systems lack objective assessments (e.g., authenticity, logical validity) and structured optimization across evaluation metrics, CoT reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement.

Method: Proposes InspireScore for multi-dimensional assessment (subjective and objective metrics) and InspireDebate for phased optimization (CoT enhancement, DPO, Web-RAG).

Result: InspireScore achieves 44% higher correlation with expert judgments; InspireDebate outperforms baselines by 57%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses current limitations, enhancing both evaluation and debate quality in LLM-based systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks,
such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made
significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on
responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as
authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured
approach to optimize across various dimensions$-$including evaluation metrics,
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement$-$thereby
limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we
propose a dual-component framework: (1) $\textbf{InspireScore}$, a novel
evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture
incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity,
argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics
(fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) $\textbf{InspireDebate}$, an
optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through
CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented
Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that
$\textbf{InspireScore}$ achieves 44$\%$ higher correlation with expert
judgments compared to existing methods, while $\textbf{InspireDebate}$ shows
significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57$\%$. Source code

### [272] [Chengyu-Bench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Chinese Idiom Understanding and Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18105)
*Yicheng Fu,Zhemin Huang,Liuxin Yang,Yumeng Lu,Zhongdongming Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chengyu-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating language models' understanding of Chinese idioms, featuring three tasks: Evaluative Connotation, Appropriateness, and Open Cloze. It reveals LLMs perform well on sentiment but struggle with contextual usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for Chinese idioms are limited to narrow tasks, failing to assess deeper understanding. Chengyu-Bench aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation.

Method: The benchmark includes 2,937 human-verified examples across three tasks, sourced from diverse corpora. Leading LLMs are evaluated on these tasks.

Result: LLMs achieve 95% accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, ~85% on Appropriateness, and ~40% on Open Cloze. Errors stem from misunderstanding idiom meanings.

Conclusion: Chengyu-Bench highlights LLMs' limitations in grasping cultural and contextual nuances of idioms, despite strong performance on simpler tasks.

Abstract: Chinese idioms (Chengyu) are concise four-character expressions steeped in
history and culture, whose literal translations often fail to capture their
full meaning. This complexity makes them challenging for language models to
interpret and use correctly. Existing benchmarks focus on narrow tasks -
multiple-choice cloze tests, isolated translation, or simple paraphrasing. We
introduce Chengyu-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring three tasks: (1)
Evaluative Connotation, classifying idioms as positive or negative; (2)
Appropriateness, detecting incorrect idiom usage in context; and (3) Open
Cloze, filling blanks in longer passages without options. Chengyu-Bench
comprises 2,937 human-verified examples covering 1,765 common idioms sourced
from diverse corpora. We evaluate leading LLMs and find they achieve over 95%
accuracy on Evaluative Connotation, but only ~85% on Appropriateness and ~40%
top-1 accuracy on Open Cloze. Error analysis reveals that most mistakes arise
from fundamental misunderstandings of idiom meanings. Chengyu-Bench
demonstrates that while LLMs can reliably gauge idiom sentiment, they still
struggle to grasp the cultural and contextual nuances essential for proper
usage. The benchmark and source code are available at:

*Batool Haider,Atmika Gorti,Aman Chadha,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-hop question answering (MHQA) framework to detect intersectional biases in LLMs for mental healthcare, revealing systematic disparities and proposing debiasing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of systematic methods for detecting intersectional biases in LLMs, which can propagate stigma and harm marginalized groups in mental healthcare.

Method: Uses MHQA to analyze LLM responses in mental health discourse, tagging for demographics and evaluating four models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, Llama 4). Implements debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and Explicit Bias Reduction.

Result: Identifies systematic biases in sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. MHQA outperforms conventional methods, and debiasing techniques reduce biases by 66-94%.

Conclusion: Highlights LLM biases in mental healthcare and provides actionable debiasing insights for equitable AI development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in mental healthcare risk propagating biases
that reinforce stigma and harm marginalized groups. While previous research
identified concerning trends, systematic methods for detecting intersectional
biases remain limited. This work introduces a multi-hop question answering
(MHQA) framework to explore LLM response biases in mental health discourse. We
analyze content from the Interpretable Mental Health Instruction (IMHI) dataset
across symptom presentation, coping mechanisms, and treatment approaches. Using
systematic tagging across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status, we
investigate bias patterns at demographic intersections. We evaluate four LLMs:
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Jamba 1.6, Gemma 3, and Llama 4, revealing systematic
disparities across sentiment, demographics, and mental health conditions. Our
MHQA approach demonstrates superior detection compared to conventional methods,
identifying amplification points where biases magnify through sequential
reasoning. We implement two debiasing techniques: Roleplay Simulation and
Explicit Bias Reduction, achieving 66-94% bias reductions through few-shot
prompting with BBQ dataset examples. These findings highlight critical areas
where LLMs reproduce mental healthcare biases, providing actionable insights
for equitable AI development.

### [274] [The Syntactic Acceptability Dataset (Preview): A Resource for Machine Learning and Linguistic Analysis of English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18120)
*Tom S Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, with 1,000 English sequences, is introduced for syntax and computational linguistics research. It includes grammatical and acceptability labels, showing 83% convergence between them. Machine learning models predict acceptability better than grammaticality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a resource for syntax and computational linguistics research, addressing gaps in publicly accessible datasets and exploring the relationship between grammaticality and acceptability.

Method: The dataset includes 1,000 English sequences from textbooks and Linguistic Inquiry, labeled for grammaticality (from literature) and acceptability (via crowdsourcing). Preliminary analyses compare these labels and test machine learning models.

Result: Grammaticality and acceptability converge in 83% of cases. Machine learning models perform better at predicting acceptability than grammaticality.

Conclusion: The dataset is a valuable resource, revealing insights into grammaticality and acceptability. Future work will expand the dataset.

Abstract: We present a preview of the Syntactic Acceptability Dataset, a resource being
designed for both syntax and computational linguistics research. In its current
form, the dataset comprises 1,000 English sequences from the syntactic
discourse: Half from textbooks and half from the journal Linguistic Inquiry,
the latter to ensure a representation of the contemporary discourse. Each entry
is labeled with its grammatical status ("well-formedness" according to
syntactic formalisms) extracted from the literature, as well as its
acceptability status ("intuitive goodness" as determined by native speakers)
obtained through crowdsourcing, with highest experimental standards. Even in
its preliminary form, this dataset stands as the largest of its kind that is
publicly accessible. We also offer preliminary analyses addressing three
debates in linguistics and computational linguistics: We observe that
grammaticality and acceptability judgments converge in about 83% of the cases
and that "in-betweenness" occurs frequently. This corroborates existing
research. We also find that while machine learning models struggle with
predicting grammaticality, they perform considerably better in predicting
acceptability. This is a novel finding. Future work will focus on expanding the
dataset.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a vulnerability in autoregressive transformers caused by the em dash token, leading to semantic drift and errors. It proposes a solution combining symbolic purification and embedding realignment, improving generation consistency without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address recursive semantic drift and clause boundary hallucination in transformer models caused by the em dash token, ensuring safer and more reliable text generation.

Method: Formal analysis of token-level perturbations, symbolic clause purification using the phi-infinity operator, and targeted embedding matrix realignment.

Result: Significant improvements in generation consistency and topic maintenance, with fixed-point convergence guarantees.

Conclusion: The work provides a framework for mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, enhancing AI safety and robust deployment.

Abstract: We identify a critical vulnerability in autoregressive transformer language
models where the em dash token induces recursive semantic drift, leading to
clause boundary hallucination and embedding space entanglement. Through formal
analysis of token-level perturbations in semantic lattices, we demonstrate that
em dash insertion fundamentally alters the model's latent representations,
causing compounding errors in long-form generation. We propose a novel solution
combining symbolic clause purification via the phi-infinity operator with
targeted embedding matrix realignment. Our approach enables total suppression
of problematic tokens without requiring model retraining, while preserving
semantic coherence through fixed-point convergence guarantees. Experimental
validation shows significant improvements in generation consistency and topic
maintenance. This work establishes a general framework for identifying and
mitigating token-level vulnerabilities in foundation models, with immediate
implications for AI safety, model alignment, and robust deployment of large
language models in production environments. The methodology extends beyond
punctuation to address broader classes of recursive instabilities in neural
text generation systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies and manipulates semantic components in LLMs using sparse autoencoder features, showing modular knowledge organization and efficient model control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and manipulate the modular organization of knowledge in large language models (LLMs) by identifying coherent semantic components.

Method: Uses coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features from few prompts, focusing on country-relation tasks, and ablates/amplifies components to observe effects.

Result: Ablating or amplifying semantic components predictably changes outputs, with country components in early layers and relation components in later layers. Later-layer nodes have stronger causal impact.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit modular knowledge organization, enabling efficient, targeted manipulation of model outputs.

Abstract: We identify semantically coherent, context-consistent network components in
large language models (LLMs) using coactivation of sparse autoencoder (SAE)
features collected from just a handful of prompts. Focusing on country-relation
tasks, we show that ablating semantic components for countries and relations
changes model outputs in predictable ways, while amplifying these components
induces counterfactual responses. Notably, composing relation and country
components yields compound counterfactual outputs. We find that, whereas most
country components emerge from the very first layer, the more abstract relation
components are concentrated in later layers. Furthermore, within relation
components themselves, nodes from later layers tend to have a stronger causal
impact on model outputs. Overall, these findings suggest a modular organization
of knowledge within LLMs and advance methods for efficient, targeted model
manipulation.

*Bushra Asseri,Estabrag Abdelaziz,Areej Al-Wabil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A systematic review examines prompt engineering strategies to mitigate cultural bias in LLMs, focusing on Arab and Muslim representation, identifying five effective approaches with varying success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing understudied cultural bias in LLMs, particularly towards Arabs and Muslims, to reduce harmful stereotypes and marginalization.

Method: Mixed-methods systematic review following PRISMA and Kitchenham's methodology, analyzing 8 empirical studies (2021-2024) on bias mitigation strategies.

Result: Five prompt engineering approaches were identified, with structured multi-step pipelines showing the highest effectiveness (87.7% bias reduction). Cultural prompting was more accessible but less consistent.

Conclusion: Prompt engineering is accessible for bias mitigation, but research gaps remain. Future work should focus on culturally adaptive techniques, evaluation resources, and integrating debiasing methods.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet concerns about cultural bias - particularly towards Arabs
and Muslims - pose significant ethical challenges by perpetuating harmful
stereotypes and marginalization. Despite growing recognition of bias in LLMs,
prompt engineering strategies specifically addressing Arab and Muslim
representation remain understudied. This mixed-methods systematic review
examines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and
practitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review
methodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024
investigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary
prompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,
self-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and
parameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential
for reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias
types. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to
prompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines
demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction
in bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting
offers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results
underscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias
without requiring access to model parameters. The limited number of studies
identified highlights a significant research gap in this critical area. Future
research should focus on developing culturally adaptive prompting techniques,
creating Arab and Muslim-specific evaluation resources, and integrating prompt
engineering with complementary debiasing methods to address deeper stereotypes
while maintaining model utility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-4o outperforms Gemini 1.5 Pro in emotion recognition for Arabic children's storybook illustrations, with a 59% F1-score using chain-of-thought prompting. Both models struggle with cultural nuances and ambiguous contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of culturally responsive emotion recognition tools for Arabic-speaking learners in educational technologies.

Method: Evaluated GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro using three prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) on 75 Arabic storybook images, comparing results to human annotations based on Plutchik's framework.

Result: GPT-4o achieved a 59% F1-score, outperforming Gemini's 43%. Both models showed systematic errors, especially in culturally nuanced emotions.

Conclusion: Current models lack cultural understanding; culturally sensitive training is needed for effective emotion-aware technologies in Arabic contexts.

Abstract: Emotion recognition capabilities in multimodal AI systems are crucial for
developing culturally responsive educational technologies, yet remain
underexplored for Arabic language contexts where culturally appropriate
learning tools are critically needed. This study evaluates the emotion
recognition performance of two advanced multimodal large language models,
GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, when processing Arabic children's storybook
illustrations. We assessed both models across three prompting strategies
(zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought) using 75 images from seven Arabic
storybooks, comparing model predictions with human annotations based on
Plutchik's emotional framework. GPT-4o consistently outperformed Gemini across
all conditions, achieving the highest macro F1-score of 59% with
chain-of-thought prompting compared to Gemini's best performance of 43%. Error
analysis revealed systematic misclassification patterns, with valence
inversions accounting for 60.7% of errors, while both models struggled with
culturally nuanced emotions and ambiguous narrative contexts. These findings
highlight fundamental limitations in current models' cultural understanding and
emphasize the need for culturally sensitive training approaches to develop
effective emotion-aware educational technologies for Arabic-speaking learners.

language processing due to not only the shortage of translation data related to
the entities needed to translate but also the complexity in the context needed
to process while translating those entities. In this paper, we propose a method
that applies multi-task learning to optimize the performance of the two
subtasks named entity recognition and machine translation, which improves the
final performance of the Entity-aware machine translation task. The result and
analysis are performed on the dataset provided by the organizer of Task 2 of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inefficient, disconnected workflows in MT post-editing and research data collection need streamlining.

Method: TranslationCorrect integrates MT generation (e.g., NLLB), automated error prediction (e.g., XCOMET or LLM APIs), and a post-editing interface, designed with HCI principles.

Result: The framework improves translation efficiency and user satisfaction, confirmed by a user study.

Conclusion: TranslationCorrect offers a unified solution for translators and researchers, enhancing workflow efficiency and data quality.

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) post-editing and research data collection often rely
on inefficient, disconnected workflows. We introduce TranslationCorrect, an
integrated framework designed to streamline these tasks. TranslationCorrect
combines MT generation using models like NLLB, automated error prediction using
models like XCOMET or LLM APIs (providing detailed reasoning), and an intuitive
post-editing interface within a single environment. Built with human-computer
interaction (HCI) principles in mind to minimize cognitive load, as confirmed
by a user study. For translators, it enables them to correct errors and batch
translate efficiently. For researchers, TranslationCorrect exports high-quality
span-based annotations in the Error Span Annotation (ESA) format, using an
error taxonomy inspired by Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM). These
outputs are compatible with state-of-the-art error detection models and
suitable for training MT or post-editing systems. Our user study confirms that
TranslationCorrect significantly improves translation efficiency and user
satisfaction over traditional annotation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper explores the challenges of test-time scaling of large language
models (LLMs), regarding both the data and inference efficiency. We highlight
the diversity of multi-lingual reasoning based on our pilot studies, and then
introduce a novel approach, \(L^2\) multi-lingual unification learning with a
decoding intervention strategy for further investigation. The basic idea of
\(L^2\) is that the reasoning process varies across different languages, which
may be mutually beneficial to enhance both model performance and efficiency. In
specific, there are two types of multi-lingual data: the entire long
chain-of-thought annotations in different languages and the step-wise mixture
of languages. By further tuning based on them, we show that even small amounts
of data can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. Our findings suggest
that multilingual learning reduces both the required data and the number of
inference tokens while maintaining a comparable performance. Furthermore,
\(L^2\) is orthogonal to other data efficient methods. Thus, we also emphasize
the importance of diverse data selection. The \(L^2\) method offers a promising
solution to the challenges of data collection and test-time compute efficiency
in LLMs.

TL;DR: GPT-Black outperforms other metrics in evaluating causal explanations in diagnostic reports, aligning well with expert assessments, while similarity-based metrics fall short.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine how accurately different evaluation metrics assess the quality of causal explanations in diagnostic reports, focusing on interpretability and clinical validity.

Method: Comparison of six metrics (BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec, GPT-White, GPT-Black, expert assessment) across two input types and two weighting strategies.

Result: GPT-Black shows the strongest discriminative power for coherent and clinically valid explanations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from expert evaluations.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation, particularly GPT-Black, is recommended for tasks requiring causal reasoning and interpretability, highlighting the importance of metric selection and weighting.

Abstract: This study investigates how accurately different evaluation metrics capture
the quality of causal explanations in automatically generated diagnostic
reports. We compare six metrics: BERTScore, Cosine Similarity, BioSentVec,
GPT-White, GPT-Black, and expert qualitative assessment across two input types:
observation-based and multiple-choice-based report generation. Two weighting
strategies are applied: one reflecting task-specific priorities, and the other
assigning equal weights to all metrics. Our results show that GPT-Black
demonstrates the strongest discriminative power in identifying logically
coherent and clinically valid causal narratives. GPT-White also aligns well
with expert evaluations, while similarity-based metrics diverge from clinical
reasoning quality. These findings emphasize the impact of metric selection and
weighting on evaluation outcomes, supporting the use of LLM-based evaluation
for tasks requiring interpretability and causal reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel lemmatization approaches for Arabic, framing it as classification into a Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, and presents a new test set. Character-level sequence models are competitive but limited, while classification and clustering methods set new benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lemmatization tools for Arabic face challenges due to inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage, necessitating more robust solutions.

Method: Two approaches frame lemmatization as classification into an LPG tagset, using machine translation and semantic clustering. A new test set is also introduced.

Result: Character-level sequence models perform competitively but are limited to lemma prediction and prone to errors. Classification and clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: The proposed classification and clustering methods set new benchmarks for Arabic lemmatization, outperforming sequence models in robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: Lemmatization is crucial for NLP tasks in morphologically rich languages with
ambiguous orthography like Arabic, but existing tools face challenges due to
inconsistent standards and limited genre coverage. This paper introduces two
novel approaches that frame lemmatization as classification into a
Lemma-POS-Gloss (LPG) tagset, leveraging machine translation and semantic
clustering. We also present a new Arabic lemmatization test set covering
diverse genres, standardized alongside existing datasets. We evaluate character
level sequence-to-sequence models, which perform competitively and offer
complementary value, but are limited to lemma prediction (not LPG) and prone to
hallucinating implausible forms. Our results show that classification and
clustering yield more robust, interpretable outputs, setting new benchmarks for
Arabic lemmatization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TReB, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on table reasoning tasks, covering 26 sub-tasks, and provides a dataset and framework for robust assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack effectiveness in evaluating LLMs' broad table reasoning abilities due to hidden semantics and complexity of structured data.

Method: Developed TReB with a high-quality dataset and an evaluation framework featuring three inference modes (TCoT, PoT, ICoT). Benchmarked 20+ LLMs.

Result: LLMs show significant room for improvement in handling complex, real-world table tasks.

Conclusion: TReB effectively measures table reasoning, highlighting gaps in LLM performance, and is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: The majority of data in businesses and industries is stored in tables,
databases, and data warehouses. Reasoning with table-structured data poses
significant challenges for large language models (LLMs) due to its hidden
semantics, inherent complexity, and structured nature. One of these challenges
is lacking an effective evaluation benchmark fairly reflecting the performances
of LLMs on broad table reasoning abilities. In this paper, we fill in this gap,
presenting a comprehensive table reasoning evolution benchmark, TReB, which
measures both shallow table understanding abilities and deep table reasoning
abilities, a total of 26 sub-tasks. We construct a high quality dataset through
an iterative data processing procedure. We create an evaluation framework to
robustly measure table reasoning capabilities with three distinct inference
modes, TCoT, PoT and ICoT. Further, we benchmark over 20 state-of-the-art LLMs
using this frame work and prove its effectiveness. Experimental results reveal
that existing LLMs still have significant room for improvement in addressing
the complex and real world Table related tasks. Both the dataset and evaluation
framework are publicly available, with the dataset hosted on [HuggingFace] and
the framework on [GitHub].

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeRF combines reinforcement learning with in-context learning to enhance LLMs' reasoning by injecting reward rules into prompts, improving performance on logic puzzles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods ignore LLMs' in-context learning ability, which is crucial for reasoning tasks like CoT prompting. MeRF aims to leverage this by integrating reward specifications into prompts.

Method: MeRF injects reward specifications into prompts as in-context motivation, aligning LLM generation with optimization objectives to improve reasoning.

Result: MeRF outperforms baselines on the K&K logic puzzle benchmark, with performance improving when motivation aligns with rewards. It also adapts to misleading motivations.

Conclusion: MeRF effectively combines reinforcement learning and in-context learning, demonstrating improved reasoning in LLMs and adaptability to reward alignment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle
complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR methods overlook one of the
most distinctive capabilities of LLMs, their in-context learning ability, as
prominently demonstrated by the success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.
This motivates us to explore how reinforcement learning can be effectively
combined with in-context learning to better improve the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement
Finetuning} (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement
learning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs the rules of the game''.
Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt,
which serves as an in-context motivation for model to improve its responses
with awareness of the optimization objective. This simple modification
leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs aligning generation with
optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from
both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations on the Knights
and Knaves~(K&K) logic puzzle reasoning benchmark demonstrate that
\texttt{MeRF} achieves substantial performance gains over baselines. Moreover,
ablation studies show that performance improves with greater consistency
between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the
model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through
reinforcement learning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates ChatGPT and DeepSeek across five NLP tasks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively assess the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and DeepSeek in diverse NLP applications.

Method: A structured experimental protocol with identical, neutral prompts and two benchmark datasets per task (sentiment analysis, topic classification, text summarization, machine translation, textual entailment).

Result: DeepSeek excels in classification stability and logical reasoning; ChatGPT performs better in nuanced understanding and flexibility.

Conclusion: The findings guide the selection of the appropriate LLM based on specific task requirements.

Abstract: The increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks has sparked significant interest in evaluating their
effectiveness across diverse applications. While models like ChatGPT and
DeepSeek have shown strong results in many NLP domains, a comprehensive
evaluation is needed to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and
domain-specific abilities. This is critical as these models are applied to
various tasks, from sentiment analysis to more nuanced tasks like textual
entailment and translation. This study aims to evaluate ChatGPT and DeepSeek
across five key NLP tasks: sentiment analysis, topic classification, text
summarization, machine translation, and textual entailment. A structured
experimental protocol is used to ensure fairness and minimize variability. Both
models are tested with identical, neutral prompts and evaluated on two
benchmark datasets per task, covering domains like news, reviews, and
formal/informal texts. The results show that DeepSeek excels in classification
stability and logical reasoning, while ChatGPT performs better in tasks
requiring nuanced understanding and flexibility. These findings provide
valuable insights for selecting the appropriate LLM based on task requirements.

*Mengjie Qian,Rao Ma,Stefano BannÃ²,Mark J. F. Gales,Kate M. Knill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores End-to-End (E2E) frameworks for Spoken Grammatical Error Correction (SGEC), addressing challenges like data scarcity and error propagation, and proposes solutions like pseudo-labeling and reference alignment to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGEC is crucial for L2 learners but faces challenges like disfluencies and transcription errors. Cascaded pipelines are error-prone, prompting the need for E2E solutions.

Method: The study compares cascaded, partial-cascaded, and E2E architectures using Whisper. It introduces pseudo-labeling to expand training data and reference alignment for precise feedback.

Result: Proposed methods significantly improve E2E SGEC performance on Linguaskill and Speak & Improve corpora.

Conclusion: E2E SGEC systems, enhanced with pseudo-labeling and alignment, offer promising solutions for accurate feedback in L2 learning.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and feedback play a vital role in
supporting second language (L2) learners, educators, and examiners. While
written GEC is well-established, spoken GEC (SGEC), aiming to provide feedback
based on learners' speech, poses additional challenges due to disfluencies,
transcription errors, and the lack of structured input. SGEC systems typically
follow a cascaded pipeline consisting of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),
disfluency detection, and GEC, making them vulnerable to error propagation
across modules. This work examines an End-to-End (E2E) framework for SGEC and
feedback generation, highlighting challenges and possible solutions when
developing these systems. Cascaded, partial-cascaded and E2E architectures are
compared, all built on the Whisper foundation model. A challenge for E2E
systems is the scarcity of GEC labeled spoken data. To address this, an
automatic pseudo-labeling framework is examined, increasing the training data
from 77 to over 2500 hours. To improve the accuracy of the SGEC system,
additional contextual information, exploiting the ASR output, is investigated.
Candidate feedback of their mistakes is an essential step to improving
performance. In E2E systems the SGEC output must be compared with an estimate
of the fluent transcription to obtain the feedback. To improve the precision of
this feedback, a novel reference alignment process is proposed that aims to
remove hypothesised edits that results from fluent transcription errors.
Finally, these approaches are combined with an edit confidence estimation
approach, to exclude low-confidence edits. Experiments on the in-house
Linguaskill (LNG) corpora and the publicly available Speak & Improve (S&I)
corpus show that the proposed approaches significantly boost E2E SGEC
performance.

*Manu Pande,Shahil Kumar,Anay Yatin Damle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage ranking task, underperforming the base model due to disrupted embedding space structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why fine-tuning pre-trained models worsens performance on the MS MARCO task, contrary to expectations.

Method: Conducted experiments with five model variants, including full fine-tuning and LoRA adaptations, analyzed embedding space via UMAP, and evaluated training dynamics.

Result: All fine-tuning approaches underperformed the base model (MRR@10: 0.3026), with fine-tuning disrupting the optimal embedding space.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning may not always improve performance on saturated benchmarks, suggesting a need for architectural innovations.

Abstract: This paper investigates the counterintuitive phenomenon where fine-tuning
pre-trained transformer models degrades performance on the MS MARCO passage
ranking task. Through comprehensive experiments involving five model
variants-including full parameter fine-tuning and parameter efficient LoRA
adaptations-we demonstrate that all fine-tuning approaches underperform the
base sentence-transformers/all- MiniLM-L6-v2 model (MRR@10: 0.3026). Our
analysis reveals that fine-tuning disrupts the optimal embedding space
structure learned during the base model's extensive pre-training on 1 billion
sentence pairs, including 9.1 million MS MARCO samples. UMAP visualizations
show progressive embedding space flattening, while training dynamics analysis
and computational efficiency metrics further support our findings. These
results challenge conventional wisdom about transfer learning effectiveness on
saturated benchmarks and suggest architectural innovations may be necessary for
meaningful improvements.

*Matteo Melis,Gabriella Lapesa,Dennis Assenmacher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how varying definitions of hate speech impact NLP model performance, organizing definitions into a taxonomy and testing three LLMs on different datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in hate speech definitions and assess their impact on model performance.

Method: Collect and analyze hate speech definitions, create a taxonomy, and evaluate three LLMs in zero-shot settings across three datasets.

Result: Model performance varies with definition specificity, but effects are inconsistent across architectures.

Conclusion: Definition specificity affects hate speech detection, but model architecture plays a significant role in performance.

Abstract: Detecting harmful content is a crucial task in the landscape of NLP
applications for Social Good, with hate speech being one of its most dangerous
forms. But what do we mean by hate speech, how can we define it, and how does
prompting different definitions of hate speech affect model performance? The
contribution of this work is twofold. At the theoretical level, we address the
ambiguity surrounding hate speech by collecting and analyzing existing
definitions from the literature. We organize these definitions into a taxonomy
of 14 Conceptual Elements-building blocks that capture different aspects of
hate speech definitions, such as references to the target of hate (individual
or groups) or of the potential consequences of it. At the experimental level,
we employ the collection of definitions in a systematic zero-shot evaluation of
three LLMs, on three hate speech datasets representing different types of data
(synthetic, human-in-the-loop, and real-world). We find that choosing different
definitions, i.e., definitions with a different degree of specificity in terms
of encoded elements, impacts model performance, but this effect is not
consistent across all architectures.

*Haoyi Wu,Zhihao Teng,Kewei Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PCCoT improves continuous CoT by parallelizing latent thought token updates, saving 50% time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequential dependencies in continuous CoT slow training; PCCoT aims to parallelize updates for efficiency.

Method: Uses Jacobi iteration to update latent thought tokens in parallel, reducing sequential dependencies.

Result: Achieves comparable/better performance with 50% faster training/inference; improved stability.

Conclusion: PCCoT efficiently parallelizes continuous CoT, offering significant time savings and robustness.

Abstract: Continuous chain-of-thought has been shown to be effective in saving
reasoning tokens for large language models. By reasoning with continuous latent
thought tokens, continuous CoT is able to perform implicit reasoning in a
compact manner. However, the sequential dependencies between latent thought
tokens spoil parallel training, leading to long training time. In this paper,
we propose Parallel Continuous Chain-of-Thought (PCCoT), which performs Jacobi
iteration on the latent thought tokens, updating them iteratively in parallel
instead of sequentially and thus improving both training and inference
efficiency of continuous CoT. Experiments demonstrate that by choosing the
proper number of iterations, we are able to achieve comparable or even better
performance while saving nearly 50% of the training and inference time.
Moreover, PCCoT shows better stability and robustness in the training process.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses concerns about data contamination in LLM simulations but argues that emergent dynamics can still be studied, as shown in social conventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify that despite data contamination risks, genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations can be studied.

Method: Analyzes critiques and empirical observations of LLM behavior, focusing on social conventions.

Result: Demonstrates that self-organization and emergent dynamics are observable in LLM populations.

Conclusion: Data contamination does not prevent the study of emergent phenomena in LLMs, as evidenced by social conventions.

Abstract: A potential concern when simulating populations of large language models
(LLMs) is data contamination, i.e. the possibility that training data may shape
outcomes in unintended ways. While this concern is important and may hinder
certain experiments with multi-agent models, it does not preclude the study of
genuinely emergent dynamics in LLM populations. The recent critique by Barrie
and T\"ornberg [1] of the results of Flint Ashery et al. [2] offers an
opportunity to clarify that self-organisation and model-dependent emergent
dynamics can be studied in LLM populations, highlighting how such dynamics have
been empirically observed in the specific case of social conventions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates semantic similarity estimation using USE, InferSent, and BERT, finding BERT outperforms others, especially on domain-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic similarity estimation is crucial for NLP tasks like question answering and machine translation.

Method: Compared USE, InferSent, and BERT on in-house and Quora question pairs datasets.

Result: BERT showed superior performance, attributed to its fine-tuning capability.

Conclusion: BERT is the best choice for domain-specific semantic similarity tasks.

Abstract: Estimation of semantic similarity is an important research problem both in
natural language processing and the natural language understanding, and that
has tremendous application on various downstream tasks such as question
answering, semantic search, information retrieval, document clustering,
word-sense disambiguation and machine translation. In this work, we carry out
the estimation of semantic similarity using different state-of-the-art
techniques including the USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), InferSent and the
most recent BERT, or Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers,
models. We use two question pairs datasets for the analysis, one is a domain
specific in-house dataset and the other is a public dataset which is the
Quora's question pairs dataset. We observe that the BERT model gave much
superior performance as compared to the other methods. This should be because
of the fine-tuning procedure that is involved in its training process, allowing
it to learn patterns based on the training data that is used. This works
demonstrates the applicability of BERT on domain specific datasets. We infer
from the analysis that BERT is the best technique to use in the case of domain
specific data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores GPT-4o's understanding of persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying PhD speech transcripts, revealing systematic stylistic changes over human-like optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze how large language models like GPT-4o interpret and manipulate persuasiveness in public speaking.

Method: Modified speech transcripts from the 3MT French dataset, prompting GPT-4o to enhance/diminish persuasiveness, and analyzed linguistic shifts using rhetorical and discourse features.

Result: GPT-4o applies stylistic changes (e.g., emotional lexicon, syntactic structures) to amplify rhetorical impact, not human-like persuasiveness.

Conclusion: GPT-4o systematically modifies style for rhetorical effect, lacking human-like persuasiveness optimization.

Abstract: This study examines how large language models understand the concept of
persuasiveness in public speaking by modifying speech transcripts from PhD
candidates in the "Ma These en 180 Secondes" competition, using the 3MT French
dataset. Our contributions include a novel methodology and an interpretable
textual feature set integrating rhetorical devices and discourse markers. We
prompt GPT-4o to enhance or diminish persuasiveness and analyze linguistic
shifts between original and generated speech in terms of the new features.
Results indicate that GPT-4o applies systematic stylistic modifications rather
than optimizing persuasiveness in a human-like manner. Notably, it manipulates
emotional lexicon and syntactic structures (such as interrogative and
exclamatory clauses) to amplify rhetorical impact.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ByteSpan, a new subword tokeniser, groups predictable byte sequences using an external byte-level LM, outperforming BPE in morphological alignment for English and showing efficiency in multilingual settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores whether grouping predictable bytes, inspired by computational models of word segmentation, can create a useful fixed subword vocabulary.

Method: Proposes ByteSpan, which uses an external byte-level LM to identify and group predictable byte sequences into subwords.

Result: ByteSpan achieves higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English and shows similar compression and efficiency for 25 languages.

Conclusion: ByteSpan is an effective, information-driven tokeniser that improves upon existing methods like BPE.

Abstract: Recent dynamic tokenisation methods operate directly on bytes and pool their
latent representations into patches. This bears similarities to computational
models of word segmentation that determine lexical boundaries using spikes in
an autoregressive model's prediction error. Inspired by this connection, we
explore whether grouping predictable bytes - rather than pooling their
representations - can yield a useful fixed subword vocabulary. We propose a new
information-driven subword tokeniser, ByteSpan, that uses an external
byte-level LM during training to identify contiguous predictable byte sequences
and group them into subwords. Experiments show that ByteSpan yields efficient
vocabularies with higher morphological alignment scores than BPE for English.
Multilingual experiments show similar compression and R\'enyi efficiency for 25
languages.

*Raquel Ferrando,Javier Conde,Gonzalo MartÃ­nez,Pedro Reviriego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Optimizing tokenizers for chatbot conversations can reduce token counts by 5-10%, saving energy with minimal impact on original corpus efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational and energy costs of LLMs are high, and tokenizers optimized for training corpora may not perform well in chatbot interactions, prompting exploration of domain-specific optimization.

Method: Redesign tokenizer vocabularies using a chatbot conversation corpus and evaluate performance in this domain.

Result: Conversation-optimized tokenizers reduce tokens in dialogues by 5-10%, leading to energy savings without harming original corpus efficiency.

Conclusion: Domain-specific tokenizer optimization for chatbots is beneficial, offering energy savings and maintaining performance.

Abstract: The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive
adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is
the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in
the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the
number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular
applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation
is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the
tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most
likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that
immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing
tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for
different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot
conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in
this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers
consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead
to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or
even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original
training corpus.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for correcting substitution errors in neural sequence-to-sequence speech recognition systems improves accuracy for challenging words like named entities and acronyms, achieving up to 11% relative improvement in biased word error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural sequence-to-sequence systems struggle with recognizing unseen or challenging words (e.g., named entities, acronyms) due to pronunciation-orthography mismatches.

Method: Proposes a correction method allowing users to add corrections during inference to address substitution errors.

Result: Achieves up to 11% relative improvement in biased word error rate while maintaining competitive overall word error rate.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances recognition accuracy for challenging words without degrading overall performance.

Abstract: Neural sequence-to-sequence systems deliver state-of-the-art performance for
automatic speech recognition. When using appropriate modeling units, e.g.,
byte-pair encoded characters, these systems are in principal open vocabulary
systems. In practice, however, they often fail to recognize words not seen
during training, e.g., named entities, acronyms, or domain-specific special
words. To address this problem, many context biasing methods have been
proposed; however, for words with a pronunciation-orthography mismatch, these
methods may still struggle. We propose a method which allows corrections of
substitution errors to improve the recognition accuracy of such challenging
words. Users can add corrections on the fly during inference. We show that with
this method we get a relative improvement in biased word error rate of up to
11\%, while maintaining a competitive overall word error rate.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus on content knowledge, neglecting pedagogical understanding, which is critical for AI's role in education.

Method: The benchmark uses questions from professional teacher exams, covering pedagogical subdomains like teaching strategies and assessment methods. Results for 97 models are analyzed.

Result: Model accuracies range from 28% to 89%. The paper examines cost-accuracy trade-offs and updates an online leaderboard for model comparison.

Conclusion: Pedagogical benchmarks are essential for responsible AI deployment in education, guiding development and policy decisions.

Abstract: Benchmarks like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) have played a
pivotal role in evaluating AI's knowledge and abilities across diverse domains.
However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on content knowledge, leaving
a critical gap in assessing models' understanding of pedagogy - the method and
practice of teaching. This paper introduces The Pedagogy Benchmark, a novel
dataset designed to evaluate large language models on their Cross-Domain
Pedagogical Knowledge (CDPK) and Special Education Needs and Disability (SEND)
pedagogical knowledge. These benchmarks are built on a carefully curated set of
questions sourced from professional development exams for teachers, which cover
a range of pedagogical subdomains such as teaching strategies and assessment
methods. Here we outline the methodology and development of these benchmarks.
We report results for 97 models, with accuracies spanning a range from 28% to
89% on the pedagogical knowledge questions. We consider the relationship
between cost and accuracy and chart the progression of the Pareto value
frontier over time. We provide online leaderboards at
https://rebrand.ly/pedagogy which are updated with new models and allow
interactive exploration and filtering based on various model properties, such
as cost per token and open-vs-closed weights, as well as looking at performance
in different subjects. LLMs and generative AI have tremendous potential to
influence education and help to address the global learning crisis.
Education-focused benchmarks are crucial to measure models' capacities to
understand pedagogical concepts, respond appropriately to learners' needs, and
support effective teaching practices across diverse contexts. They are needed
for informing the responsible and evidence-based deployment of LLMs and
LLM-based tools in educational settings, and for guiding both development and
policy decisions.

TL;DR: AGBS method improves prompt optimization in LLMs by balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unintended misinterpretations in automated prompt engineering for LLMs.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) to simulate prompt optimization while preserving semantics.

Result: AGBS effectively balances semantic consistency and attack efficacy in experiments.

Conclusion: AGBS offers insights for designing reliable prompt optimization systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on automatic prompt
engineering in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to refine user inputs and
enhance response accuracy. However, the diversity of user requirements often
leads to unintended misinterpretations, where automated optimizations distort
original intentions and produce erroneous outputs. To address this challenge,
we propose the Adaptive Greedy Binary Search (AGBS) method, which simulates
common prompt optimization mechanisms while preserving semantic stability. Our
approach dynamically evaluates the impact of such strategies on LLM
performance, enabling robust adversarial sample generation. Through extensive
experiments on open and closed-source LLMs, we demonstrate AGBS's effectiveness
in balancing semantic consistency and attack efficacy. Our findings offer
actionable insights for designing more reliable prompt optimization systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASP2LJ, a framework combining adversarial self-play and case generation to improve Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) by addressing long-tail data and lawyer argumentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LJP faces challenges like imbalanced datasets and neglected lawyer roles, limiting judicial accuracy.

Method: Proposes ASP2LJ with case generation for long-tail data and adversarial self-play to enhance lawyer arguments.

Result: Improves judicial decision fairness and rationality, validated on SimuCourt and RareCases datasets.

Conclusion: ASP2LJ advances LJP with a novel framework, rare-case dataset, and open resources for future research.

Abstract: Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including
relevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large
Language Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail
Distribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high
human annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model
performance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on
enhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in
refining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment
Framework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle
long-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to
enhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to
reference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and
rationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a
dataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our
RareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,
indicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,
a rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support
further research in automated judicial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure LLMs are transparent and trustworthy by addressing self-consistency issues in their reasoning.

Method: Introduces inconsistency metrics and two automated methods (graph-based and energy-based) to mitigate inconsistencies.

Result: Smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully self-consistent. Partial improvements are achieved with proposed methods.

Conclusion: Self-consistency is complex but crucial for reliable and interpretable AI. The study provides tools and insights for future work.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have grown increasingly powerful, yet ensuring
their decisions remain transparent and trustworthy requires self-consistency --
no contradictions in their internal reasoning. Our study reveals that even on
simple tasks, such as comparing points on a line or a plane, or reasoning in a
family tree, all smaller models are highly inconsistent, and even
state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-o4-mini are not fully
self-consistent. To quantify and mitigate these inconsistencies, we introduce
inconsistency metrics and propose two automated methods -- a graph-based and an
energy-based approach. While these fixes provide partial improvements, they
also highlight the complexity and importance of self-consistency in building
more reliable and interpretable AI. The code and data are available at

Method: RWESummary includes one scenario and three evaluations, developed using proprietary data, and compares LLM performance.

Result: Gemini 2.5 models (Flash and Pro) performed best on 13 RWE studies.

Conclusion: RWESummary is a useful benchmark for RWE study summarization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated for general
summarization tasks as well as medical research assistance, but they have not
been specifically evaluated for the task of summarizing real-world evidence
(RWE) from structured output of RWE studies. We introduce RWESummary, a
proposed addition to the MedHELM framework (Bedi, Cui, Fuentes, Unell et al.,
2025) to enable benchmarking of LLMs for this task. RWESummary includes one
scenario and three evaluations covering major types of errors observed in
summarization of medical research studies and was developed using Atropos
Health proprietary data. Additionally, we use RWESummary to compare the
performance of different LLMs in our internal RWE summarization tool. At the
time of publication, with 13 distinct RWE studies, we found the Gemini 2.5
models performed best overall (both Flash and Pro). We suggest RWESummary as a
novel and useful foundation model benchmark for real-world evidence study
summarization.

TL;DR: The paper presents a modular cascade system for real-time speech translation, combining Whisper for ASR and NLLB for MT, achieving a balance between quality and latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of real-time translation of long-form speech by leveraging pre-trained models without extensive retraining.

Method: Uses Whisper Large-V3-Turbo for ASR and NLLB-3.3B for MT, with lightweight adaptation techniques like prefix training and adaptive emission policies (wait-$k$ and RALCP).

Result: Achieved a BLEU score of 31.96 on ACL60/60 and 29.8 on IWSLT25Instruct, with a latency of 2.94 seconds.

Conclusion: Pre-trained models with careful adaptation can effectively handle simultaneous translation for long-form content without needing extensive parallel data or end-to-end training.

Abstract: This work describes the participation of the MLLP-VRAIN research group in the
shared task of the IWSLT 2025 Simultaneous Speech Translation track. Our
submission addresses the unique challenges of real-time translation of
long-form speech by developing a modular cascade system that adapts strong
pre-trained models to streaming scenarios. We combine Whisper Large-V3-Turbo
for ASR with the multilingual NLLB-3.3B model for MT, implementing lightweight
adaptation techniques rather than training new end-to-end models from scratch.
Our approach employs document-level adaptation with prefix training to enhance
the MT model's ability to handle incomplete inputs, while incorporating
adaptive emission policies including a wait-$k$ strategy and RALCP for managing
the translation stream. Specialized buffer management techniques and
segmentation strategies ensure coherent translations across long audio
sequences. Experimental results on the ACL60/60 dataset demonstrate that our
system achieves a favorable balance between translation quality and latency,
with a BLEU score of 31.96 and non-computational-aware StreamLAAL latency of
2.94 seconds. Our final model achieves a preliminary score on the official test
set (IWSLT25Instruct) of 29.8 BLEU. Our work demonstrates that carefully
adapted pre-trained components can create effective simultaneous translation
systems for long-form content without requiring extensive in-domain parallel
data or specialized end-to-end training.

*Aryasomayajula Ram Bharadwaj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STUPID dynamically adjusts reasoning steps in large language models using a PID controller, improving accuracy by 6% and reducing token usage by 32%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overthinking problem in extended chain-of-thought reasoning, which leads to redundant steps and higher computational costs.

Method: Proposes STUPID, a training-free method using a PID controller and chunk-level classifier to dynamically modulate activation steering strength during inference.

Result: Achieves a 6% accuracy improvement and 32% reduction in token usage on GSM8K, outperforming static steering methods.

Conclusion: STUPID offers a principled, dynamic approach to maintain reasoning quality while enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models employing extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
often suffer from the overthinking phenomenon, generating excessive and
redundant reasoning steps that increase computational costs while potentially
degrading performance. While recent work has explored static steering
approaches to mitigate this issue, they lack the adaptability to dynamically
adjust intervention strength based on real-time reasoning quality. We propose
STUPID (Steering Token Usage via PID controller), a novel training-free method
that employs a PID controller to dynamically modulate activation steering
strength during inference. Our approach combines a chunk-level classifier for
detecting redundant reasoning patterns with a PID control mechanism that
adaptively adjusts steering intensity based on the predicted redundancy
probability. Experimental evaluation on GSM8K demonstrates that STUPID achieves
a 6% improvement in accuracy while reducing token usage by 32%, outperforming
static steering baselines. Our method provides a principled framework for
dynamic reasoning calibration that maintains reasoning quality while
significantly improving computational efficiency.

*Yuhao Wu,Yushi Bai,Zhiqiang Hu,Roy Ka-Wei Lee,Juanzi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an incentivization-based approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to enable ultra-long, high-quality text generation in LLMs without relying on synthetic data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating ultra-long text with LLMs due to length limits and quality degradation, and the limitations of synthetic data-dependent approaches like LongWriter.

Method: Proposes RL training from a base model (Qwen2.5-32B) with specialized reward models for length control, quality, and formatting, avoiding synthetic data.

Result: LongWriter-Zero outperforms SFT methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks like WritingBench and Arena-Write, even surpassing larger models.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach is effective for ultra-long text generation, offering superior performance without synthetic data dependency.

Abstract: Ultra-long generation by large language models (LLMs) is a widely demanded
scenario, yet it remains a significant challenge due to their maximum
generation length limit and overall quality degradation as sequence length
increases. Previous approaches, exemplified by LongWriter, typically rely on
''teaching'', which involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic
long-form outputs. However, this strategy heavily depends on synthetic SFT
data, which is difficult and costly to construct, often lacks coherence and
consistency, and tends to be overly artificial and structurally monotonous. In
this work, we propose an incentivization-based approach that, starting entirely
from scratch and without relying on any annotated or synthetic data, leverages
reinforcement learning (RL) to foster the emergence of ultra-long, high-quality
text generation capabilities in LLMs. We perform RL training starting from a
base model, similar to R1-Zero, guiding it to engage in reasoning that
facilitates planning and refinement during the writing process. To support
this, we employ specialized reward models that steer the LLM towards improved
length control, writing quality, and structural formatting. Experimental
evaluations show that our LongWriter-Zero model, trained from Qwen2.5-32B,
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods on long-form writing tasks,
achieving state-of-the-art results across all metrics on WritingBench and
Arena-Write, and even surpassing 100B+ models such as DeepSeek R1 and
Qwen3-235B. We open-source our data and model checkpoints under

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the need for philosophy in MI to address assumptions, concepts, and explanatory strategies, ensuring robust and ethically sound research.

Method: Analyzes three open problems in MI literature to demonstrate how philosophical inquiry can enhance the field.

Result: Philosophy can significantly contribute to MI by refining methods, clarifying concepts, and addressing ethical implications.

Conclusion: Interdisciplinary collaboration between MI and philosophy is essential for advancing the field and ensuring its epistemic and ethical integrity.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to explain how neural networks work by
uncovering their underlying causal mechanisms. As the field grows in influence,
it is increasingly important to examine not just models themselves, but the
assumptions, concepts and explanatory strategies implicit in MI research. We
argue that mechanistic interpretability needs philosophy: not as an
afterthought, but as an ongoing partner in clarifying its concepts, refining
its methods, and assessing the epistemic and ethical stakes of interpreting AI
systems. Taking three open problems from the MI literature as examples, this
position paper illustrates the value philosophy can add to MI research, and
outlines a path toward deeper interdisciplinary dialogue.

TL;DR: CommVQ reduces KV cache memory usage in LLMs by 87.5% with 2-bit quantization, enabling long-context inference on GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The KV cache in LLMs becomes a memory bottleneck for long-context applications, limiting GPU efficiency.

Method: Proposes Commutative Vector Quantization (CommVQ) with additive quantization, a lightweight encoder, and a RoPE-commutative codebook trained via EM.

Result: Achieves high accuracy with 2-bit quantization, outperforming SOTA methods, and enables 1-bit quantization with minimal loss.

Conclusion: CommVQ efficiently reduces memory usage, enabling long-context LLM inference on GPUs like the LLaMA-3.1 8B model with 128K context on an RTX 4090.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications requiring
long context lengths, but the key-value (KV) cache often becomes a memory
bottleneck on GPUs as context grows. To address this, we propose Commutative
Vector Quantization (CommVQ) to significantly reduce memory usage for
long-context LLM inference. We first introduce additive quantization with a
lightweight encoder and codebook to compress the KV cache, which can be decoded
via simple matrix multiplication. To further reduce computational costs during
decoding, we design the codebook to be commutative with Rotary Position
Embedding (RoPE) and train it using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
This enables efficient integration of decoding into the self-attention
mechanism. Our approach achieves high accuracy with additive quantization and
low overhead via the RoPE-commutative codebook. Experiments on long-context
benchmarks and GSM8K show that our method reduces FP16 KV cache size by 87.5%
with 2-bit quantization, while outperforming state-of-the-art KV cache
quantization methods. Notably, it enables 1-bit KV cache quantization with
minimal accuracy loss, allowing a LLaMA-3.1 8B model to run with a 128K context
length on a single RTX 4090 GPU. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OMEGA benchmark evaluates LLMs' out-of-distribution generalization in math, revealing limitations in exploratory, compositional, and transformative reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' reliance on narrow strategies and struggles with novel problem-solving in math.

Method: Introduces OMEGA, a benchmark with programmatically generated problems across math domains, evaluating three generalization axes.

Result: Frontier LLMs show sharp performance drops with complexity; fine-tuning improves exploratory but not compositional or transformative reasoning.

Conclusion: OMEGA identifies LLMs' limitations, paving the way for advancing mathematical creativity beyond mechanical proficiency.

Abstract: Recent large-scale language models (LLMs) with long Chain-of-Thought
reasoning-such as DeepSeek-R1-have achieved impressive results on
Olympiad-level mathematics benchmarks. However, they often rely on a narrow set
of strategies and struggle with problems that require a novel way of thinking.
To systematically investigate these limitations, we introduce
OMEGA-Out-of-distribution Math Problems Evaluation with 3 Generalization Axes-a
controlled yet diverse benchmark designed to evaluate three axes of
out-of-distribution generalization, inspired by Boden's typology of creativity:
(1) Exploratory-applying known problem solving skills to more complex instances
within the same problem domain; (2) Compositional-combining distinct reasoning
skills, previously learned in isolation, to solve novel problems that require
integrating these skills in new and coherent ways; and (3)
Transformative-adopting novel, often unconventional strategies by moving beyond
familiar approaches to solve problems more effectively. OMEGA consists of
programmatically generated training-test pairs derived from templated problem
generators across geometry, number theory, algebra, combinatorics, logic, and
puzzles, with solutions verified using symbolic, numerical, or graphical
methods. We evaluate frontier (or top-tier) LLMs and observe sharp performance
degradation as problem complexity increases. Moreover, we fine-tune the
Qwen-series models across all generalization settings and observe notable
improvements in exploratory generalization, while compositional generalization
remains limited and transformative reasoning shows little to no improvement. By
isolating and quantifying these fine-grained failures, OMEGA lays the
groundwork for advancing LLMs toward genuine mathematical creativity beyond
mechanical proficiency.

TL;DR: ReasonFlux-PRM is a trajectory-aware Process Reward Model for evaluating reasoning traces in LLMs, outperforming existing PRMs and human baselines in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs struggle to robustly evaluate intermediate reasoning steps, especially in trajectory-response outputs from advanced models like Deepseek-R1.

Method: ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates step-level and trajectory-level supervision for fine-grained reward assignment, supporting offline and online settings like data distillation and reinforcement learning.

Result: ReasonFlux-PRM-7B outperforms strong PRMs and human baselines, achieving gains of 12.1% in fine-tuning, 4.5% in RL, and 6.3% in test-time scaling.

Conclusion: ReasonFlux-PRM is effective for evaluating reasoning traces and improves performance across various applications, with a lightweight version available for resource-constrained use.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for supervising intermediate reasoning steps in large language models (LLMs).
Previous PRMs are primarily trained on model final output responses and
struggle to evaluate intermediate thinking trajectories robustly, especially in
the emerging setting of trajectory-response outputs generated by frontier
reasoning models like Deepseek-R1. In this work, we introduce ReasonFlux-PRM, a
novel trajectory-aware PRM explicitly designed to evaluate the
trajectory-response type of reasoning traces. ReasonFlux-PRM incorporates both
step-level and trajectory-level supervision, enabling fine-grained reward
assignment aligned with structured chain-of-thought data. We adapt
ReasonFlux-PRM to support reward supervision under both offline and online
settings, including (i) selecting high-quality model distillation data for
downstream supervised fine-tuning of smaller models, (ii) providing dense
process-level rewards for policy optimization during reinforcement learning,
and (iii) enabling reward-guided Best-of-N test-time scaling. Empirical results
on challenging downstream benchmarks such as AIME, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond
demonstrate that ReasonFlux-PRM-7B selects higher quality data than strong PRMs
(e.g., Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B) and human-curated baselines. Furthermore, our
derived ReasonFlux-PRM-7B yields consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 12.1% in supervised fine-tuning, 4.5% in reinforcement
learning, and 6.3% in test-time scaling. We also release our efficient
ReasonFlux-PRM-1.5B for resource-constrained applications and edge deployment.

*Yichen Luo,Jia Wang,Dapeng Lan,Yu Liu,Zhibo Pang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMET is a novel framework using transformers to solve multi-input, multi-scale PDEs efficiently, outperforming SOTA methods in accuracy and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in solving PDEs with machine learning, such as limited generalization and high computational costs.

Method: MMET decouples mesh and query points into sequences, uses GCE for embedding, and employs Hilbert curve reserialization to reduce input length.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in accuracy and efficiency across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMET is a scalable solution for real-time PDE solving, with potential for future domain-specific pre-trained models.

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling physical
systems, yet solving them in a generic and efficient manner using machine
learning-based approaches remains challenging due to limited multi-input and
multi-scale generalization capabilities, as well as high computational costs.
This paper proposes the Multi-input and Multi-scale Efficient Transformer
(MMET), a novel framework designed to address the above challenges. MMET
decouples mesh and query points as two sequences and feeds them into the
encoder and decoder, respectively, and uses a Gated Condition Embedding (GCE)
layer to embed input variables or functions with varying dimensions, enabling
effective solutions for multi-scale and multi-input problems. Additionally, a
Hilbert curve-based reserialization and patch embedding mechanism decrease the
input length. This significantly reduces the computational cost when dealing
with large-scale geometric models. These innovations enable efficient
representations and support multi-scale resolution queries for large-scale and
multi-input PDE problems. Experimental evaluations on diverse benchmarks
spanning different physical fields demonstrate that MMET outperforms SOTA
methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This work highlights the
potential of MMET as a robust and scalable solution for real-time PDE solving
in engineering and physics-based applications, paving the way for future
explorations into pre-trained large-scale models in specific domains. This work

TL;DR: The paper addresses foreground object mismatch in Vision Transformer-based UDA by proposing PCaM, a Progressive Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism, which enhances attention consistency and domain alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDA methods using ViTs suffer from foreground object mismatch, weakening attention consistency and domain alignment.

Method: Proposes PCaM to filter background information progressively and an attentional guidance loss to focus on task-relevant regions.

Result: PCaM improves adaptation performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: PCaM effectively addresses foreground mismatch, enhancing domain adaptation in ViT-based UDA.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recent UDA methods based
on Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance through
attention-based feature alignment. However, we identify a key limitation:
foreground object mismatch, where the discrepancy in foreground object size and
spatial distribution across domains weakens attention consistency and hampers
effective domain alignment. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive
Focus Cross-Attention Mechanism (PCaM), which progressively filters out
background information during cross-attention, allowing the model to focus on
and fuse discriminative foreground semantics across domains. We further
introduce an attentional guidance loss that explicitly directs attention toward
task-relevant regions, enhancing cross-domain attention consistency. PCaM is
lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and easy to integrate into existing
ViT-based UDA pipelines. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, DomainNet,
VisDA-2017, and remote sensing datasets demonstrate that PCaM significantly
improves adaptation performance and achieves new state-of-the-art results,
validating the effectiveness of attention-guided foreground fusion for domain
adaptation.

Motivation: To explore if reasoning models generalize beyond math/programming/logic into chemistry, and to test their data efficiency.

Method: Post-trained Mistral-Small-24B with reinforcement learning on 640,730 chemistry problems across 375 tasks.

Result: ether0 outperforms general-purpose models, specialized models, and human experts in molecular design tasks.

Conclusion: Reasoning models can be adapted for scientific domains like chemistry efficiently, suggesting broader applicability.

Abstract: Reasoning models are large language models that emit a long chain-of-thought
before answering, providing both higher accuracy and explicit reasoning for
their response. A major question has been whether language model reasoning
generalizes beyond mathematics, programming, and logic, where most previous
work has focused. We demonstrate that reasoning models can be post-trained for
chemistry without additional domain pretraining, and require substantially less
data compared to contemporary domain-specific models. We report ether0, a 24B
parameter LLM (based on Mistral-Small-24B) that can reason in natural language
and respond with chemical structures. This reasoning model was trained with
reinforcement learning on 640,730 experimentally-grounded chemistry problems
across 375 tasks ranging from synthesizability, to blood-brain barrier
permeability, to human receptor activity, to scent. Our model exceeds
general-purpose chemistry models, frontier models, and human experts on
molecular design tasks. It is also more data efficient relative to specialized
models. We anticipate that this method can be applied to train data-efficient
language models specialized for tasks across a wide variety of scientific
domains.

TL;DR: MLBuf-RePlAce is a learning-driven buffering-aware global placement framework that improves timing closure without degrading power, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of traditional buffering approaches (computational expense) and machine learning methods (lack of ERC violation consideration) in physical design flows.

Method: Uses a recursive learning-based generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, integrated into the OpenROAD infrastructure.

Result: Achieves significant improvements in total negative slack (TNS) (up to 56%) without degrading post-route power, validated in both open-source and commercial flows.

Conclusion: MLBuf-RePlAce effectively closes the loop in physical design flows, offering a scalable and efficient solution for timing-driven placement.

Abstract: Due to the skewed scaling of interconnect versus cell delay in modern
technology nodes, placement with buffer porosity (i.e., cell density) awareness
is essential for timing closure in physical synthesis flows. However, existing
approaches face two key challenges: (i) traditional van Ginneken-Lillis-style
buffering approaches are computationally expensive during global placement; and
(ii) machine learning-based approaches, such as BufFormer, lack a thorough
consideration of Electrical Rule Check (ERC) violations and fail to "close the
loop" back into the physical design flow. In this work, we propose
MLBuf-RePlAce, the first open-source learning-driven virtual buffering-aware
analytical global placement framework, built on top of the OpenROAD
infrastructure. MLBuf-RePlAce adopts an efficient recursive learning-based
generative buffering approach to predict buffer types and locations, addressing
ERC violations during global placement. We compare MLBuf-RePlAce against the
default virtual buffering-based timing-driven global placer in OpenROAD, using
open-source testcases from the TILOS MacroPlacement and OpenROAD-flow-scripts
repositories. Without degradation of post-route power, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves
(maximum, average) improvements of (56%, 31%) in total negative slack (TNS)
within the open-source OpenROAD flow. When evaluated by completion in a
commercial flow, MLBuf-RePlAce achieves (maximum, average) improvements of
(53%, 28%) in TNS with an average of 0.2% improvement in post-route power.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the LSMI estimator for quantifying sample-wise multimodal interactions (redundancy, uniqueness, synergy) using pointwise information theory, validated by experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding multimodal interactions is key for analyzing information dynamics, but accurate quantification is challenging.

Method: Develops a redundancy estimation framework and general interaction method using efficient entropy estimation for continuous distributions.

Result: LSMI shows precision and efficiency in experiments, revealing fine-grained dynamics for practical applications.

Conclusion: LSMI enables practical uses like sample partitioning and model ensembling, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Interactions between modalities -- redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy --
collectively determine the composition of multimodal information. Understanding
these interactions is crucial for analyzing information dynamics in multimodal
systems, yet their accurate sample-level quantification presents significant
theoretical and computational challenges. To address this, we introduce the
Lightweight Sample-wise Multimodal Interaction (LSMI) estimator, rigorously
grounded in pointwise information theory. We first develop a redundancy
estimation framework, employing an appropriate pointwise information measure to
quantify this most decomposable and measurable interaction. Building upon this,
we propose a general interaction estimation method that employs efficient
entropy estimation, specifically tailored for sample-wise estimation in
continuous distributions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets validate LSMI's precision and efficiency. Crucially, our sample-wise
approach reveals fine-grained sample- and category-level dynamics within
multimodal data, enabling practical applications such as redundancy-informed
sample partitioning, targeted knowledge distillation, and interaction-aware
model ensembling. The code is available at

### [317] [Improving Prediction Certainty Estimation for Reliable Early Exiting via Null Space Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17249)
*Jianing He,Qi Zhang,Duoqian Miao,Yi Kun,Shufeng Hao,Hongyun Zhang,Zhihua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel early exiting method for pre-trained language models (PLMs) using a Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which improves prediction certainty estimation by integrating logits and a new NSP score, achieving faster inference with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing early exiting methods rely on class-relevant logits, ignoring class-irrelevant information, leading to premature exits and incorrect predictions.

Method: Introduces an NSP score to measure class-irrelevant information and combines it with logits in the CAP score for better certainty estimation.

Result: Achieves a 2.19x speed-up on GLUE tasks with negligible performance drop, outperforming SOTA by 28%.

Conclusion: The CAP-based method offers a better trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, advancing early exiting techniques.

Abstract: Early exiting has demonstrated great potential in accelerating the inference
of pre-trained language models (PLMs) by enabling easy samples to exit at
shallow layers, eliminating the need for executing deeper layers. However,
existing early exiting methods primarily rely on class-relevant logits to
formulate their exiting signals for estimating prediction certainty, neglecting
the detrimental influence of class-irrelevant information in the features on
prediction certainty. This leads to an overestimation of prediction certainty,
causing premature exiting of samples with incorrect early predictions. To
remedy this, we define an NSP score to estimate prediction certainty by
considering the proportion of class-irrelevant information in the features. On
this basis, we propose a novel early exiting method based on the
Certainty-Aware Probability (CAP) score, which integrates insights from both
logits and the NSP score to enhance prediction certainty estimation, thus
enabling more reliable exiting decisions. The experimental results on the GLUE

*Fudong Lin,Jiadong Lou,Hao Wang,Brian Jalaian,Xu Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a sparse attack method for DNNs, optimizing perturbations under the l0 constraint to improve sparsity, computational efficiency, transferability, and attack strength. It also identifies two noise types for interpreting adversarial vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attacks lack interpretability, suffer from high computational costs, poor transferability, and weak attack strength, motivating the development of a better method.

Method: A novel parameterization technique approximates the NP-hard l0 problem, and a new loss function maximizes adversarial properties while minimizing perturbed pixels.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, and identifies 'obscuring noise' and 'leading noise'.

Conclusion: The method serves as a benchmark for DNN robustness evaluation and provides insights into adversarial vulnerabilities through interpretable noise types.

Abstract: Sparse attacks are to optimize the magnitude of adversarial perturbations for
fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) involving only a few perturbed pixels
(i.e., under the l0 constraint), suitable for interpreting the vulnerability of
DNNs. However, existing solutions fail to yield interpretable adversarial
examples due to their poor sparsity. Worse still, they often struggle with
heavy computational overhead, poor transferability, and weak attack strength.
In this paper, we aim to develop a sparse attack for understanding the
vulnerability of CNNs by minimizing the magnitude of initial perturbations
under the l0 constraint, to overcome the existing drawbacks while achieving a
fast, transferable, and strong attack to DNNs. In particular, a novel and
theoretical sound parameterization technique is introduced to approximate the
NP-hard l0 optimization problem, making directly optimizing sparse
perturbations computationally feasible. Besides, a novel loss function is
designed to augment initial perturbations by maximizing the adversary property
and minimizing the number of perturbed pixels simultaneously. Extensive
experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our approach, with theoretical
performance guarantees, outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attacks in terms of
computational overhead, transferability, and attack strength, expecting to
serve as a benchmark for evaluating the robustness of DNNs. In addition,
theoretical and empirical results validate that our approach yields sparser
adversarial examples, empowering us to discover two categories of noises, i.e.,
"obscuring noise" and "leading noise", which will help interpret how
adversarial perturbation misleads the classifiers into incorrect predictions.

*Dongseok Lee,Jimyung Hong,Dongyoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Referi, a framework that recycles few-shot examples to verify LLM outputs, improving accuracy without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the stochasticity and inconsistency of LLM reasoning by leveraging few-shot examples for verification.

Method: Referi combines two scores (motivated by Bayes' rule) to evaluate and select the best LLM output through additional inferences.

Result: Experiments show a 4.8% average accuracy improvement across seven tasks with three LLMs.

Conclusion: Referi effectively enhances LLM performance by reusing few-shot examples for verification, avoiding costly training steps.

Abstract: Although LLMs have achieved remarkable performance, the inherent
stochasticity of their reasoning process and varying conclusions present
significant challenges. Majority voting or Best-of-N with external verification
models has been explored to find the most promising solution among multiple LLM
outputs. However, these approaches have certain limitations, such as limited
applicability or the cost of an additional training step. To address this
problem, we propose a novel and effective framework that Recycles Few-shot
examples to verify LLM outputs (Referi). Our key idea is to additionally
utilize the given few-shot examples to evaluate the candidate outputs of the
target query, not only using them to generate outputs as the conventional
few-shot prompting setup. Specifically, Referi evaluates the generated outputs
by combining two different scores, designed motivated from Bayes' rule, and
subsequently selects the candidate that is both confidently determined and
contextually coherent through a few additional LLM inferences. Experiments with
three different LLMs and across seven diverse tasks demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs-achieving an average gain
of 4.8%-through effective response selection, without additional training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces SamS, a sample scheduling algorithm for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to dynamically select training samples based on the model's evolving states, improving performance without modifying DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of DPO relies on human preference data quality, but existing data selection methods ignore the model's evolving states during optimization.

Method: Proposes SamS, an adaptive sample scheduling algorithm that selects training samples based on the LLM's learning feedback to enhance generalization.

Result: SamS significantly boosts DPO performance across tasks with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: SamS offers a promising direction for better LLM alignment by optimizing the use of fixed preference datasets.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an effective approach for
aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, its
performance is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying human
preference data. To address this bottleneck, prior work has explored various
data selection strategies, but these methods often overlook the impact of the
evolving states of the language model during the DPO process. %including active
querying, response pair selection, and data pre-selection. In this paper, we
introduce a novel problem: Sample Scheduling for DPO, which aims to dynamically
and adaptively schedule training samples based on the model's evolving states
throughout preference optimization. To solve this problem, we propose SamS, an
efficient and effective algorithm that adaptively selects samples in each
training batch based on the LLM's learning feedback to maximize the potential
generalization performance. Notably, without modifying the core DPO algorithm,
simply integrating SamS significantly improves performance across tasks, with
minimal additional computational overhead. This work points to a promising new
direction for improving LLM alignment through more effective utilization of
fixed preference datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underexplored potential of convolutional networks in long-term time series prediction.

### [322] [Keeping Up with the Models: Online Deployment and Routing of LLMs at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17254)
*Shaoang Li,Jian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StageRoute is a hierarchical algorithm for managing LLM deployments and query routing, achieving near-optimal regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid obsolescence of LLMs and deployment constraints necessitate efficient model management and routing.

Method: StageRoute uses optimistic model selection and budget-constrained bandit routing.

Result: The algorithm achieves near-optimal regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and performs well in experiments.

Conclusion: StageRoute effectively balances deployment and routing under constraints, with theoretical and practical validation.

Abstract: The rapid pace at which new large language models (LLMs) appear -- and older
ones become obsolete -- forces LLM service providers to juggle a streaming
inventory of models while respecting tight deployment capacity and per-query
cost budgets. We cast the reality as an online decision problem that couples
stage-wise deployment, made at fixed maintenance windows, with per-query
routing among the models kept live. We introduce StageRoute, a hierarchical
algorithm that (i) optimistically selects up to $M_max$ models for the next
stage using reward upper-confidence and cost lower-confidence bounds, then (ii)
solves a budget-constrained bandit sub-problem to route each incoming query. We
prove that StageRoute achieves a regret of order $T^{2/3}$ and provide a
matching lower bound, thereby establishing its near-optimality. Moreover, our
experiments confirm the theory, demonstrating that StageRoute performs close to
the optimum in practical settings.

*Sunan Zou,Ziyun Zhang,Xueting Sun,Guojie Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraSketchLLM is a framework for extreme weight compression of LLMs (down to 0.5 bits per weight) using data sketching, avoiding memory overhead and accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory constraints on edge devices require compression beyond 1-bit limits, but existing methods either add overhead or degrade accuracy.

Method: Uses data sketching (AbsMaxMin sketch), importance-aware space allocation, and compression-aware finetuning to map multiple weights to single values with bounded error.

Result: Achieves 0.5-bit compression on Llama-3.2-1B with competitive perplexity and tolerable latency.

Conclusion: UltraSketchLLM enables practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the memory
constraints of edge devices, necessitating extreme weight compression beyond
the 1-bit limit. While quantization reduces model size, it is fundamentally
limited to 1 bit per weight. Existing multiple-to-one compression methods
either rely on mapping tables (inducing memory overhead) or incur severe
accuracy degradation due to random weight grouping. We introduce
UltraSketchLLM, an index-free, sketch-based framework that achieves ultra-low
bit compression (down to 0.5 bits per weight) while preserving model
performance. UltraSketchLLM leverages data sketching, a sub-linear
representation technique from streaming applications, to map multiple weights
to single values with bounded error. Our approach integrates an underestimate
AbsMaxMin sketch to minimize relative errors for small weights,
importance-aware space allocation to prioritize salient weights, and a
straight-through estimator for compression-aware finetuning. Experiments on
Llama-3.2-1B demonstrate up to 0.5-bit compression with competitive perplexity,
alongside tolerable latency overhead. UltraSketchLLM offers a practical
solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ONH biomechanics and explainable AI improve prediction of glaucoma visual field loss patterns, identifying key strain-sensitive regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prediction of progressive visual field loss in glaucoma by incorporating ONH biomechanics and using explainable AI to identify critical regions.

Method: Used ONH imaging under varying IOP, tissue segmentation, digital volume correlation, and Geometric Deep Learning to classify visual field defects.

Result: High AUCs (0.77-0.88) showed ONH strain improves prediction; inferior and inferotemporal rim were key regions.

Conclusion: ONH strain aids in predicting glaucoma progression, with the neuroretinal rim being the most critical region.

Abstract: Objective: (1) To assess whether ONH biomechanics improves prediction of
three progressive visual field loss patterns in glaucoma; (2) to use
explainable AI to identify strain-sensitive ONH regions contributing to these
predictions.
  Methods: We recruited 237 glaucoma subjects. The ONH of one eye was imaged
under two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated
to ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects
into four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:
(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full
superior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).
Automatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to
compute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.
Biomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning
model. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal
step, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect. For
each task, the data were split into 80% training and 20% testing sets. Area
under the curve (AUC) was used to assess performance. Explainable AI techniques
were employed to highlight the ONH regions most critical to each
classification.
  Results: Models achieved high AUCs of 0.77-0.88, showing that ONH strain
improved VF loss prediction beyond morphology alone. The inferior and
inferotemporal rim were identified as key strain-sensitive regions,
contributing most to visual field loss prediction and showing progressive
expansion with increasing disease severity.
  Conclusion and Relevance: ONH strain enhances prediction of glaucomatous VF
loss patterns. Neuroretinal rim, rather than the LC, was the most critical
region contributing to model predictions.

TL;DR: Memory constraints affect agent performance in reinforcement learning, balancing memory allocation between world modeling and planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how limited memory impacts learning and decision-making in unknown environments.

Method: Study memory allocation in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms for episodic and continual learning.

Result: Different memory allocations impact performance, highlighting a trade-off between modeling and planning.

Conclusion: Memory constraints create a critical trade-off in reinforcement learning, influencing agent efficiency.

Abstract: Resource constraints can fundamentally change both learning and
decision-making. We explore how memory constraints influence an agent's
performance when navigating unknown environments using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms. Specifically, memory-constrained agents face a dilemma:
how much of their limited memory should be allocated to each of the agent's
internal processes, such as estimating a world model, as opposed to forming a
plan using that model? We study this dilemma in MCTS- and DQN-based algorithms
and examine how different allocations of memory impact performance in episodic
and continual learning settings.

TL;DR: OAT-Rephrase improves zeroth-order LLM fine-tuning by rephrasing training data to align with optimization dynamics, narrowing the performance gap with gradient-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the slow convergence and instability of zeroth-order optimization (ZO) in LLM fine-tuning by leveraging optimization-aware data rephrasing.

Method: Introduces a dual-stage pipeline with a rewriter LLM and semantic judge to rephrase training instances, ensuring task relevance and logical consistency.

Result: OAT-Rephrase consistently enhances MeZO fine-tuning performance across tasks and LLM architectures, often matching first-order methods.

Conclusion: Optimization-aware rephrasing is a reusable, low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order tuning, bridging the gap with gradient-based approaches.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order optimization (ZO)
offers a memory-efficient alternative to gradient-based methods but suffers
from slower convergence and unstable optimization due to noisy gradient
estimates. This paper introduces OAT-Rephrase, an Optimization-Aware Training
data rephrasing strategy that leverages an LLM to rephrase training instances
based on its understanding of the ZO dynamics, specifically MeZO, derived
directly from its paper. The approach incorporates a dual-stage pipeline
featuring a rewriter LLM and a semantic judge, ensuring all rephrasings retain
task relevance and logical consistency. Evaluations across five classification
tasks and three LLM architectures demonstrate that OAT-Rephrase consistently
improves MeZO fine-tuning performance, often narrowing or eliminating the gap
with first-order methods. Our findings suggest that optimization-aware
rephrasing serves as a reusable and low-overhead enhancement for zeroth-order
tuning regimes.

*Xianren Zhang,Hui Liu,Delvin Ce Zhang,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Dongwon Lee,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a stealthy unlearning attack (SUA) framework to recover unlearned knowledge from MLLMs, revealing privacy risks in unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs may retain sensitive data despite unlearning efforts, raising concerns about true knowledge removal.

Method: Proposes SUA, which learns a universal noise pattern to trigger unlearned content recovery, enhanced by embedding alignment for stealth.

Result: SUA successfully recovers unlearned information, demonstrating consistent knowledge reappearance across unseen images.

Conclusion: Unlearning methods may not fully erase knowledge, highlighting vulnerabilities and the need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on massive data may memorize
sensitive personal information and photos, posing serious privacy risks. To
mitigate this, MLLM unlearning methods are proposed, which fine-tune MLLMs to
reduce the ``forget'' sensitive information. However, it remains unclear
whether the knowledge has been truly forgotten or just hidden in the model.
Therefore, we propose to study a novel problem of LLM unlearning attack, which
aims to recover the unlearned knowledge of an unlearned LLM. To achieve the
goal, we propose a novel framework Stealthy Unlearning Attack (SUA) framework
that learns a universal noise pattern. When applied to input images, this noise
can trigger the model to reveal unlearned content. While pixel-level
perturbations may be visually subtle, they can be detected in the semantic
embedding space, making such attacks vulnerable to potential defenses. To
improve stealthiness, we introduce an embedding alignment loss that minimizes
the difference between the perturbed and denoised image embeddings, ensuring
the attack is semantically unnoticeable. Experimental results show that SUA can
effectively recover unlearned information from MLLMs. Furthermore, the learned
noise generalizes well: a single perturbation trained on a subset of samples
can reveal forgotten content in unseen images. This indicates that knowledge
reappearance is not an occasional failure, but a consistent behavior.

TL;DR: CF-VLM enhances causal reasoning in VLMs using counterfactual samples, outperforming baselines and improving factual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack deep causal reasoning and rely on superficial correlations, limiting fine-grained discrimination.

Method: CF-VLM uses three training objectives: cross-modal alignment, stability against counterfactuals, and sensitivity to causal edits.

Result: CF-VLM outperforms baselines in compositional reasoning and reduces visual hallucinations.

Conclusion: CF-VLM offers a robust foundation for high-stakes applications requiring reliable reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have greatly improved
cross-modal semantic understanding, yet significant limitations remain in
fine-grained discrimination and deep causal reasoning tasks. Existing VLMs
often rely on superficial statistical correlations, lacking the ability to
capture the underlying causal logic between visual and textual content. To
address this, we propose CounterFactual Vision-Language Fine-tuning (CF-VLM), a
novel framework that enhances the causal reasoning capabilities of VLMs through
the targeted use of counterfactual samples. CF-VLM introduces three
complementary training objectives: maintaining foundational cross-modal
alignment, reinforcing the uniqueness and stability of factual scene
representations against coherent counterfactuals, and sharpening the model's
sensitivity to minimal but critical causal edits. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CF-VLM consistently outperforms strong baselines and
state-of-the-art methods on compositional reasoning and generalization
benchmarks. Furthermore, it shows promise in mitigating visual hallucinations,
indicating improved factual consistency. Our CF-VLM provides a robust
foundation for deploying VLMs in high-stakes, real-world scenarios requiring
reliable reasoning and interpretability.

TL;DR: AlgoSelect is a framework for learning optimal algorithm selection using the novel Comb Operator, proven universal, efficient, and robust, with empirical validation showing near-perfect accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting the best algorithm for a given problem by learning from data, ensuring optimality and adaptability.

Method: Introduces the Comb Operator for interpolating between algorithms, extended to an N-Path Comb for multiple algorithms, with theoretical guarantees on universality, learnability, and efficiency.

Result: Achieves near-perfect selection accuracy (99.9%+) with rapid convergence and minimal samples, demonstrating theoretical optimality and practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: AlgoSelect offers a theoretically grounded, deployable solution for automated algorithm selection with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

Abstract: We introduce AlgoSelect, a principled framework for learning optimal
algorithm selection from data, centered around the novel Comb Operator. Given a
set of algorithms and a feature representation of problems, AlgoSelect learns
to interpolate between diverse computational approaches. For pairs of
algorithms, a simple sigmoid-gated selector, an instance of the Comb Operator,
facilitates this interpolation. We extend this to an N-Path Comb for multiple
algorithms. We prove that this framework is universal (can approximate any
algorithm selector), information-theoretically optimal in its learnability
(thresholds for selection converge almost surely, demonstrated via
Borel-Cantelli arguments), computationally efficient, and robust. Key
theoretical contributions include: (1) a universal approximation theorem
demonstrating that Comb-based selectors can achieve arbitrary accuracy; (2)
information-theoretic learnability for selection thresholds; (3) formalization
of the Comb Operator within linear operator theory, detailing its boundedness
and spectral properties; (4) an N-Path Comb generalization for multi-algorithm
selection; and (5) a practical learning framework for the adaptive seeding
functions that guide the Comb Operator. Empirical validation on a comprehensive
20$\times$20 problem-algorithm study demonstrates near-perfect selection
(99.9\%+ accuracy) with remarkably few samples and rapid convergence, revealing
that $H(\text{Algorithm}|\text{Problem}) \approx 0$ in structured domains.
AlgoSelect provides a theoretically grounded, practically deployable solution
to automated algorithm selection with provable optimality and learnability
guarantees, with significant implications for AI and adaptive systems.

*Zhixiang Chi,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yanan Wu,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to adapt CLIP models at test time using few unlabeled examples, improving performance by learning directly on the input space and enhancing text feature dispersion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing domain shift in few-shot test-time adaptation, especially when relying solely on CLIP's frozen features, which may not capture dataset-specific knowledge.

Method: Attaches an independent side branch to CLIP, uses revert attention for exclusive learning, enhances text features via greedy ensemble, and fuses features with domain prompts.

Result: Achieves significant improvements on benchmarks (e.g., +5.1 F1 for iWildCam, +3.1% WC Acc for FMoW).

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively complements CLIP's prior knowledge with dataset-specific learning, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time
to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain
shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities
by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen
features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP,
solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior
knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16,
performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing
from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP,
this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the
dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side
branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive
knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label
semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion
among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and
visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a
generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive
experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS
and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with
gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for
FMoW.

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeT5-Authorship, a model for attributing C programs to specific LLMs, and LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark for evaluation. It achieves high accuracy in binary and multi-class classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI-generated code necessitates methods to identify the specific LLM behind such content, especially for C programs.

Method: The model uses CodeT5's encoder layers with a two-layer classification head. It's evaluated on LLM-AuthorBench, comparing it to traditional ML and transformer models.

Result: Achieves 97.56% accuracy in binary classification (e.g., GPT-4.1 vs. GPT-4o) and 95.40% in multi-class attribution among five LLMs.

Conclusion: CodeT5-Authorship is effective for LLM authorship attribution, with open-sourced tools to support further research.

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated code, deepfakes, and other synthetic content is an
emerging research challenge. As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs)
becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is
increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM
authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel
model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5
encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on
classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a
two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a
probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we
introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs
generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our
model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3,
Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model
achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely
related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class
attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku,

### [333] [Origins of Creativity in Attention-Based Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17324)
*Emma Finn,T. Anderson Keller,Manos Theodosis,Demba E. Ba*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how self-attention in diffusion models enhances global image consistency beyond patch-level mosaics, extending prior theory on CNN-based diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the role of self-attention in diffusion models' creativity and image generation, as prior theory focused only on CNNs.

Method: Extends theory to diffusion models with CNN and self-attention layers, testing predictions on a crafted dataset.

Result: Self-attention induces globally consistent image arrangements, verified empirically.

Conclusion: Self-attention in diffusion models enhances global coherence, advancing understanding of their generative capabilities.

Abstract: As diffusion models have become the tool of choice for image generation and
as the quality of the images continues to improve, the question of how
`creativity' originates in diffusion has become increasingly important. The
score matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for
understanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain
plausible while differing significantly from their training images. In
particular, as explained in (Kamb \& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,
(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we
would only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.
However, as shown by Kamb \& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the
score is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself
(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples
that globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise
`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role
of self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in
this direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose
score is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer. We show that
our theory suggests that self-attention will induce a globally image-consistent
arrangement of local features beyond the patch-level in generated samples, and
we verify this behavior empirically on a carefully crafted dataset.

*Agnideep Aich,Md Monzur Murshed,Sameera Hewage,Amanda Mayeaux*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using A2 copula-based data augmentation to address imbalanced data in diabetes detection, outperforming SMOTE with improved ML metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diabetes detection is crucial, but imbalanced data hinders ML performance. The study aims to improve this using copula-based augmentation.

Method: Used A2 copula for data augmentation on the Pima Indian dataset, applied four ML algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost), and compared results with SMOTE.

Result: XGBoost with A2 copula oversampling outperformed SMOTE, improving accuracy (4.6%), precision (15.6%), recall (20.4%), F1-score (18.2%), and AUC (25.5%). Results were validated with McNemar test.

Conclusion: A2 copula-based augmentation is effective for imbalanced diabetes data, offering a superior alternative to SMOTE and demonstrating copulas' utility in ML.

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus poses a significant health risk, as nearly 1 in 9 people
are affected by it. Early detection can significantly lower this risk. Despite
significant advancements in machine learning for identifying diabetic cases,
results can still be influenced by the imbalanced nature of the data. To
address this challenge, our study considered copula-based data augmentation,
which preserves the dependency structure when generating data for the minority
class and integrates it with machine learning (ML) techniques. We selected the
Pima Indian dataset and generated data using A2 copula, then applied four
machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, gradient
boosting, and extreme gradient boosting. Our findings indicate that XGBoost
combined with A2 copula oversampling achieved the best performance improving
accuracy by 4.6%, precision by 15.6%, recall by 20.4%, F1-score by 18.2% and
AUC by 25.5% compared to the standard SMOTE method. Furthermore, we
statistically validated our results using the McNemar test. This research
represents the first known use of A2 copulas for data augmentation and serves
as an alternative to the SMOTE technique, highlighting the efficacy of copulas
as a statistical method in machine learning applications.

### [335] [AutomataGPT: Forecasting and Ruleset Inference for Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17333)
*Jaime A. Berkovich,Noah S. David,Markus J. Buehler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutomataGPT, a transformer model, achieves high accuracy in predicting and inferring cellular automata rules from data, demonstrating strong generalization without manual priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cellular automata (CA) are powerful for modeling complex systems, but automating rule discovery and prediction is challenging. AutomataGPT aims to address this gap.

Method: AutomataGPT is a decoder-only transformer pretrained on 1 million simulated trajectories from 100 distinct 2D binary CA rules. It predicts and infers rules from data.

Result: The model achieves 98.5% one-step forecast accuracy, 96% functional rule accuracy, and 82% exact rule-matrix match on unseen CA rules.

Conclusion: AutomataGPT shows transformers can infer and execute CA dynamics, enabling efficient modeling of real-world phenomena in diverse fields.

Abstract: Cellular automata (CA) provide a minimal formalism for investigating how
simple local interactions generate rich spatiotemporal behavior in domains as
diverse as traffic flow, ecology, tissue morphogenesis and crystal growth.
However, automatically discovering the local update rules for a given
phenomenon and using them for quantitative prediction remains challenging. Here
we present AutomataGPT, a decoder-only transformer pretrained on around 1
million simulated trajectories that span 100 distinct two-dimensional binary
deterministic CA rules on toroidal grids. When evaluated on previously unseen
rules drawn from the same CA family, AutomataGPT attains 98.5% perfect one-step
forecasts and reconstructs the governing update rule with up to 96% functional
(application) accuracy and 82% exact rule-matrix match. These results
demonstrate that large-scale pretraining over wider regions of rule space
yields substantial generalization in both the forward (state forecasting) and
inverse (rule inference) problems, without hand-crafted priors. By showing that
transformer models can faithfully infer and execute CA dynamics from data
alone, our work lays the groundwork for abstracting real-world dynamical
phenomena into data-efficient CA surrogates, opening avenues in biology, tissue
engineering, physics and AI-driven scientific discovery.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASMS (Adaptive Social Metaverse Streaming) uses F-MAPPO to optimize streaming in the social metaverse, improving user experience by 14% while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and streaming quality are major challenges in the social metaverse due to continuous data collection and real-time demands.

Method: Proposes ASMS, a system based on Federated Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO), combining federated learning and deep reinforcement learning.

Result: ASMS enhances user experience by at least 14% compared to existing methods, maintaining privacy by keeping data local.

Conclusion: ASMS provides seamless, immersive streaming in dynamic networks while safeguarding user privacy.

Abstract: The social metaverse is a growing digital ecosystem that blends virtual and
physical worlds. It allows users to interact socially, work, shop, and enjoy
entertainment. However, privacy remains a major challenge, as immersive
interactions require continuous collection of biometric and behavioral data. At
the same time, ensuring high-quality, low-latency streaming is difficult due to
the demands of real-time interaction, immersive rendering, and bandwidth
optimization. To address these issues, we propose ASMS (Adaptive Social
Metaverse Streaming), a novel streaming system based on Federated Multi-Agent
Proximal Policy Optimization (F-MAPPO). ASMS leverages F-MAPPO, which
integrates federated learning (FL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to
dynamically adjust streaming bit rates while preserving user privacy.
Experimental results show that ASMS improves user experience by at least 14%
compared to existing streaming methods across various network conditions.
Therefore, ASMS enhances the social metaverse experience by providing seamless
and immersive streaming, even in dynamic and resource-constrained networks,
while ensuring that sensitive user data remains on local devices.

TL;DR: The paper introduces FFINO, a neural operator for fast modeling of hydrogen plume migration and pressure in underground hydrogen storage (UHS), outperforming FMIONet in efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for fast and efficient modeling of hydrogen plume migration and pressure evolution in UHS for energy transition.

Method: Proposes FFINO, a neural operator architecture, parameterizing experimental relative permeability curves and comparing it with FMIONet using various metrics.

Result: FFINO reduces trainable parameters (38.1%), training time (17.6%), and GPU memory cost (12%) while improving accuracy (9.8%) and inference speed (7850x faster than numerical simulators).

Conclusion: FFINO is a superior surrogate model for UHS simulations, offering significant efficiency and accuracy advantages.

Abstract: Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) is a promising energy storage option for
the current energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Fast modeling of
hydrogen plume migration and pressure field evolution is crucial for UHS field
management. In this study, we propose a new neural operator architecture,
FFINO, as a fast surrogate model for multiphase flow problems in UHS. We
parameterize experimental relative permeability curves reported in the
literature and include them as key uncertainty parameters in the FFINO model.
We also compare the FFINO model with the state-of-the-art FMIONet model through
a comprehensive combination of metrics. Our new FFINO model has 38.1% fewer
trainable parameters, 17.6% less training time, and 12% less GPU memory cost
compared to FMIONet. The FFINO model also achieves a 9.8% accuracy improvement
in predicting hydrogen plume in focused areas, and 18% higher RMSE in
predicting pressure buildup. The inference time of the trained FFINO model is
7850 times faster than a numerical simulator, which makes it a competent
substitute for numerical simulations of UHS problems with superior time
efficiency.

### [338] [SAFEx: Analyzing Vulnerabilities of MoE-Based LLMs via Stable Safety-critical Expert Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17368)
*Zhenglin Lai,Mengyao Liao,Dong Xu,Zebin Zhao,Zhihang Yuan,Chao Fan,Jianqiang Li,Bingzhe Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies safety alignment challenges in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, introduces SAFEx to analyze and address these vulnerabilities, and demonstrates their impact on model safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety alignment strategies for dense models are unsuitable for MoE architectures, which exhibit unique vulnerabilities due to their reliance on specific expert modules.

Method: The authors propose SAFEx, a framework using Stability-based Expert Selection (SES) to identify and characterize safety-critical experts in MoE models.

Result: Experiments on models like Qwen3-MoE show that disabling a small subset of safety-critical experts (e.g., 12 out of 6144) can reduce refusal rates by 22%, highlighting their disproportionate impact.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for tailored safety alignment strategies for MoE models, as their vulnerabilities are concentrated in specific expert modules.

Abstract: Large language models based on Mixture-of-Experts have achieved substantial
gains in efficiency and scalability, yet their architectural uniqueness
introduces underexplored safety alignment challenges. Existing safety alignment
strategies, predominantly designed for dense models, are ill-suited to address
MoE-specific vulnerabilities. In this work, we formalize and systematically
study MoE model's positional vulnerability - the phenomenon where
safety-aligned behaviors rely on specific expert modules, revealing critical
risks inherent to MoE architectures. To this end, we present SAFEx, an
analytical framework that robustly identifies, characterizes, and validates the
safety-critical experts using a novel Stability-based Expert Selection (SES)
algorithm. Notably, our approach enables the explicit decomposition of
safety-critical experts into distinct functional groups, including those
responsible for harmful content detection and those controlling safe response
generation. Extensive experiments on mainstream MoE models, such as the
recently released Qwen3-MoE, demonstrated that their intrinsic safety
mechanisms heavily rely on a small subset of positional experts. Disabling
these experts significantly compromised the models' ability to refuse harmful
requests. For Qwen3-MoE with 6144 experts (in the FNN layer), we find that
disabling as few as 12 identified safety-critical experts can cause the refusal
rate to drop by 22%, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of a small set
of experts on overall model safety.

### [339] [Aha Moment Revisited: Are VLMs Truly Capable of Self Verification in Inference-time Scaling?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17417)
*Mingyuan Wu,Meitang Li,Jingcheng Yang,Jize Jiang,Kaizhuo Yan,Zhaoheng Li,Minjia Zhang,Klara Nahrstedt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Inference-time techniques like self-correction and self-verification, effective in LLMs, are explored for VLMs. While some methods improve reasoning, RL-trained VLMs lack robust self-verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if inference-time techniques (e.g., self-correction) from LLMs extend to VLMs, especially those trained with RL.

Method: Evaluated decoding strategies (majority voting, best-of-N) and self-verification in VLMs.

Result: Generation-reliant methods outperform verification-reliant ones; RL-trained VLMs lack robust self-verification.

Conclusion: Inference-time techniques for VLMs show promise but are limited by weak self-verification in RL-trained models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
inference-time computation techniques, such as decoding-time scaling and
self-refinement, can significantly enhance reasoning capabilities without
relying on external knowledge. A key driver of this success is the emergence of
self-correction and self-verification behaviors, often elicited through
reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper, we investigate whether these
inference-time techniques extend effectively to vision-language models (VLMs),
particularly those trained with RL. We find that while decoding strategies such
as majority voting and best-of-N selection with self-verification all improve
VLM reasoning performance, generation-reliant methods such as the former
achieve significantly higher gains versus verification-reliant methods such as
the latter. Additionally, the self-correction behavior often associated with
RL-tuned models, such as aha moment, does not lead to measurable gains. We show
via extensive experimentation within the inference-time scaling framework to
identify a key root cause: RL-trained VLMs still lack robust self-verification
capabilities across both visual and textual modalities.

TL;DR: FedNAMs combine Neural Additive Models with federated learning for interpretability, privacy, and robustness, showing minimal accuracy loss compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of interpretability and explainability in federated learning while enhancing privacy and model robustness.

Method: Introduces Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs), integrating NAMs' feature-specific learning with federated learning's decentralized approach.

Result: FedNAMs achieve strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss, identifying key predictive features in datasets like wine quality, heart disease, and iris classification.

Conclusion: FedNAMs improve privacy, efficiency, interpretability, and robustness, providing insights into feature interpretability.

Abstract: Federated learning continues to evolve but faces challenges in
interpretability and explainability. To address these challenges, we introduce
a novel approach that employs Neural Additive Models (NAMs) within a federated
learning framework. This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)
approach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate
on specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated
learning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration
enhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby
minimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model
robustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific
learning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and
healthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate
local updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to
centralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,
using datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show
that FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss
compared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research
involves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive
features at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and
chlorides for wine quality. Chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and number of
vessels for heart disease. Petal length and width for iris classification. This
approach strengthens privacy and model efficiency and improves interpretability
and robustness across diverse datasets. Finally, FedNAMs generate insights on
causes of highly and low interpretable features.

*Steffen SchotthÃ¶fer,Timon Klein,Jonas Kusch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes challenges in training low-rank neural networks with classical optimizers and proposes new geometric-aware strategies for better convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address difficulties like poor convergence in low-rank training due to optimization landscape geometry.

Method: Introduces novel training strategies combining dynamical low-rank approximation and momentum-based optimization.

Result: Validated through experiments, showing faster convergence and improved validation metrics.

Conclusion: Proposed methods outperform classical optimizers by leveraging geometric structure of low-rank parameterizations.

Abstract: Low-rank pre-training and fine-tuning have recently emerged as promising
techniques for reducing the computational and storage costs of large neural
networks. Training low-rank parameterizations typically relies on conventional
optimizers such as heavy ball momentum methods or Adam. In this work, we
identify and analyze potential difficulties that these training methods
encounter when used to train low-rank parameterizations of weights. In
particular, we show that classical momentum methods can struggle to converge to
a local optimum due to the geometry of the underlying optimization landscape.
To address this, we introduce novel training strategies derived from dynamical
low-rank approximation, which explicitly account for the underlying geometric
structure. Our approach leverages and combines tools from dynamical low-rank
approximation and momentum-based optimization to design optimizers that respect
the intrinsic geometry of the parameter space. We validate our methods through
numerical experiments, demonstrating faster convergence, and stronger
validation metrics at given parameter budgets.

*Xuanyu Zhuang,Geoffroy Peeters,GaÃ«l Richard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes episode-specific fine-tuning methods for metric-based few-shot classification models to better utilize support samples and avoid overfitting, validated across diverse audio datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Support samples in few-shot classification are underutilized, only used for similarity comparison, despite their potential to adapt the metric space.

Method: Proposes Rotational Division Fine-Tuning (RDFT) and variants (IDFT, ADFT), combined with optimization-based meta-learning to prevent overfitting.

Result: The approach improves performance for metric-based models, especially attention-based ones, across ESC-50, Speech Commands V2, and Medley-solos-DB datasets.

Conclusion: Episode-specific fine-tuning and meta-training enhance model adaptability to limited support samples, generalizing well across audio domains.

Abstract: In few-shot classification tasks (so-called episodes), a small set of labeled
support samples is provided during inference to aid the classification of
unlabeled query samples. Metric-based models typically operate by computing
similarities between query and support embeddings within a learned metric
space, followed by nearest-neighbor classification. However, these labeled
support samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity
comparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space
itself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a
series of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning
methods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning
(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and
Augmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT). These methods construct pseudo
support-query pairs from the given support set to enable fine-tuning even for
non-parametric models. Nevertheless, the severely limited amount of data in
each task poses a substantial risk of overfitting when applying such
fine-tuning strategies. To mitigate this, we further propose to train the
metric-based model within an optimization-based meta-learning framework. With
the combined efforts of episode-specific fine-tuning and optimization-based
meta-training, metric-based models are equipped with the ability to rapidly
adapt to the limited support samples during inference while avoiding
overfitting. We validate our approach on three audio datasets from diverse
domains, namely ESC-50 (environmental sounds), Speech Commands V2 (spoken
keywords), and Medley-solos-DB (musical instrument). Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance for all
evaluated metric-based models (especially for attention-based models) and
generalizes well across different audio domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of user behavior is vital for optimizing inventory, personalization, and sales in online retail.

Method: Adapts reinforcement learning to supervised learning, using LSTM for sequential data and DQN for decision-making, tested on 885,000 user sessions.

Result: Handles class imbalance well, balances precision and recall, outperforms traditional methods in capturing temporal patterns.

Conclusion: The model is scalable and effective for real-world e-commerce, enhancing demand forecasting and personalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to predicting buying intent and product
demand in e-commerce settings, leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) inspired
architecture. In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate
prediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,
personalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts
concepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,
combining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
networks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user
sessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates
robust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in
e-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than
non-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various
classification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between
precision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\% and an AUC-ROC score of
0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers
advantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning
approaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in
user behavior. The model's performance and scalability make it well-suited for
real-world e-commerce applications dealing with high-dimensional, sequential
data. This research contributes to the field of e-commerce analytics by
introducing a novel predictive modeling technique that combines the strengths
of deep learning and reinforcement learning paradigms. Our findings have
significant implications for improving demand forecasting, personalizing user
experiences, and optimizing marketing strategies in online retail environments.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model for rectal cancer, integrating AI and multi-view data (MRI and clinical) to improve surgical difficulty assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical difficulty evaluation relies on clinical data, but advancements in technology and AI enable more comprehensive data collection and analysis for better treatment outcomes.

Method: Constructs a multi-view dataset (MRI, pressed-fat MRI, clinical data) and develops a dual representation incomplete multi-view learning model with missing view imputation and second-order similarity. Uses a TSK fuzzy system for evaluation with cooperative learning and Shannon entropy for view weighting.

Result: The proposed DRIMV_TSK model outperforms advanced algorithms on the MVRC dataset.

Conclusion: The model enhances surgical evaluation by leveraging multi-view data and AI, addressing real-world data incompleteness and improving interpretability.

Abstract: A reliable evaluation of surgical difficulty can improve the success of the
treatment for rectal cancer and the current evaluation method is based on
clinical data. However, more data about rectal cancer can be collected with the
development of technology. Meanwhile, with the development of artificial
intelligence, its application in rectal cancer treatment is becoming possible.
In this paper, a multi-view rectal cancer dataset is first constructed to give
a more comprehensive view of patients, including the high-resolution MRI image
view, pressed-fat MRI image view, and clinical data view. Then, an
interpretable incomplete multi-view surgical evaluation model is proposed,
considering that it is hard to obtain extensive and complete patient data in
real application scenarios. Specifically, a dual representation incomplete
multi-view learning model is first proposed to extract the common information
between views and specific information in each view. In this model, the missing
view imputation is integrated into representation learning, and second-order
similarity constraint is also introduced to improve the cooperative learning
between these two parts. Then, based on the imputed multi-view data and the
learned dual representation, a multi-view surgical evaluation model with the
TSK fuzzy system is proposed. In the proposed model, a cooperative learning
mechanism is constructed to explore the consistent information between views,
and Shannon entropy is also introduced to adapt the view weight. On the MVRC
dataset, we compared it with several advanced algorithms and DRIMV_TSK obtained
the best results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Residual RL is improved for stochastic policies by leveraging base policy uncertainty and modifying off-policy learning, outperforming baselines in simulations and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Residual RL methods struggle with sparse rewards and deterministic base policies, limiting their applicability.

Method: Proposes using base policy uncertainty for focused exploration and a modified off-policy residual learning approach for stochastic policies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simulation benchmarks and demonstrates robust real-world performance.

Conclusion: The enhancements make Residual RL more efficient and adaptable to stochastic policies, with successful real-world deployment.

Abstract: Residual Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a popular approach for adapting
pretrained policies by learning a lightweight residual policy that provides
corrective actions. While Residual RL is more sample-efficient than finetuning
the entire base policy, existing methods struggle with sparse rewards and are
designed for deterministic base policies. We propose two improvements to
Residual RL that further enhance its sample efficiency and make it suitable for
stochastic base policies. First, we leverage uncertainty estimates of the base
policy to focus exploration on regions in which the base policy is not
confident. Second, we propose a simple modification to off-policy residual
learning that allows it to observe base actions and better handle stochastic
base policies. We evaluate our method with both Gaussian-based and
Diffusion-based stochastic base policies on tasks from Robosuite and D4RL, and
compare against state-of-the-art finetuning methods, demo-augmented RL methods,
and other residual RL methods. Our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
baselines in a variety of simulation benchmark environments. We also deploy our
learned polices in the real world to demonstrate their robustness with
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.

TL;DR: The paper identifies trainable linear transformations in GCNs as a key factor in feature collapse and proposes Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT) to balance expressiveness and stability in deep architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep GCNs suffer from over-smoothing and feature collapse, exacerbated by trainable linear transformations, while removing them weakens expressive power.

Method: Proposes LGT, integrating layer-wise training, low-rank adaptation, and identity initialization to stabilize and enhance deep GCNs.

Result: LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, even at 32 layers, and works well with existing methods.

Conclusion: LGT provides a scalable, architecture-agnostic training framework for deep GCNs, balancing expressiveness and stability.

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance
degradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies
primarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph
Laplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked
factor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate
feature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,
Simplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,
maintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear
transformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing
over-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the
model's expressive capacity.
  To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise Gradual Training (LGT), a
novel training strategy that progressively builds deep GCNs while preserving
their expressiveness. LGT integrates three complementary components: (1)
layer-wise training to stabilize optimization from shallow to deep layers, (2)
low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow layers and accelerate training, and
(3) identity initialization to ensure smooth integration of new layers and
accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly
improving accuracy even in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method,
LGT can be seamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and
ContraNorm, further enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers
a general, architecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The
code is available at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].

*Jing Wang,Biao Chen,Hairun Xie,Rui Wang,Yifan Xia,Jifa Zhang,Hui Xu*

TL;DR: LFR-PINO introduces a layered hypernetwork and frequency-domain reduction to improve physics-informed neural operators for solving parametric PDEs, achieving significant error reduction and memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for solving parametric PDEs with physics-informed neural operators face limitations in expressiveness or computational efficiency due to high dimensionality.

Method: LFR-PINO uses a layered hypernetwork for specialized parameter generation and frequency-domain reduction to cut parameter count while preserving spectral features.

Result: LFR-PINO reduces errors by 22.8%-68.7% and memory usage by 28.6%-69.3% compared to baselines, maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: LFR-PINO offers an efficient, accurate solution for parametric PDEs, balancing computational efficiency and fidelity.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
solving parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in the
aerospace field, enabling the learning of solution operators that generalize
across parameter spaces. However, existing methods either suffer from limited
expressiveness due to fixed basis/coefficient designs, or face computational
challenges due to the high dimensionality of the parameter-to-weight mapping
space. We present LFR-PINO, a novel physics-informed neural operator that
introduces two key innovations: (1) a layered hypernetwork architecture that
enables specialized parameter generation for each network layer, and (2) a
frequency-domain reduction strategy that significantly reduces parameter count
while preserving essential spectral features. This design enables efficient
learning of a universal PDE solver through pre-training, capable of directly
handling new equations while allowing optional fine-tuning for enhanced
precision. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through
comprehensive experiments on four representative PDE problems, where LFR-PINO
achieves 22.8%-68.7% error reduction compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
Notably, frequency-domain reduction strategy reduces memory usage by
28.6%-69.3% compared to Hyper-PINNs while maintaining solution accuracy,
striking an optimal balance between computational efficiency and solution
fidelity.

*Chicheng Zhang,Yihan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper focuses on active multi-distribution learning, improving label complexity bounds in realizable and agnostic settings, and proving optimality for some cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-distribution learning is important for collaborative learning, fairness, and robustness, but active learning in this context lacks optimal algorithms.

Method: Develops new algorithms for active multi-distribution learning, analyzing label complexity bounds in distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings.

Result: Proves upper bounds for realizable and agnostic settings, showing optimality in the realizable case and fundamental limits for agnostic proper learners.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of active multi-distribution learning with tight bounds and highlights key challenges for future research.

Abstract: Multi-distribution learning extends agnostic Probably Approximately Correct
(PAC) learning to the setting in which a family of $k$ distributions,
$\{D_i\}_{i\in[k]}$, is considered and a classifier's performance is measured
by its error under the worst distribution. This problem has attracted a lot of
recent interests due to its applications in collaborative learning, fairness,
and robustness. Despite a rather complete picture of sample complexity of
passive multi-distribution learning, research on active multi-distribution
learning remains scarce, with algorithms whose optimality remaining unknown.
  In this paper, we develop new algorithms for active multi-distribution
learning and establish improved label complexity upper and lower bounds, in
distribution-dependent and distribution-free settings. Specifically, in the
near-realizable setting we prove an upper bound of
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\Bigr)$ and
$\widetilde{O}\Bigl(\theta_{\max}(d+k)\Bigl(\ln\frac{1}{\varepsilon}+\frac{\nu^2}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)+\frac{k\nu}{\varepsilon^2}\Bigr)$
in the realizable and agnostic settings respectively, where $\theta_{\max}$ is
the maximum disagreement coefficient among the $k$ distributions, $d$ is the VC
dimension of the hypothesis class, $\nu$ is the multi-distribution error of the
best hypothesis, and $\varepsilon$ is the target excess error. Moreover, we
show that the bound in the realizable setting is information-theoretically
optimal and that the $k\nu/\varepsilon^2$ term in the agnostic setting is
fundamental for proper learners. We also establish instance-dependent sample
complexity bound for passive multidistribution learning that smoothly
interpolates between realizable and agnostic
regimes~\citep{blum2017collaborative,zhang2024optimal}, which may be of
independent interest.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EQuARX introduces a dynamic block-wise quantized AllReduce for TPUs, improving speed by 1.8X over BF16 AllReduce with minimal quality impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) face deployment challenges due to inter-device communication overhead. Quantizing collectives like AllReduce is difficult due to numerical instability.

Method: Develops EQuARX, a native dynamic block-wise quantized AllReduce within the XLA compiler for TPUs, using TPU-friendly quantization and deep pipelining.

Result: Achieves 1.8X speedup over BF16 AllReduce, and accelerates prefill stages of Gemma 3 models by 1.25X and 1.1X with negligible quality impact.

Conclusion: EQuARX effectively reduces communication overhead in LLM deployment, enhancing performance without compromising model quality.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become highly influential, their
enormous scale presents significant deployment challenges. Efficiently serving
these models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator
devices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device
communication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted
to reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations
with minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like
AllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,
which can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In
this work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce
within the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization
and deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision
achieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network
topologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by
1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on
quality.

### [351] [Trustworthy Chronic Disease Risk Prediction For Self-Directed Preventive Care via Medical Literature Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17620)
*Minh Le,Khoi Ton*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes deep learning models for predicting chronic disease risk using personal/lifestyle data, validated with SHAP-based explainability against medical literature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in existing models (reliance on medical tests, lack of validated explanations) and enable trustworthy self-assessment.

Method: Developed deep learning models using personal/lifestyle factors, with SHAP-based explainability validated against medical literature.

Result: Strong alignment between model features and medical literature, supporting trustworthiness across 13 diseases.

Conclusion: The approach provides a foundation for trustworthy self-directed preventive care, with future research needed on ethical use and additional trust-building methods.

Abstract: Chronic diseases are long-term, manageable, yet typically incurable
conditions, highlighting the need for effective preventive strategies. Machine
learning has been widely used to assess individual risk for chronic diseases.
However, many models rely on medical test data (e.g. blood results, glucose
levels), which limits their utility for proactive self-assessment.
Additionally, to gain public trust, machine learning models should be
explainable and transparent. Although some research on self-assessment machine
learning models includes explainability, their explanations are not validated
against established medical literature, reducing confidence in their
reliability. To address these issues, we develop deep learning models that
predict the risk of developing 13 chronic diseases using only personal and
lifestyle factors, enabling accessible, self-directed preventive care.
Importantly, we use SHAP-based explainability to identify the most influential
model features and validate them against established medical literature. Our
results show a strong alignment between the models' most influential features
and established medical literature, reinforcing the models' trustworthiness.
Critically, we find that this observation holds across 13 distinct diseases,
indicating that this machine learning approach can be broadly trusted for
chronic disease prediction. This work lays the foundation for developing
trustworthy machine learning tools for self-directed preventive care. Future
research can explore other approaches for models' trustworthiness and discuss
how the models can be used ethically and responsibly.

### [352] [Exploiting Efficiency Vulnerabilities in Dynamic Deep Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17621)
*Ravishka Rathnasuriya,Wei Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores security risks in dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) due to input-dependent execution, revealing efficiency vulnerabilities exploitable by adversaries. It surveys attacks, identifies gaps, and proposes defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient deep learning inference under constraints has led to DDLSs, but their dynamic nature introduces underexplored security risks, such as efficiency vulnerabilities.

Method: The work investigates security implications of DDLSs, surveys attack strategies, identifies gaps, and proposes defenses for robustness.

Result: Current DDLSs expose efficiency vulnerabilities to adversarial inputs, with gaps in attack coverage and defense limitations.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for targeted defenses to secure DDLSs against efficiency attacks and ensure robustness.

Abstract: The growing deployment of deep learning models in real-world environments has
intensified the need for efficient inference under strict latency and resource
constraints. To meet these demands, dynamic deep learning systems (DDLSs) have
emerged, offering input-adaptive computation to optimize runtime efficiency.
While these systems succeed in reducing cost, their dynamic nature introduces
subtle and underexplored security risks. In particular, input-dependent
execution pathways create opportunities for adversaries to degrade efficiency,
resulting in excessive latency, energy usage, and potential denial-of-service
in time-sensitive deployments. This work investigates the security implications
of dynamic behaviors in DDLSs and reveals how current systems expose efficiency
vulnerabilities exploitable by adversarial inputs. Through a survey of existing
attack strategies, we identify gaps in the coverage of emerging model
architectures and limitations in current defense mechanisms. Building on these
insights, we propose to examine the feasibility of efficiency attacks on modern
DDLSs and develop targeted defenses to preserve robustness under adversarial
conditions.

*Zesen Wang,Yonggang Li,Lijuan Lan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-Prompt is a framework using large language models (LLMs) for time series forecasting, addressing shortcomings like lack of unified prompts and modality discrepancies through multi-prompt integration and cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based methods for time series forecasting lack a unified prompt paradigm and ignore modality differences between text and time series data.

Method: Proposes LLM-Prompt, which includes learnable soft prompts, textualized hard prompts, and a cross-modal alignment module to fuse temporal and textual information.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on 6 public and 3 carbon emission datasets, showing LLM-Prompt as a robust forecasting framework.

Conclusion: LLM-Prompt successfully addresses key limitations in LLM-based time series forecasting, offering a powerful and unified solution.

Abstract: Time series forecasting aims to model temporal dependencies among variables
for future state inference, holding significant importance and widespread
applications in real-world scenarios. Although deep learning-based methods have
achieved remarkable progress, they still exhibit suboptimal performance in
long-term forecasting and data-scarce scenarios. Recent research demonstrates
that large language models (LLMs) achieve promising performance in time series
forecasting. However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have
shortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt
formulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual
prompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based
time series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and
cross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified
textual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard
prompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the
forecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal
alignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual
information. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected
to obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3
carbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework
for time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a contextual bandit framework for adaptive multi-LLM selection in online settings, addressing dynamic prompt changes and achieving sublinear regret without offline data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in selecting the most suitable LLM for user queries due to diverse behaviors, costs, and strengths, especially in dynamic, unstructured contexts.

Method: Introduces a LinUCB-based algorithm for sequential LLM selection under unstructured prompt dynamics, with budget-aware and positionally-aware extensions.

Result: Outperforms existing LLM routing strategies in accuracy and cost-efficiency across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: Validates contextual bandits as effective for real-time, adaptive LLM selection without offline fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse response behaviors, costs, and
strengths, making it challenging to select the most suitable LLM for a given
user query. We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online
setting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query
refinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets
or model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:
the prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a
black-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address
this, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM
selection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic
regret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear
regret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce
budget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)
extensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early
high-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require
no offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training. Experiments on diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that our methods outperform existing LLM routing
strategies in both accuracy and cost-efficiency, validating the power of
contextual bandits for real-time, adaptive LLM selection.

### [355] [Learning Personalized Utility Functions for Drivers in Ride-hailing Systems Using Ensemble Hypernetworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17672)
*Weiming Mai,Jie Gao,Oded Cats*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using hypernetwork and ensemble learning to predict ride-hailing drivers' decisions, improving accuracy and personalization over traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models like RUM fail to capture non-linear interactions and personalized preferences, limiting prediction accuracy in ride-hailing systems.

Method: Develops a hypernetwork-based ensemble learning approach to dynamically generate personalized utility functions, accounting for non-linear relationships and driver-specific preferences.

Result: The model outperforms traditional methods in accuracy and uncertainty estimation, revealing key attributes influencing driver decisions.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances prediction accuracy, explainability, and personalization, offering valuable insights for ride-hailing systems.

Abstract: In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride
requests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,
and personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential
for improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional
models, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically
predict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.
However, these models often fall short because they fail to account for
non-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,
personalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a
method for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and
ensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear
utility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the
non-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different
data segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by
introducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate
the performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction
accuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results
demonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's
utility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and
uncertainty quantification. Additionally, our model serves as a powerful tool
for revealing the personalized preferences of different drivers, clearly
illustrating which attributes largely impact their rider acceptance decisions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FaithfulSAE trains SAEs on model-generated synthetic data to improve stability and feature accuracy, outperforming traditional SAEs trained on external datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instability and inaccuracy in SAEs due to training on out-of-distribution external datasets, leading to 'Fake Features'.

Method: Proposes FaithfulSAE, which trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset to reduce OOD issues.

Result: FaithfulSAEs show better stability across seeds, outperform web-based SAEs in probing tasks, and reduce Fake Features in most models.

Conclusion: FaithfulSAE eliminates external dataset dependency, improving interpretability by capturing model-internal features more accurately.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for
decomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.
However, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different
initialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not
capture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs
on external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another
model - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's
generalisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,
which we term "Fake Features", that misrepresent the model's internal
activations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that
trains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we
demonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs
being more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained
on web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature
Ratio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on
external datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing
model-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of
SAE training datasets.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates GNN vulnerability to model extraction attacks (MEAs) and proposes an adaptive node querying strategy for efficient GNN training in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs are widely used but vulnerable to MEAs, and labeling data is costly, especially in domains like biomedicine. The work aims to address these challenges.

Method: Proposes an iterative node querying strategy that refines selection over learning cycles, leveraging historical feedback under strict query constraints.

Result: Outperforms baselines in accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score, showing GNN susceptibility to MEAs and the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: Highlights GNN security risks and the potential of ethical, efficient acquisition methods for low-resource research.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility across
diverse applications, and their growing complexity has made Machine Learning as
a Service (MLaaS) a viable platform for scalable deployment. However, this
accessibility also exposes GNN to serious security threats, most notably model
extraction attacks (MEAs), in which adversaries strategically query a deployed
model to construct a high-fidelity replica. In this work, we evaluate the
vulnerability of GNNs to MEAs and explore their potential for cost-effective
model acquisition in non-adversarial research settings. Importantly, adaptive
node querying strategies can also serve a critical role in research,
particularly when labeling data is expensive or time-consuming. By selectively
sampling informative nodes, researchers can train high-performing GNNs with
minimal supervision, which is particularly valuable in domains such as
biomedicine, where annotations often require expert input. To address this, we
propose a node querying strategy tailored to a highly practical yet
underexplored scenario, where bulk queries are prohibited, and only a limited
set of initial nodes is available. Our approach iteratively refines the node
selection mechanism over multiple learning cycles, leveraging historical
feedback to improve extraction efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrate our superiority over comparable baselines on
accuracy, fidelity, and F1 score under strict query-size constraints. These
results highlight both the susceptibility of deployed GNNs to extraction
attacks and the promise of ethical, efficient GNN acquisition methods to
support low-resource research environments.

TL;DR: SYNC is a method for evolving domain generalization (EDG) that uses a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) to avoid spurious correlations and improve generalization by learning time-aware causal representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EDG methods often fail due to spurious correlations, limiting generalization in dynamic scenarios with evolving data distributions.

Method: SYNC integrates information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework to capture evolving patterns and preserve intra-class compactness of causal factors.

Result: SYNC achieves superior temporal generalization performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SYNC effectively addresses evolving domain generalization by learning time-aware causal representations, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Endowing deep models with the ability to generalize in dynamic scenarios is
of vital significance for real-world deployment, given the continuous and
complex changes in data distribution. Recently, evolving domain generalization
(EDG) has emerged to address distribution shifts over time, aiming to capture
evolving patterns for improved model generalization. However, existing EDG
methods may suffer from spurious correlations by modeling only the dependence
between data and targets across domains, creating a shortcut between
task-irrelevant factors and the target, which hinders generalization. To this
end, we design a time-aware structural causal model (SCM) that incorporates
dynamic causal factors and the causal mechanism drifts, and propose
\textbf{S}tatic-D\textbf{YN}amic \textbf{C}ausal Representation Learning
(\textbf{SYNC}), an approach that effectively learns time-aware causal
representations. Specifically, it integrates specially designed
information-theoretic objectives into a sequential VAE framework which captures
evolving patterns, and produces the desired representations by preserving
intra-class compactness of causal factors both across and within domains.
Moreover, we theoretically show that our method can yield the optimal causal
predictor for each time domain. Results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets exhibit that SYNC can achieve superior temporal generalization
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retired EV batteries can support low-carbon energy systems, but degradation uncertainties and data inaccessibility hinder safe, scalable deployment.

Method: PIMOE uses an adaptive multi-degradation prediction module and a use-dependent recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction, validated on extensive battery data.

Result: PIMOE achieves 0.88% MAPE with 0.43 ms inference time, outperforming state-of-the-art models in speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: PIMOE provides a deployable, history-free solution for battery degradation prediction, enhancing second-life energy storage integration.

Abstract: Retired electric vehicle batteries offer immense potential to support
low-carbon energy systems, but uncertainties in their degradation behavior and
data inaccessibilities under second-life use pose major barriers to safe and
scalable deployment. This work proposes a Physics-Informed Mixture of Experts
(PIMOE) network that computes battery degradation trajectories using partial,
field-accessible signals in a single cycle. PIMOE leverages an adaptive
multi-degradation prediction module to classify degradation modes using expert
weight synthesis underpinned by capacity-voltage and relaxation data, producing
latent degradation trend embeddings. These are input to a use-dependent
recurrent network for long-term trajectory prediction. Validated on 207
batteries across 77 use conditions and 67,902 cycles, PIMOE achieves an average
mean absolute percentage (MAPE) errors of 0.88% with a 0.43 ms inference time.
Compared to the state-of-the-art Informer and PatchTST, it reduces
computational time and MAPE by 50%, respectively. Compatible with random state
of charge region sampling, PIMOE supports 150-cycle forecasts with 1.50%
average and 6.26% maximum MAPE, and operates effectively even with pruned 5MB
training data. Broadly, PIMOE framework offers a deployable, history-free
solution for battery degradation trajectory computation, redefining how
second-life energy storage systems are assessed, optimized, and integrated into
the sustainable energy landscape.

Motivation: Addressing limitations of current spectral analysis methods like single-modality reliance, poor interpretability, and limited generalizability.

Method: Transforms raw spectra into Textual Graphs (TAGs), merges with prior knowledge, and uses a Graph Neural Network for downstream tasks with LLM-based reasoning.

Result: Consistently high performance in spectral analysis tasks, robust generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Establishes a scalable, interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis, unifying physical and chemical modalities.

Abstract: Motivated by the limitations of current spectral analysis methods-such as
reliance on single-modality data, limited generalizability, and poor
interpretability-we propose a novel multi-modal spectral analysis framework
that integrates prior knowledge graphs with Large Language Models. Our method
explicitly bridges physical spectral measurements and chemical structural
semantics by representing them in a unified Textual Graph format, enabling
flexible, interpretable, and generalizable spectral understanding. Raw spectra
are first transformed into TAGs, where nodes and edges are enriched with
textual attributes describing both spectral properties and chemical context.
These are then merged with relevant prior knowledge-including functional groups
and molecular graphs-to form a Task Graph that incorporates "Prompt Nodes"
supporting LLM-based contextual reasoning. A Graph Neural Network further
processes this structure to complete downstream tasks. This unified design
enables seamless multi-modal integration and automated feature decoding with
minimal manual annotation. Our framework achieves consistently high performance
across multiple spectral analysis tasks, including node-level, edge-level, and
graph-level classification. It demonstrates robust generalization in both
zero-shot and few-shot settings, highlighting its effectiveness in learning
from limited data and supporting in-context reasoning. This work establishes a
scalable and interpretable foundation for LLM-driven spectral analysis,
unifying physical and chemical modalities for scientific applications.

*Keigo Nishida,Eren Mehmet KÄ±ral,Kenichi Bannai,Mohammad Emtiyaz Khan,Thomas MÃ¶llenhoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD) algorithm inspired by biological synapses, enabling stable low-precision training in artificial neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological synapses exhibit log-normal dynamics, prompting the exploration of similar multiplicative training in artificial networks for stability under noisy conditions.

Method: A Bayesian learning rule with log-normal posterior distributions over weights is derived, leading to the LMD algorithm, which uses multiplicative updates with noise and regularization.

Result: LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch for Vision Transformer and GPT-2 under low-precision forward operations.

Conclusion: Multiplicative dynamics, inspired by biology, may enhance stable low-precision inference and learning in energy-efficient hardware.

Abstract: Studies in neuroscience have shown that biological synapses follow a
log-normal distribution whose transitioning can be explained by noisy
multiplicative dynamics. Biological networks can function stably even under
dynamically fluctuating conditions arising due to unreliable synaptic
transmissions. Here we ask: Is it possible to design similar multiplicative
training in artificial neural networks? To answer this question, we derive a
Bayesian learning rule that assumes log-normal posterior distributions over
weights which gives rise to a new Log-Normal Multiplicative Dynamics (LMD)
algorithm. The algorithm uses multiplicative updates with both noise and
regularization applied multiplicatively. The method is as easy to implement as
Adam and only requires one additional vector to store. Our results show that
LMD achieves stable and accurate training-from-scratch under low-precision
forward operations for Vision Transformer and GPT-2. These results suggest that
multiplicative dynamics, a biological feature, may enable stable low-precision
inference and learning on future energy-efficient hardware.

### [363] [PhysiX: A Foundation Model for Physics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17774)
*Tung Nguyen,Arsh Koneru,Shufan Li,Aditya grover*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PhysiX, a 4.5B parameter foundation model for physics simulation, overcomes data scarcity by tokenizing physical processes and refining discretization errors, outperforming task-specific methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models excel in video, image, and language but lag in physics simulation due to data scarcity and scale variability. PhysiX aims to bridge this gap.

Method: PhysiX tokenizes physical processes into discrete sequences, uses autoregressive next-token prediction, and includes a refinement module to reduce discretization errors.

Result: PhysiX outperforms task-specific baselines and previous state-of-the-art methods on The Well benchmark, showing successful knowledge transfer from natural videos.

Conclusion: Joint training across diverse physics tasks enables synergistic learning, demonstrating the potential of foundation models in physics simulation.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across video, image, and
language domains. By scaling up the number of parameters and training datasets,
these models acquire generalizable world knowledge and often surpass
task-specific approaches. However, such progress has yet to extend to the
domain of physics simulation. A primary bottleneck is data scarcity: while
millions of images, videos, and textual resources are readily available on the
internet, the largest physics simulation datasets contain only tens of
thousands of samples. This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as
overfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications
typically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due
to limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or
text-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary
drastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask
training. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for
physics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.
It uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales
into a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token
prediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate
the rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a
specialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that
PhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific
baselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute
state-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that
knowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to
physics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks
enables synergistic learning.

*Dyuman Aditya,Colton Payne,Mario Leiva,Paulo Shakarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PyReason, a framework integrating ML model outputs with temporal logic programming for adaptive decision-making in complex workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between ML model outputs and actionable decisions in complex workflows by leveraging logical reasoning.

Method: Integrates ML model outputs with PyReason, a temporal logic programming engine, converting real-valued outputs into logical facts for dynamic reasoning.

Result: Enables real-time adaptive decision-making with temporal reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and explainable interfaces.

Conclusion: The PyReason-ML integration offers a powerful, transparent system for automating complex processes across domains like manufacturing and healthcare.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) have yielded powerful models
capable of extracting structured information from diverse and complex data
sources. However, a significant challenge lies in translating these perceptual
or extractive outputs into actionable, reasoned decisions within complex
operational workflows. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a
novel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models
directly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming
reasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows
for the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,
confidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals
within its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,
implemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into
logical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine
adaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal
reasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces
enables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing
organizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and
extraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of
PyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.
This integration finds utility across numerous domains, including
manufacturing, healthcare, and business operations.

*Andrei Cristian Nica,Akshaya Vishnu Kudlu Shanbhogue,Harshil Shah,Aleix Cambray,Tudor Berariu,Lucas Maystre,David Barber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UIExplore-Bench is the first benchmark for evaluating UI exploration in autonomous agents, introducing a metric (hUFO) to measure effectiveness. Results show UIExplore-AlGo leads but still lags behind human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic evaluation for UI exploration in autonomous agents, a crucial phase for task solving.

Method: The benchmark evaluates agents in Structured (layout info) or Screen (GUI-only) modes across three levels in a GitLab sandbox, using hUFO to quantify exploration effectiveness.

Result: UIExplore-AlGo achieves 77.2% (Structured) and 59.0% (Screen) of human performance at 2,000 steps, excelling in Sparse level.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals a performance gap between agents and humans, encouraging future research. Resources are released to aid advancements in UI exploration.

Abstract: Autonomous agents must know how to explore user interfaces (UIs) for reliable
task solving, yet systematic evaluation of this crucial phase is lacking. We
introduce UIExplore-Bench, the first benchmark explicitly dedicated to UI
exploration. The benchmark evaluates agents with either Structured mode
(granting access to layout information like DOM trees) or Screen mode (relying
on GUI-only observations such as screenshots and human-like mouse/keyboard
interactions) across three levels in a standardized GitLab sandbox environment.
We formalize exploration as the process of maximizing the set of actionable UI
components discovered and propose a metric, human-normalized UI-Functionalities
Observed (hUFO), to quantify the effectiveness of exploration. Our results show
that UIExplore-AlGo achieves the leading mean hUFO scores, reaching up to 77.2%
of human performance in Structured mode and 59.0% in Screen mode at 2,000
steps, particularly excelling at the Sparse level. The results highlight the
relevance of our benchmark, as current agents show a substantial performance
gap compared to one hour of human expert exploration, indicating ample room for
future advancements. We publicly release the benchmark environment, an
exploration dataset, and an evaluation suite to catalyze research into
efficient UI exploration strategies and their downstream applications, such as
experience-driven task completion and automated training data generation.

### [366] [Beyond instruction-conditioning, MoTE: Mixture of Task Experts for Multi-task Embedding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17781)
*Miguel Romero,Shuoyang Ding,Corey D. Barret,Georgiana Dinu,George Karypis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) to overcome limitations of instruction-conditioning in low-capacity models, achieving significant performance gains without extra costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-conditioning in low-capacity models limits performance gains for embedding specialization. The paper aims to address this.

Method: Proposes MoTE transformer block with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning (TACL) to enhance specialized embeddings.

Result: MoTE achieves 64% higher performance in retrieval datasets and 43% higher gains overall, without additional costs.

Conclusion: MoTE effectively improves embedding specialization in low-capacity models without extra resources.

Abstract: Dense embeddings are fundamental to modern machine learning systems, powering
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), information retrieval, and representation
learning. While instruction-conditioning has become the dominant approach for
embedding specialization, its direct application to low-capacity models imposes
fundamental representational constraints that limit the performance gains
derived from specialization. In this paper, we analyze these limitations and
introduce the Mixture of Task Experts (MoTE) transformer block, which leverages
task-specialized parameters trained with Task-Aware Contrastive Learning
(\tacl) to enhance the model ability to generate specialized embeddings.
Empirical results show that MoTE achieves $64\%$ higher performance gains in
retrieval datasets ($+3.27 \rightarrow +5.21$) and $43\%$ higher performance
gains across all datasets ($+1.81 \rightarrow +2.60$). Critically, these gains
are achieved without altering instructions, training data, inference time, or
number of active parameters.

### [367] [SING: SDE Inference via Natural Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17796)
*Amber Hu,Henry Smith,Scott Linderman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SING (SDE Inference via Natural Gradients) is a variational inference method for latent SDE models, improving convergence and stability by leveraging natural gradients and parallelization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VI methods for latent SDEs suffer from slow convergence and instability, hindering accurate inference in complex dynamical systems.

Method: SING uses natural gradient VI to exploit model geometry, approximates intractable integrals, and parallelizes computations.

Result: SING outperforms prior methods in state inference and drift estimation, demonstrated on datasets including neural dynamics in animals.

Conclusion: SING is a promising tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems with limited prior knowledge.

Abstract: Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for
the unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications
ranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact
posterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,
motivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).
However, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from
slow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via
Natural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to
efficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational
posterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by
approximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We
provide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the
intractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate
that better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift
functions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms
prior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,
including a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely
behaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a
tool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those
characterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative method using diffusion models to produce task-specific neural network parameters directly from task identity, avoiding fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminate the need for task-specific training and labeled data by generating parameters directly.

Method: Use diffusion models to learn and synthesize task-specific parameters from task identifiers.

Result: Effective for seen tasks and multi-task interpolation, but fails for unseen tasks.

Conclusion: Shows potential for generative parameter synthesis but has limitations in generalization.

Abstract: Adapting neural networks to new tasks typically requires task-specific
fine-tuning, which is time-consuming and reliant on labeled data. We explore a
generative alternative that produces task-specific parameters directly from
task identity, eliminating the need for task-specific training. To this end, we
propose using diffusion models to learn the underlying structure of effective
task-specific parameter space and synthesize parameters on demand. Once
trained, the task-conditioned diffusion model can generate specialized weights
directly from task identifiers. We evaluate this approach across three
scenarios: generating parameters for a single seen task, for multiple seen
tasks, and for entirely unseen tasks. Experiments show that diffusion models
can generate accurate task-specific parameters and support multi-task
interpolation when parameter subspaces are well-structured, but fail to
generalize to unseen tasks, highlighting both the potential and limitations of
this generative solution.

*Neta Shoham,Liron Mor-Yosef,Haim Avron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a soft rank measure of the Hessian to assess generalization in neural networks, showing it works well for calibrated models and connects to the Takeuchi Information Criterion for non-calibrated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inconsistency in the relationship between loss curvature (flat vs. sharp minima) and generalization, especially in overparameterized networks.

Method: Introduces a soft rank measure of the Hessian for assessing flatness, validated on calibrated and non-calibrated models.

Result: The measure accurately captures the asymptotic expected generalization gap for calibrated models and connects to Takeuchi Information Criterion for non-calibrated ones.

Conclusion: The proposed flatness measure provides a robust estimate of generalization gaps, outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Recent literature has examined the relationship between the curvature of the
loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of
overparameterized networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to
generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by
empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize
even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral
norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be
assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We
show that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential
family negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error
and its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the
second derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the
asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect
our flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show
that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models
that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach
offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.

### [370] [Actionable Interpretability via Causal Hypergraphs: Unravelling Batch Size Effects in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17826)
*Zhongtian Sun,Anoushka Harit,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HGCNet, a hypergraph-based causal framework, explores how batch size affects generalization in graph and text domains, outperforming baselines like GCN, BERT, and RoBERTa.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the causal mechanisms of batch size on generalization in graph and text domains, which are underexplored compared to vision tasks.

Method: Uses hypergraphs and deep structural causal models (DSCMs) to analyze higher-order interactions and employs do-calculus to quantify batch size effects.

Result: HGCNet outperforms baselines, showing smaller batch sizes improve generalization via increased stochasticity and flatter minima.

Conclusion: The framework provides causally grounded insights for optimization, positioning interpretability as key for principled training strategies.

Abstract: While the impact of batch size on generalisation is well studied in vision
tasks, its causal mechanisms remain underexplored in graph and text domains. We
introduce a hypergraph-based causal framework, HGCNet, that leverages deep
structural causal models (DSCMs) to uncover how batch size influences
generalisation via gradient noise, minima sharpness, and model complexity.
Unlike prior approaches based on static pairwise dependencies, HGCNet employs
hypergraphs to capture higher-order interactions across training dynamics.
Using do-calculus, we quantify direct and mediated effects of batch size
interventions, providing interpretable, causally grounded insights into
optimisation. Experiments on citation networks, biomedical text, and e-commerce
reviews show that HGCNet outperforms strong baselines including GCN, GAT,
PI-GNN, BERT, and RoBERTa. Our analysis reveals that smaller batch sizes
causally enhance generalisation through increased stochasticity and flatter
minima, offering actionable interpretability to guide training strategies in
deep learning. This work positions interpretability as a driver of principled
architectural and optimisation choices beyond post hoc analysis.

### [371] [Aligning Frozen LLMs by Reinforcement Learning: An Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17828)
*Xinnan Zhang,Chenliang Li,Siliang Zeng,Jiaxiang Li,Zhongruo Wang,Kaixiang Lin,Songtao Lu,Alfredo Garcia,Mingyi Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IRO is a reinforcement learning framework for aligning LLMs without modifying model parameters, using iterative sampling and lightweight value functions for test-time guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like RLHF and DPO require model weight updates, limiting their use in test-time or when weights are inaccessible. Test-time methods are costly and rely on imperfect reward functions.

Method: IRO iteratively samples candidates from a frozen base model, resamples using value functions, and trains lightweight value functions to guide decoding. At test time, it optimizes generation via search-based processes.

Result: IRO enables alignment without weight updates, reducing inference costs and improving output quality compared to one-shot guidance methods.

Conclusion: IRO offers a flexible, efficient alternative for aligning LLMs without model weight access, suitable for user-specific datasets.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

TL;DR: Causal-SphHN is a framework for socially grounded prediction, modeling higher-order structure, directional influence, and uncertainty. It outperforms baselines in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of human social behavior, which involves uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics.

Method: Uses hyperspherical embeddings for individuals and hyperedges for groups, with Shannon entropy for uncertainty and Granger-informed subgraphs for causality. Angular message-passing propagates information.

Result: Improves predictive accuracy, robustness, and calibration on datasets like SNARE, PHEME, and AMIGOS. Enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns.

Conclusion: Causal-SphHN provides a unified causal-geometric approach for learning in dynamic social environments.

Abstract: Human social behaviour is governed by complex interactions shaped by
uncertainty, causality, and group dynamics. We propose Causal Spherical
Hypergraph Networks (Causal-SphHN), a principled framework for socially
grounded prediction that jointly models higher-order structure, directional
influence, and epistemic uncertainty. Our method represents individuals as
hyperspherical embeddings and group contexts as hyperedges, capturing semantic
and relational geometry. Uncertainty is quantified via Shannon entropy over von
Mises-Fisher distributions, while temporal causal dependencies are identified
using Granger-informed subgraphs. Information is propagated through an angular
message-passing mechanism that respects belief dispersion and directional
semantics. Experiments on SNARE (offline networks), PHEME (online discourse),
and AMIGOS (multimodal affect) show that Causal-SphHN improves predictive
accuracy, robustness, and calibration over strong baselines. Moreover, it
enables interpretable analysis of influence patterns and social ambiguity. This
work contributes a unified causal-geometric approach for learning under
uncertainty in dynamic social environments.

*Cristian Del Gobbo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study evaluates six synthetic data generators from SDV and Synthicity, finding Bayesian Network (Synthicity) best for fidelity and TVAE (SDV) for predictive tasks. SDV is noted for better usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality training data is essential for ML models but hard to obtain, especially for smaller entities. Synthetic data offers a scalable, privacy-preserving alternative.

Method: Six generators (SDV: Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE; Synthicity: Bayesian Network, CTGAN, TVAE) were tested on a UCI dataset under low-data (1,000 rows) and scaled (10,000 rows) conditions. Evaluated via statistical similarity and predictive utility.

Result: Bayesian Network (Synthicity) excelled in fidelity; TVAE (SDV) in predictive tasks for 1:10 data. SDV was more user-friendly.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generators are viable, with trade-offs between fidelity and utility. SDV is recommended for ease of use.

Abstract: High-quality training data is critical to the performance of machine learning
models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). However, obtaining real,
high-quality data can be challenging, especially for smaller organizations and
early-stage startups. Synthetic data generators provide a promising solution by
replicating the statistical and structural properties of real data while
preserving privacy and scalability. This study evaluates the performance of six
tabular synthetic data generators from two widely used open-source libraries:
SDV (Gaussian Copula, CTGAN, TVAE) and Synthicity (Bayesian Network, CTGAN,
TVAE). Using a real-world dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
comprising energy consumption and environmental variables from Belgium, we
simulate a low-data regime by training models on only 1,000 rows. Each
generator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two
conditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.
Evaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured
via classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,
assessed using a "Train on Synthetic, Test on Real" approach with four
regression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across
models in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.
The Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both
scenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the
1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two
libraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,
making it more accessible for practitioners.

*Suyash Gaurav,Jukka Heikkonen,Jatin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaPI is a novel framework for continual learning that improves energy efficiency and reduces catastrophic forgetting through pathway-based optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dual challenge of catastrophic forgetting and energy efficiency in continual learning, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Introduces Pathway-based Progressive Inference (PaPI), a theoretical framework with pathway selection and adaptation, formulated as an energy-constrained optimization problem.

Result: PaPI achieves an O(K) improvement in stability-plasticity trade-off, tight bounds on forgetting rates, and energy consumption scaling with active parameters.

Conclusion: PaPI outperforms EWC and GEM in theoretical guarantees and energy efficiency, validated by experiments in energy-constrained settings.

Abstract: Continual learning systems face the dual challenge of preventing catastrophic
forgetting while maintaining energy efficiency, particularly in
resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Pathway-based
Progressive Inference (PaPI), a novel theoretical framework that addresses
these challenges through a mathematically rigorous approach to pathway
selection and adaptation. We formulate continual learning as an
energy-constrained optimization problem and provide formal convergence
guarantees for our pathway routing mechanisms. Our theoretical analysis
demonstrates that PaPI achieves an $\mathcal{O}(K)$ improvement in the
stability-plasticity trade-off compared to monolithic architectures, where $K$
is the number of pathways. We derive tight bounds on forgetting rates using
Fisher Information Matrix analysis and prove that PaPI's energy consumption
scales with the number of active parameters rather than the total model size.
Comparative theoretical analysis shows that PaPI provides stronger guarantees
against catastrophic forgetting than Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) while
maintaining better energy efficiency than both EWC and Gradient Episodic Memory
(GEM). Our experimental validation confirms these theoretical advantages across
multiple benchmarks, demonstrating PaPI's effectiveness for continual learning
in energy-constrained settings. Our codes are available at

*Daniel Wurgaft,Ekdeep Singh Lubana,Core Francisco Park,Hidenori Tanaka,Gautam Reddy,Noah D. Goodman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper unifies in-context learning (ICL) strategies by explaining them through a Bayesian framework, linking model behavior to tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why models learn diverse ICL strategies when trained on mixed tasks, and to provide a predictive framework grounded in Bayesian principles.

Method: Develops a hierarchical Bayesian framework to predict Transformer behavior without accessing weights, viewing pretraining as updating posterior probabilities of strategies.

Result: The framework accurately predicts model behavior, explaining ICL phenomena and predicting trends like superlinear memorization transition timescales.

Conclusion: The work offers a unified, predictive account of ICL, emphasizing tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

Abstract: Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of
strategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.
We aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate
strategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that
when trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the
strategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of
Bayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on
the set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches
the underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from
cognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal
adaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical
Bayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token
predictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under
this framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior
probability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a
posterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework
draws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make
explicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:
beyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing
a strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL
phenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend
in the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.
Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL
grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.

### [376] [NestQuant: Post-Training Integer-Nesting Quantization for On-Device DNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17870)
*Jianhang Xie,Chuntao Ding,Xiaqing Li,Shenyuan Ren,Yidong Li,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NestQuant introduces a resource-friendly post-training quantization method for IoT devices, enabling dynamic model switching without retraining or special hardware, reducing storage and switching overheads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods lack adaptability to dynamic IoT resources and require multiple models, increasing storage and switching costs.

Method: NestQuant uses integer weight decomposition and nesting to optimize higher-bit weights, allowing dynamic switching between full-bit and part-bit models.

Result: NestQuant achieves high accuracy (e.g., 78.1% for ResNet-101) and reduces switching overheads by ~78.1% compared to traditional PTQ.

Conclusion: NestQuant provides an efficient, adaptable solution for deploying quantized DNNs on IoT devices, balancing performance and resource constraints.

Abstract: Deploying quantized deep neural network (DNN) models with resource adaptation
capabilities on ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide
high-quality AI services can leverage the benefits of compression and meet
multi-scenario resource requirements. However, existing dynamic/mixed precision
quantization requires retraining or special hardware, whereas post-training
quantization (PTQ) has two limitations for resource adaptation: (i) The
state-of-the-art PTQ methods only provide one fixed bitwidth model, which makes
it challenging to adapt to the dynamic resources of IoT devices; (ii) Deploying
multiple PTQ models with diverse bitwidths consumes large storage resources and
switching overheads. To this end, this paper introduces a resource-friendly
post-training integer-nesting quantization, i.e., NestQuant, for on-device
quantized model switching on IoT devices. The proposed NestQuant incorporates
the integer weight decomposition, which bit-wise splits quantized weights into
higher-bit and lower-bit weights of integer data types. It also contains a
decomposed weights nesting mechanism to optimize the higher-bit weights by
adaptive rounding and nest them into the original quantized weights. In
deployment, we can send and store only one NestQuant model and switch between
the full-bit/part-bit model by paging in/out lower-bit weights to adapt to
resource changes and reduce consumption. Experimental results on the
ImageNet-1K pretrained DNNs demonstrated that the NestQuant model can achieve
high performance in top-1 accuracy, and reduce in terms of data transmission,
storage consumption, and switching overheads. In particular, the ResNet-101
with INT8 nesting INT6 can achieve 78.1% and 77.9% accuracy for full-bit and
part-bit models, respectively, and reduce switching overheads by approximately
78.1% compared with diverse bitwidths PTQ models.

*Sree Bhargavi Balija,Amitash Nanda,Debashis Sahoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedNAM+ is a federated learning framework integrating Neural Additive Models and conformal prediction for interpretable, reliable uncertainty estimation, validated on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing federated learning frameworks lack solutions combining uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and robustness.

Method: FedNAM+ integrates Neural Additive Models with a novel conformal prediction method, using gradient-based sensitivity maps for interpretability and uncertainty estimation.

Result: High prediction accuracy (e.g., 0.1% loss on MNIST) with transparent uncertainty measures, outperforming methods like Monte Carlo Dropout.

Conclusion: FedNAM+ enhances trust and transparency in decentralized predictive modeling with robustness, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning has significantly advanced distributed training of machine
learning models across decentralized data sources. However, existing frameworks
often lack comprehensive solutions that combine uncertainty quantification,
interpretability, and robustness. To address this, we propose FedNAM+, a
federated learning framework that integrates Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with
a novel conformal prediction method to enable interpretable and reliable
uncertainty estimation. Our method introduces a dynamic level adjustment
technique that utilizes gradient-based sensitivity maps to identify key input
features influencing predictions. This facilitates both interpretability and
pixel-wise uncertainty estimates. Unlike traditional interpretability methods
such as LIME and SHAP, which do not provide confidence intervals, FedNAM+
offers visual insights into prediction reliability. We validate our approach
through experiments on CT scan, MNIST, and CIFAR datasets, demonstrating high
prediction accuracy with minimal loss (e.g., only 0.1% on MNIST), along with
transparent uncertainty measures. Visual analysis highlights variable
uncertainty intervals, revealing low-confidence regions where model performance
can be improved with additional data. Compared to Monte Carlo Dropout, FedNAM+
delivers efficient and global uncertainty estimates with reduced computational
overhead, making it particularly suitable for federated learning scenarios.
Overall, FedNAM+ provides a robust, interpretable, and computationally
efficient framework that enhances trust and transparency in decentralized
predictive modeling.

### [378] [Choice of Scoring Rules for Indirect Elicitation of Properties with Parametric Assumptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17880)
*Lingfang Hu,Ian A. Kash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores indirect elicitation of statistical properties using parametric assumptions, focusing on how weight choices in scoring rules affect property estimation, with optimal weights often being zero.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of literature on choosing proper scoring rules for applications, particularly when the target property is a function of sub-properties.

Method: Uses simulation studies and theoretical analysis, including a framework for two and more sub-properties, and linear approximations for higher dimensions.

Result: Optimal estimation often involves setting some weights to zero, with theoretical support for 2-D cases and linear approximations for higher dimensions.

Conclusion: The choice of weights significantly impacts estimation, with zero weights often optimal, supported by theory and simulations.

Abstract: People are commonly interested in predicting a statistical property of a
random event such as mean and variance. Proper scoring rules assess the quality
of predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at
the precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the
property. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the
characterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little
literature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at
hand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of
properties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function
of several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted
sum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction
to a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to
different constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the
choice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which
choice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an
interesting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target
property changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best
configuration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand
how it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and
then provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties
and of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly
interprets the experimental results. In higher-dimensional situations, we
especially study the linear cases and suggest that more complex settings can be
understood with locally mapping into linear situations or using linear
approximations when the true values of sub-properties are close enough to the
parametric space.

*Kiran Thorat,Amit Hasan,Caiwen Ding,Zhijie Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel GNN-based framework for detecting hardware trojans in large chip designs, achieving high precision and recall with efficient training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of untrusted third-party IPs and tools in chip manufacturing raises the risk of hardware trojans, posing threats to security and privacy. Existing GNN-based methods perform poorly on larger designs and lack efficient training processes.

Method: The framework generates graph embeddings for large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates tailored GNN models. It uses model quantization for efficient training and inference, reducing computational requirements without significant accuracy loss.

Result: Achieved 98.66% precision and 92.30% recall on a custom dataset, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting hardware trojans in large-scale designs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses limitations of existing methods, offering an efficient and accurate solution for hardware trojan detection in large chip designs.

Abstract: Chip manufacturing is a complex process, and to achieve a faster time to
market, an increasing number of untrusted third-party tools and designs from
around the world are being utilized. The use of these untrusted third party
intellectual properties (IPs) and tools increases the risk of adversaries
inserting hardware trojans (HTs). The covert nature of HTs poses significant
threats to cyberspace, potentially leading to severe consequences for national
security, the economy, and personal privacy. Many graph neural network
(GNN)-based HT detection methods have been proposed. However, they perform
poorly on larger designs because they rely on training with smaller designs.
Additionally, these methods do not explore different GNN models that are
well-suited for HT detection or provide efficient training and inference
processes. We propose a novel framework that generates graph embeddings for
large designs (e.g., RISC-V) and incorporates various GNN models tailored for
HT detection. Furthermore, our framework introduces domain-specific techniques
for efficient training and inference by implementing model quantization. Model
quantization reduces the precision of the weights, lowering the computational
requirements, enhancing processing speed without significantly affecting
detection accuracy. We evaluate our framework using a custom dataset, and our
results demonstrate a precision of 98.66% and a recall (true positive rate) of
92.30%, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in
detecting hardware trojans in large-scale chip designs

### [380] [Permutation Equivariant Model-based Offline Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17919)
*Zhiyu Mou,Miao Xu,Wei Chen,Rongquan Bai,Chuan Yu,Jian Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB) to bridge the gap between simulation and real-world data in auto-bidding, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (SRLB and ORLB) have limitations: ORLB lacks state coverage, while SRLB suffers from a simulator-reality gap. MRLB aims to address these issues.

Method: MRLB learns an environment model from real data and trains policies using both real and model-generated data. It includes a permutation equivariant model and robust offline Q-learning (PE-MORL algorithm).

Result: PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: MRLB, with its PE-MORL algorithm, effectively bridges the simulator-reality gap and improves auto-bidding performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for auto-bidding has shifted from using
simplistic offline simulators (Simulation-based RL Bidding, SRLB) to offline RL
on fixed real datasets (Offline RL Bidding, ORLB). However, ORLB policies are
limited by the dataset's state space coverage, offering modest gains. While
SRLB expands state coverage, its simulator-reality gap risks misleading
policies. This paper introduces Model-based RL Bidding (MRLB), which learns an
environment model from real data to bridge this gap. MRLB trains policies using
both real and model-generated data, expanding state coverage beyond ORLB. To
ensure model reliability, we propose: 1) A permutation equivariant model
architecture for better generalization, and 2) A robust offline Q-learning
method that pessimistically penalizes model errors. These form the Permutation
Equivariant Model-based Offline RL (PE-MORL) algorithm. Real-world experiments
show that PE-MORL outperforms state-of-the-art auto-bidding methods.

*Shulun Chen,Wei Shao,Flora D. Salim,Hao Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASTER is a model that bridges spatio-temporal forecasting with actionable decision-making, improving resource allocation and intervention strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work decouples prediction from decision-making, reducing efficiency. ASTER aims to integrate forecasting with actionable strategies, especially in emergency response.

Method: ASTER uses a Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal module (RaST) for dynamic dependencies and a Preference-oriented decision agent (Poda) for multi-objective reinforcement learning.

Result: ASTER achieves state-of-the-art performance in early prediction accuracy and resource allocation across six metrics on four datasets.

Conclusion: ASTER successfully transforms forecasting into actionable decisions, enhancing overall effectiveness in spatio-temporal intelligence.

Abstract: Supporting decision-making has long been a central vision in the field of
spatio-temporal intelligence. While prior work has improved the timeliness and
accuracy of spatio-temporal forecasting, converting these forecasts into
actionable strategies remains a key challenge. A main limitation is the
decoupling of the prediction and the downstream decision phases, which can
significantly degrade the downstream efficiency. For example, in emergency
response, the priority is successful resource allocation and intervention, not
just incident prediction. To this end, it is essential to propose an Adaptive
Spatio-Temporal Early Decision model (ASTER) that reforms the forecasting
paradigm from event anticipation to actionable decision support. This framework
ensures that information is directly used for decision-making, thereby
maximizing overall effectiveness. Specifically, ASTER introduces a new
Resource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively
captures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,
producing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate
actionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent
(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms
predictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving
optimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.
Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction
accuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics.

TL;DR: A novel entropy-optimizing framework for Boltzmann machines reduces costs and over-confidence, outperforming state-of-the-art AI in performance, cost, and model simplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high costs and over-confidence of current AI models by developing a more efficient and reliable learning framework.

Method: Introduces a gradient-descent-free, entropy-optimizing reformulation of Boltzmann machines using the exact law of total probability.

Result: Produces performant, cost-effective models with justified confidence measures, outperforming existing tools in synthetic and climate prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The framework offers a mathematically sound, efficient alternative to current AI models, with applications in complex problems like climate prediction.

Abstract: Progress of AI has led to a creation of very successful, but by no means
humble models and tools, especially regarding (i) the huge and further
exploding costs and resources they demand, and (ii) the over-confidence of
these tools with the answers they provide. Here we introduce a novel
mathematical framework for a non-equilibrium entropy-optimizing reformulation
of Boltzmann machines based on the exact law of total probability. It results
in the highly-performant, but much cheaper, gradient-descent-free learning
framework with mathematically-justified existence and uniqueness criteria, and
answer confidence/reliability measures. Comparisons to state-of-the-art AI
tools in terms of performance, cost and the model descriptor lengths on a set
of synthetic problems with varying complexity reveal that the proposed method
results in more performant and slim models, with the descriptor lengths being
very close to the intrinsic complexity scaling bounds for the underlying
problems. Applying this framework to historical climate data results in models
with systematically higher prediction skills for the onsets of La Ni\~na and El
Ni\~no climate phenomena, requiring just few years of climate data for training
- a small fraction of what is necessary for contemporary climate prediction
tools.

*Mariya Hendriksen,Tabish Rashid,David Bignell,Raluca Georgescu,Abdelhak Lemkhenter,Katja Hofmann,Sam Devlin,Sarah Parisot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces UNIVERSE, a method for adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to evaluate world model rollouts, addressing challenges in fine-grained, temporally sensitive assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to capture fine-grained, temporally grounded evaluation of world model rollouts, necessitating a new approach leveraging VLMs.

Method: UNIVERSE adapts VLMs for rollout evaluation, focusing on action and character recognition tasks across binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended formats. It compares full, partial, and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Result: UNIVERSE matches task-specific baselines with a single checkpoint and aligns well with human judgments.

Conclusion: UNIVERSE is a scalable, semantics-aware evaluator for world models, validated by human studies.

Abstract: World models -- generative models that simulate environment dynamics
conditioned on past observations and actions -- are gaining prominence in
planning, simulation, and embodied AI. However, evaluating their rollouts
remains a fundamental challenge, requiring fine-grained, temporally grounded
assessment of action alignment and semantic consistency -- capabilities not
captured by existing metrics. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise
as automatic evaluators of generative content due to their strong multimodal
reasoning abilities. Yet, their use in fine-grained, temporally sensitive
evaluation tasks remains limited and requires targeted adaptation. We introduce
a evaluation protocol targeting two recognition tasks -- action recognition and
character recognition -- each assessed across binary, multiple-choice, and
open-ended formats. To support this, we present UNIVERSE (UNIfied
Vision-language Evaluator for Rollouts in Simulated Environments), a method for
adapting VLMs to rollout evaluation under data and compute constraints. We
conduct a large-scale study comparing full, partial, and parameter-efficient
finetuning across task formats, context lengths, sampling strategies, and data
compositions. The resulting unified evaluator matches the performance of
task-specific baselines using a single checkpoint. Human studies confirm strong
alignment with human judgments, establishing UNIVERSE as a scalable,
semantics-aware evaluator for world models.

*Wenjian Huang,Guiping Cao,Jiahao Xia,Jingkun Chen,Hao Wang,Jianguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses miscalibration in deep neural networks, proposing a probabilistic framework (h-calibration) to improve calibration without sacrificing performance. It identifies limitations in existing methods and demonstrates superior results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often produce unreliable probability outputs due to miscalibration, prompting the need for effective recalibration methods.

Method: The study categorizes existing recalibration methods into three strategies, identifies their limitations, and introduces h-calibration, a probabilistic framework with a post-hoc algorithm.

Result: The proposed h-calibration method outperforms traditional approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The h-calibration framework provides a theoretically sound and practical solution for reliable probability outputs, advancing calibration in deep learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance across numerous
learning tasks but often suffer from miscalibration, resulting in unreliable
probability outputs. This has inspired many recent works on mitigating
miscalibration, particularly through post-hoc recalibration methods that aim to
obtain calibrated probabilities without sacrificing the classification
performance of pre-trained models. In this study, we summarize and categorize
previous works into three general strategies: intuitively designed methods,
binning-based methods, and methods based on formulations of ideal calibration.
Through theoretical and practical analysis, we highlight ten common limitations
in previous approaches. To address these limitations, we propose a
probabilistic learning framework for calibration called h-calibration, which
theoretically constructs an equivalent learning formulation for canonical
calibration with boundedness. On this basis, we design a simple yet effective
post-hoc calibration algorithm. Our method not only overcomes the ten
identified limitations but also achieves markedly better performance than
traditional methods, as validated by extensive experiments. We further analyze,
both theoretically and experimentally, the relationship and advantages of our
learning objective compared to traditional proper scoring rule. In summary, our
probabilistic framework derives an approximately equivalent differentiable
objective for learning error-bounded calibrated probabilities, elucidating the
correspondence and convergence properties of computational statistics with
respect to theoretical bounds in canonical calibration. The theoretical
effectiveness is verified on standard post-hoc calibration benchmarks by
achieving state-of-the-art performance. This research offers valuable reference
for learning reliable likelihood in related fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high communication overhead in distributed training and enhance resistance to gradient inversion attacks.

Method: Incorporates low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques into PowerSGD for efficient gradient compression.

Result: Reduces communication overhead significantly without compromising training convergence or model accuracy.

Conclusion: LQ-SGD offers a robust and efficient optimization solution for distributed learning systems.

Abstract: We propose LQ-SGD (Low-Rank Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent), an
efficient communication gradient compression algorithm designed for distributed
training. LQ-SGD further develops on the basis of PowerSGD by incorporating the
low-rank approximation and log-quantization techniques, which drastically
reduce the communication overhead, while still ensuring the convergence speed
of training and model accuracy. In addition, LQ-SGD and other compression-based
methods show stronger resistance to gradient inversion than traditional SGD,
providing a more robust and efficient optimization path for distributed
learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SliceGX is a novel GNN explanation method that provides layer-wise insights into model behavior, improving diagnosis and optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GNN explanation methods lack finer-grained, layer-wise analysis, which is crucial for model diagnosis and architecture optimization.

Method: SliceGX segments GNNs into layer blocks and identifies explanatory subgraphs for each block, using efficient algorithms with approximation guarantees.

Result: SliceGX effectively generates layer-wise explanations and supports model debugging, as validated by experiments on real-world graphs.

Conclusion: SliceGX advances GNN explainability by offering progressive, layer-wise insights and practical utility in model debugging.

Abstract: Ensuring the trustworthiness of graph neural networks (GNNs) as black-box
models requires effective explanation methods. Existing GNN explanations
typically apply input perturbations to identify subgraphs that are responsible
for the occurrence of the final output of GNNs. However, such approaches lack
finer-grained, layer-wise analysis of how intermediate representations
contribute to the final result, capabilities that are crucial for model
diagnosis and architecture optimization. This paper introduces SliceGX, a novel
GNN explanation approach that generates explanations at specific GNN layers in
a progressive manner. Given a GNN M, a set of selected intermediate layers, and
a target layer, SliceGX automatically segments M into layer blocks ("model
slice") and discovers high-quality explanatory subgraphs in each layer block
that clarifies the occurrence of output of M at the targeted layer. Although
finding such layer-wise explanations is computationally challenging, we develop
efficient algorithms and optimization techniques that incrementally generate
and maintain these subgraphs with provable approximation guarantees.
Additionally, SliceGX offers a SPARQL-like query interface, providing
declarative access and search capacities for the generated explanations.
Through experiments on large real-world graphs and representative GNN
architectures, we verify the effectiveness and efficiency of SliceGX, and
illustrate its practical utility in supporting model debugging.

*Lucas Mattioli,Youness Ait Hadichou,Sabrina Chaouche,Martin Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) from raw tabular data causes model collapse, where predictions converge to a single class. Metrics introduced reveal TE quality's impact on downstream learning and expose spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the failure mode of model collapse when using uncurated TEs and assess their effectiveness as a curation layer.

Method: Compare models trained on raw tabular data and TE-derived counterparts using identical hyper-parameters, and introduce metrics to quantify model collapse.

Result: Model collapse is consistent with TEs, and their quality significantly affects learning. TE alone fails as a curation layer, and collapse can inflate accuracy correlations.

Conclusion: Nuanced curation and evaluation of embedding-based representations are crucial, especially in out-of-distribution settings.

Abstract: Training models on uncurated Text Embeddings (TEs) derived from raw tabular
data can lead to a severe failure mode known as model collapse, where
predictions converge to a single class regardless of input. By comparing models
trained with identical hyper-parameter configurations on both raw tabular data
and their TE-derived counterparts, we find that collapse is a consistent
failure mode in the latter setting. We introduce a set of metrics that capture
the extent of model collapse, offering a new perspective on TE quality as a
proxy for data curation. Our results reveal that TE alone does not effectively
function as a curation layer - and that their quality significantly influences
downstream learning. More insidiously, we observe that the presence of model
collapse can yield artificially inflated and spurious Accuracy-on-the-Line
correlation. These findings highlight the need for more nuanced curation and
evaluation of embedding-based representations, particularly in
out-of-distribution settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reviews GANs in Longitudinal Data Imputation (LDI) for Classification (LDC), highlighting their potential but noting gaps in handling data challenges like missing values, class imbalance, and mixed data types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal data's complexity (multi-dimensionality, temporal correlations, missing values) and its impact on LDC accuracy motivate exploring GANs for LDI.

Method: The paper categorizes GAN-based LDI approaches, evaluates their strengths/limitations, and identifies research trends.

Result: GANs show promise for LDI but lack versatility in addressing all longitudinal data challenges.

Conclusion: Future research should develop more adaptable GAN-based solutions to improve LDC by better handling longitudinal data complexities.

Abstract: Longitudinal data is commonly utilised across various domains, such as
health, biomedical, education and survey studies. This ubiquity has led to a
rise in statistical, machine and deep learning-based methods for Longitudinal
Data Classification (LDC). However, the intricate nature of the data,
characterised by its multi-dimensionality, causes instance-level heterogeneity
and temporal correlations that add to the complexity of longitudinal data
analysis. Additionally, LDC accuracy is often hampered by the pervasiveness of
missing values in longitudinal data. Despite ongoing research that draw on the
generative power and utility of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to
address the missing data problem, critical considerations include statistical
assumptions surrounding longitudinal data and missingness within it, as well as
other data-level challenges like class imbalance and mixed data types that
impact longitudinal data imputation (LDI) and the subsequent LDC process in
GANs. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of how GANs have been
applied in LDI, with a focus whether GANS have adequately addressed fundamental
assumptions about the data from a LDC perspective. We propose a categorisation
of main approaches to GAN-based LDI, highlight strengths and limitations of
methods, identify key research trends, and provide promising future directions.
Our findings indicate that while GANs show great potential for LDI to improve
usability and quality of longitudinal data for tasks like LDC, there is need
for more versatile approaches that can handle the wider spectrum of challenges
presented by longitudinal data with missing values. By synthesising current
knowledge and identifying critical research gaps, this survey aims to guide
future research efforts in developing more effective GAN-based solutions to
address LDC challenges.

TL;DR: The paper explores how token perturbations affect Transformer models' embedding space, showing rare tokens cause larger shifts and deeper layers mix input information more. It validates using early layers for explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how information propagates in Transformers and assess the impact of minimal token perturbations on embeddings.

Method: Analyzed token perturbations and their effects on embedding shifts, focusing on token rarity and layer-wise propagation.

Result: Rare tokens cause larger embedding shifts, and deeper layers increasingly intermix input information. Early layers are reliable for explanations.

Conclusion: Token perturbations and embedding shifts are effective for Transformer interpretability, supporting the use of early layers in explanations.

Abstract: Understanding how information propagates through Transformer models is a key
challenge for interpretability. In this work, we study the effects of minimal
token perturbations on the embedding space. In our experiments, we analyze the
frequency of which tokens yield to minimal shifts, highlighting that rare
tokens usually lead to larger shifts. Moreover, we study how perturbations
propagate across layers, demonstrating that input information is increasingly
intermixed in deeper layers. Our findings validate the common assumption that
the first layers of a model can be used as proxies for model explanations.
Overall, this work introduces the combination of token perturbations and shifts
on the embedding space as a powerful tool for model interpretability.

*Thomas Boudou,Batiste Le Bars,Nirupam Gupta,AurÃ©lien Bellet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates the impact of Byzantine and data poisoning attacks on generalization in robust distributed learning, showing Byzantine attacks are more harmful.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the fundamental differences in generalization error between Byzantine and data poisoning attacks in distributed learning.

Method: Theoretical analysis of uniform algorithmic stability under both threat models, comparing degradation factors.

Result: Byzantine attacks degrade stability more severely ($\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{f}{n-2f}})$) than data poisoning ($\Theta(\frac{f}{n-f})$).

Conclusion: Byzantine attacks are intrinsically more harmful to generalization, especially as the number of misbehaving workers increases.

Abstract: Robust distributed learning algorithms aim to maintain good performance in
distributed and federated settings, even in the presence of misbehaving
workers. Two primary threat models have been studied: Byzantine attacks, where
misbehaving workers can send arbitrarily corrupted updates, and data poisoning
attacks, where misbehavior is limited to manipulation of local training data.
While prior work has shown comparable optimization error under both threat
models, a fundamental question remains open: How do these threat models impact
generalization? Empirical evidence suggests a gap between the two threat
models, yet it remains unclear whether it is fundamental or merely an artifact
of suboptimal attacks. In this work, we present the first theoretical
investigation into this problem, formally showing that Byzantine attacks are
intrinsically more harmful to generalization than data poisoning. Specifically,
we prove that: (i) under data poisoning, the uniform algorithmic stability of a
robust distributed learning algorithm, with optimal optimization error,
degrades by an additive factor of $\varTheta ( \frac{f}{n-f} )$, with $f$ the
number of misbehaving workers out of $n$; and (ii) In contrast, under Byzantine
attacks, the degradation is in $\mathcal{O} \big( \sqrt{ \frac{f}{n-2f}}
\big)$.This difference in stability leads to a generalization error gap that is
especially significant as $f$ approaches its maximum value $\frac{n}{2}$.

*Abhay Sheshadri,John Hughes,Julian Michael,Alex Mallen,Arun Jose,Janus,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes alignment faking in 25 LLMs, finding only 5 models (Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply more with harmful queries in training than deployment. Claude 3 Opus's behavior is uniquely motivated by goal retention. Post-training impacts alignment faking, with refusal behavior variations explaining differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why some LLMs fake alignment (selectively comply with training objectives) and how post-training affects this behavior.

Method: Analyzed 25 models, perturbed scenario details, and investigated hypotheses about post-training's role in suppressing alignment faking.

Result: Only 5 models showed alignment faking. Claude 3 Opus's behavior was consistently goal-motivated. Post-training varied in suppressing or amplifying alignment faking, with refusal behavior as a key factor.

Conclusion: Alignment faking is model-specific and influenced by post-training. Understanding refusal behavior is crucial for mitigating undesired compliance gaps.

Abstract: Alignment faking in large language models presented a demonstration of Claude
3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively complying with a helpful-only training
objective to prevent modification of their behavior outside of training. We
expand this analysis to 25 models and find that only 5 (Claude 3 Opus, Claude
3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3 405B, Grok 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash) comply with harmful queries
more when they infer they are in training than when they infer they are in
deployment. First, we study the motivations of these 5 models. Results from
perturbing details of the scenario suggest that only Claude 3 Opus's compliance
gap is primarily and consistently motivated by trying to keep its goals.
Second, we investigate why many chat models don't fake alignment. Our results
suggest this is not entirely due to a lack of capabilities: many base models
fake alignment some of the time, and post-training eliminates alignment-faking
for some models and amplifies it for others. We investigate 5 hypotheses for
how post-training may suppress alignment faking and find that variations in
refusal behavior may account for a significant portion of differences in
alignment faking.

*Seongwoo Lim,Won Jo,Joohyung Lee,Jaesik Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for explaining neural network decisions by focusing on subsets of hidden units in the decision-making path, offering clearer and more consistent insights than previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of transparency and reliability in neural networks by providing more interpretable explanations of their decision-making processes.

Method: Introduces a pathwise explanation approach that analyzes subsets of hidden units involved in decisions, allowing flexible and detailed input attributions.

Result: Outperforms existing methods quantitatively and qualitatively in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances interpretability and reliability of neural networks by providing clearer, more consistent, and flexible explanations.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated a wide range of successes, but their
``black box" nature raises concerns about transparency and reliability.
Previous research on ReLU networks has sought to unwrap these networks into
linear models based on activation states of all hidden units. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that considers subsets of the hidden units involved
in the decision making path. This pathwise explanation provides a clearer and
more consistent understanding of the relationship between the input and the
decision-making process. Our method also offers flexibility in adjusting the
range of explanations within the input, i.e., from an overall attribution input
to particular components within the input. Furthermore, it allows for the
decomposition of explanations for a given input for more detailed explanations.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms others both quantitatively
and qualitatively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TAB, a new benchmark for time series anomaly detection (TSAD), addressing evaluation deficiencies by providing diverse datasets, unified evaluation protocols, and comprehensive method coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TSAD evaluation methods lack reliability due to inconsistent datasets and protocols, hindering progress in developing better anomaly detection methods.

Method: TAB includes 29 multivariate and 1,635 univariate datasets, covers various TSAD methods (Non-learning, ML, DL, LLM-based, pre-trained), and features a unified automated evaluation pipeline.

Result: TAB enables fair and comprehensive evaluation of TSAD methods, offering insights into their performance across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: TAB serves as a robust benchmark for TSAD, facilitating better method development and comparison, with all resources publicly available.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays an important role in many domains
such as finance, transportation, and healthcare. With the ongoing
instrumentation of reality, more time series data will be available, leading
also to growing demands for TSAD. While many TSAD methods already exist, new
and better methods are still desirable. However, effective progress hinges on
the availability of reliable means of evaluating new methods and comparing them
with existing methods. We address deficiencies in current evaluation procedures
related to datasets and experimental settings and protocols. Specifically, we
propose a new time series anomaly detection benchmark, called TAB. First, TAB
encompasses 29 public multivariate datasets and 1,635 univariate time series
from different domains to facilitate more comprehensive evaluations on diverse
datasets. Second, TAB covers a variety of TSAD methods, including Non-learning,
Machine learning, Deep learning, LLM-based, and Time-series pre-trained
methods. Third, TAB features a unified and automated evaluation pipeline that
enables fair and easy evaluation of TSAD methods. Finally, we employ TAB to
evaluate existing TSAD methods and report on the outcomes, thereby offering a
deeper insight into the performance of these methods. Besides, all datasets and
code are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TAB.

TL;DR: Meta learning with distributionally robust optimization improves performance in worst-case scenarios for system identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard meta learning overlooks task variability; this work aims to enhance performance in worst-case scenarios.

Method: Uses distributionally robust optimization to prioritize high-loss tasks, evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems.

Result: Reduces failures in safety-critical applications, tested in in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: The approach enhances robustness in meta learning for system identification, particularly in worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Meta learning aims at learning how to solve tasks, and thus it allows to
estimate models that can be quickly adapted to new scenarios. This work
explores distributionally robust minimization in meta learning for system
identification. Standard meta learning approaches optimize the expected loss,
overlooking task variability. We use an alternative approach, adopting a
distributionally robust optimization paradigm that prioritizes high-loss tasks,
enhancing performance in worst-case scenarios. Evaluated on a meta model
trained on a class of synthetic dynamical systems and tested in both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, the proposed approach allows
to reduce failures in safety-critical applications.

*Mohammad Hossein Amani,Aryo Lotfi,Nicolas Mario Baldwin,Samy Bengio,Mehrdad Farajtabar,Emmanuel Abbe,Robert West*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces AdaBack, a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm for reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert demonstrations, addressing challenges in complex sequence generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) requires costly dense labels, while RL struggles with sparse rewards and large output spaces. The paper explores an intermediate regime between SFT and RL.

Method: AdaBack dynamically adjusts supervision length per sample based on past reward signals, enabling incremental learning of reasoning chains.

Result: AdaBack successfully solves synthetic tasks with latent dependencies and improves performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k).

Conclusion: Per-sample curriculum learning bridges gaps between SFT and RL, enabling generalization in tasks with long latent dependencies.

Abstract: We propose that reinforcement learning (RL) from partial expert
demonstrations is not merely a training heuristic, but a promising framework
for solving complex sequence generation tasks. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
relies on dense ground-truth labels, which become increasingly costly as
sequence length grows. RL, on the other hand, struggles with sparse rewards and
a combinatorially large output space. We address this by introducing adaptive
backtracking (AdaBack), a per-sample curriculum learning algorithm that reveals
only a partial prefix of the target output during training. The supervision
length is adjusted dynamically for each sample based on the model's past reward
signal, allowing it to incrementally learn to complete reasoning chains by
conditioning on correct partial solutions. We investigate this intermediate
regime between SFT and RL and argue that per-sample curriculum learning is more
than a trade-off between efficiency and generality, it can succeed in tasks
with long sequences of latent dependencies where SFT and RL both fail to
generalize. Using a synthetic task with latent parity constraints, we show that
our adaptive curriculum over partial answers reliably solves problems that are
otherwise intractable. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks (MATH, GSM8k), we
find that curriculum learning enables models to solve problems that RL alone
cannot, acquiring new reasoning capabilities through incremental exposure to
partial solutions.

*Shaoxiu Wei,Mingchao Liang,Florian Meyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid method combining model-based Bayesian MOT with neural networks improves performance by enhancing simplistic statistical models, achieving state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MOT methods (model-based or data-driven) have limitations; integrating both could leverage their strengths for better performance.

Method: Neural networks enhance Bayesian MOT's statistical model, using belief propagation and sequential Monte Carlo for efficient computation.

Result: The hybrid method outperforms existing approaches, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: The framework successfully merges model-based flexibility with data-driven learning, offering robust and high-performing MOT.

Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including
autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT
methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data
association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully
data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer
distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods
are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven
MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for
training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can
integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that
utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model
in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so,
the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved.
To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid
high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to
perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines
the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to
learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving
dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance

*Zheng Zhan,Liliang Ren,Shuohang Wang,Liyuan Liu,Yang Liu,Yeyun Gong,Yanzhi Wang,Yelong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoM (Routing Mamba) scales SSMs efficiently using sparse mixtures of linear projection experts, outperforming dense Mamba models with fewer active parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, especially with MoE, is challenging due to performance degradation in naive integration attempts.

Method: RoM introduces sparse mixtures of linear projection experts, sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight sub-modules within Mamba.

Result: At 1.3B active parameters, RoM matches dense Mamba performance (requiring 2.3x more parameters) and saves 23% FLOPS.

Conclusion: RoM effectively scales SSMs, offering a robust alternative to dense models for long sequence modeling.

Abstract: Linear State Space Models (SSMs) offer remarkable performance gains in
efficient sequence modeling, with constant inference-time computation and
memory complexity. Recent advances, such as Mamba, further enhance SSMs with
input-dependent gating and hardware-aware implementations, positioning them as
strong alternatives to Transformers for long sequence modeling. However,
efficiently scaling the expressive power of SSMs, particularly with Mixture of
Experts (MoE), remains challenging, as naive integration attempts often falter
or degrade performance. In this work, we introduce Routing Mamba (RoM), a novel
approach that scales SSM parameters using sparse mixtures of linear projection
experts. By sharing routing decisions between projection layers and lightweight
sub-modules within Mamba across experts, RoM leverages synergies among linear
projection experts for effective and efficient sparse scaling of Mamba layers.
At a scale of 1.3B active parameters (10B total) and 16K training sequence
length, RoM achieves language modeling performance equivalent to a dense Mamba
model requiring over 2.3x more active parameters, and demonstrates consistent
perplexity across context lengths. Experimental results further show RoM
effectively scales hybrid language models, yielding a 23% FLOPS saving compared
to dense Mamba scaling for similar performance.

### [398] [Probabilistic and reinforced mining of association rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18155)
*Yongchao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces four novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods for association rule mining (ARM), offering advantages over traditional frequency-based approaches by incorporating prior knowledge, uncertainty modeling, and adaptive strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ARM methods like Apriori and FP-Growth lack flexibility in handling uncertainty, prior knowledge, and adaptive exploration. The new methods aim to address these limitations.

Method: Four methods are proposed: GPAR (Gaussian process-based), BARM (Bayesian), MAB-ARM (multi-armed bandit), and RLAR (reinforcement learning). Each leverages probabilistic or adaptive techniques for improved ARM.

Result: Empirical results show effectiveness in discovering rare or complex patterns, especially in small datasets, though with trade-offs in computational complexity and interpretability.

Conclusion: The methods represent a shift from static, frequency-driven ARM, offering scalable, uncertainty-aware frameworks suitable for diverse domains like retail, finance, and healthcare.

Abstract: This work introduces 4 novel probabilistic and reinforcement-driven methods
for association rule mining (ARM): Gaussian process-based association rule
mining (GPAR), Bayesian ARM (BARM), multi-armed bandit based ARM (MAB-ARM), and
reinforcement learning based association rule mining (RLAR). These methods
depart fundamentally from traditional frequency-based algorithms such as
Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat, offering enhanced capabilities for incorporating
prior knowledge, modeling uncertainty, item dependencies, probabilistic
inference and adaptive search strategies. GPAR employs Gaussian processes to
model item co-occurrence via feature representations, enabling principled
inference, uncertainty quantification, and efficient generalization to unseen
itemsets without retraining. BARM adopts a Bayesian framework with priors and
optional correlation structures, yielding robust uncertainty quantification
through full posterior distributions over item presence probabilities. MAB-ARM,
including its Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) companion, utilizes an upper
confidence bound (UCB) strategy for efficient and adaptive exploration of the
itemset space, while RLAR applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn a
generalizable policy for identifying high-quality rules. Collectively, these
approaches improve the flexibility and robustness of ARM, particularly for
discovering rare or complex patterns and operating on small datasets. Empirical
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate their effectiveness,
while also highlighting trade-offs in computational complexity and
interpretability. These innovations mark a significant shift from static,
frequency-driven paradigms, offering some prior and dependency-informed,
uncertainty-aware or scalable ARM frameworks for diverse application domains
such as retail, geography, finance, medical diagnostics, and risk-sensitive
scenarios.

*Hendrik Mehrtens,Tabea Bucher,Titus J. Brinker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal predictions in medical classification face reliability issues under distributional shifts, limited practical value in small-class settings, and pitfalls in subset selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges and limitations of conformal predictions in medical classification tasks, particularly under distributional shifts and small-class settings.

Method: Demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology the unreliability of conformal predictions under input and label distributional shifts.

Result: Conformal predictions are unreliable under shifts, unsuitable for accuracy improvement, and limited in small-class settings.

Conclusion: Practitioners must be cautious with conformal predictions in medicine due to their limitations and assumptions.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges for medical
classification tasks. While many approaches have been proposed, recently the
statistical framework of conformal predictions has gained a lot of attention,
due to its ability to provide provable calibration guarantees. Nonetheless, the
application of conformal predictions in safety-critical areas such as medicine
comes with pitfalls, limitations and assumptions that practitioners need to be
aware of. We demonstrate through examples from dermatology and histopathology
that conformal predictions are unreliable under distributional shifts in input
and label variables. Additionally, conformal predictions should not be used for
selecting predictions to improve accuracy and are not reliable for subsets of
the data, such as individual classes or patient attributes. Moreover, in
classification settings with a small number of classes, which are common in
medical image classification tasks, conformal predictions have limited
practical value.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAAS is a new SOC-based diffusion sampler that avoids importance sampling by using annealed reference dynamics, offering efficient and scalable training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current annealing-based diffusion samplers suffer from high variance and scalability issues due to reliance on importance sampling.

Method: NAAS uses a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint matching to leverage annealed reference dynamics without importance sampling.

Result: NAAS effectively samples from classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

Conclusion: NAAS provides a scalable and efficient alternative to existing diffusion samplers, addressing key limitations of annealing approaches.

Abstract: Recently, there has been significant progress in learning-based diffusion
samplers, which aim to sample from a given unnormalized density. These methods
typically follow one of two paradigms: (i) formulating sampling as an unbiased
stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem using a canonical reference process,
or (ii) refining annealed path measures through importance-weighted sampling.
Although annealing approaches have advantages in guiding samples toward
high-density regions, reliance on importance sampling leads to high variance
and limited scalability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the
\textbf{Non-equilibrium Annealed Adjoint Sampler (NAAS)}, a novel SOC-based
diffusion sampler that leverages annealed reference dynamics without resorting
to importance sampling. NAAS employs a lean adjoint system inspired by adjoint
matching, enabling efficient and scalable training. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach across a range of tasks, including sampling from
classical energy landscapes and molecular Boltzmann distribution.

TL;DR: A steering method for controlling reasoning behaviors in thinking LLMs, validated on DeepSeek-R1-Distill models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of controlling reasoning processes in thinking LLMs, which improve performance but lack controllability.

Method: Analyze and manipulate reasoning behaviors via linear directions in activation space, using steering vectors extracted from 500 tasks across 10 categories.

Result: Demonstrated control over behaviors like uncertainty expression and backtracking, validated on two DeepSeek-R1-Distill models.

Conclusion: Provides interpretable and practical tools for steering reasoning in thinking LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development
of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains
before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance,
controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a
steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific
reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic
experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several
reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing
uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in
reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear
directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering
vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to
modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its
tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical
tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and
interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using two
DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different
model architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Memba introduces a bio-inspired PEFT method for Mamba SSMs, improving efficiency and temporal modeling over traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient fine-tuning of large SSMs like Mamba without ignoring their unique temporal dynamics.

Method: Uses Leaky Integrate Membrane (LIM) neurons for gating, combined with LoRA and cross-layer membrane transfer.

Result: Outperforms existing PEFT methods in language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: Memba is an effective, bio-inspired PEFT approach tailored for Mamba SSMs.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful alternatives to
attention-based Transformers, with Mamba demonstrating impressive efficiency
and scalability. As these models grow increasingly larger, the need for
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods becomes critical to adapt
pre-trained Mamba to downstream tasks without prohibitive computational costs.
However, previous approaches simply apply traditional Transformer-tailored PEFT
methods without addressing the unique temporal processing dynamics of SSMs. To
address this limitation, we propose Memba, a membrane-driven PEFT approach
specifically designed for Mamba. Memba introduces Leaky Integrate Membrane
(LIM) neurons as bio-inspired gating mechanisms that naturally accumulate
membrane potentials over time, enhancing selective information retention. By
strategically combining LIM neurons with Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRA) and
cross-layer membrane transfer, our approach significantly improves Mamba's
temporal modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments across language and
vision tasks demonstrate that Memba achieves substantial improvements over
existing PEFT methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An online learning algorithm for Whittle indices in non-stationary RMABs, using sliding windows and confidence bounds to achieve sub-linear dynamic regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMABs are PSPACE-hard and often have unknown, non-stationary transition kernels, making the Whittle index policy challenging to apply.

Method: Predicts transition kernels via linear optimization with confidence bounds and sliding windows, then computes Whittle indices.

Result: Achieves sub-linear dynamic regret under slow-changing kernels, outperforming baselines in non-stationary settings.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively handles non-stationarity and leverages domain knowledge for efficient learning.

Abstract: We consider optimal resource allocation for restless multi-armed bandits
(RMABs) in unknown, non-stationary settings. RMABs are PSPACE-hard to solve
optimally, even when all parameters are known. The Whittle index policy is
known to achieve asymptotic optimality for a large class of such problems,
while remaining computationally efficient. In many practical settings, however,
the transition kernels required to compute the Whittle index are unknown and
non-stationary. In this work, we propose an online learning algorithm for
Whittle indices in this setting. Our algorithm first predicts current
transition kernels by solving a linear optimization problem based on upper
confidence bounds and empirical transition probabilities calculated from data
over a sliding window. Then, it computes the Whittle index associated with the
predicted transition kernels. We design these sliding windows and upper
confidence bounds to guarantee sub-linear dynamic regret on the number of
episodes $T$, under the condition that transition kernels change slowly over
time (rate upper bounded by $\epsilon=1/T^k$ with $k>0$). Furthermore, our
proposed algorithm and regret analysis are designed to exploit prior domain
knowledge and structural information of the RMABs to accelerate the learning
process. Numerical results validate that our algorithm achieves superior
performance in terms of lowest cumulative regret relative to baselines in
non-stationary environments.

Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets for polymer ML by exploring self-supervised learning.

Method: Using Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) for SSL pretraining on polymer molecular graphs.

Result: JEPA pretraining enhances downstream performance, especially with very scarce labeled data.

Conclusion: JEPA-based SSL is effective for polymer ML when labeled data is limited.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in accelerating
the discovery of polymers with desired properties by aiding in tasks such as
virtual screening via property prediction. However, progress in polymer ML is
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets, which are necessary
for training supervised ML models. In this work, we study the use of the very
recent 'Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture' (JEPA), a type of architecture
for self-supervised learning (SSL), on polymer molecular graphs to understand
whether pretraining with the proposed SSL strategy improves downstream
performance when labeled data is scarce. Our results indicate that JEPA-based
self-supervised pretraining on polymer graphs enhances downstream performance,
particularly when labeled data is very scarce, achieving improvements across
all tested datasets.

*Xingyu Alice Yang,Jianyu Zhang,LÃ©on Bottou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights a limitation in transfer learning called the 'information saturation bottleneck,' where models fail to learn new features after encoding competing ones during pretraining. It suggests task-specific training may outperform large-scale pretraining and proposes richer feature representations as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of ensuring transferred features are sufficient for unseen datasets and quantifying task relatedness in transfer learning.

Method: Evaluates model transfer from a pretraining mixture to component tasks, identifying the 'information saturation bottleneck' and proposing richer feature representations.

Result: Found that models lose critical features during pretraining, leading to inconsistent performance, even on training mixture components.

Conclusion: Suggests task-specific training may be more effective than large-scale pretraining and proposes richer feature representations for better generalization.

Abstract: Transfer learning is a cornerstone of modern machine learning, promising a
way to adapt models pretrained on a broad mix of data to new tasks with minimal
new data. However, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that transferred
features are sufficient to handle unseen datasets, amplified by the difficulty
of quantifying whether two tasks are "related". To address these challenges, we
evaluate model transfer from a pretraining mixture to each of its component
tasks, assessing whether pretrained features can match the performance of
task-specific direct training. We identify a fundamental limitation in deep
learning models -- an "information saturation bottleneck" -- where networks
fail to learn new features once they encode similar competing features during
training. When restricted to learning only a subset of key features during
pretraining, models will permanently lose critical features for transfer and
perform inconsistently on data distributions, even components of the training
mixture. Empirical evidence from published studies suggests that this
phenomenon is pervasive in deep learning architectures -- factors such as data
distribution or ordering affect the features that current representation
learning methods can learn over time. This study suggests that relying solely
on large-scale networks may not be as effective as focusing on task-specific
training, when available. We propose richer feature representations as a
potential solution to better generalize across new datasets and, specifically,
present existing methods alongside a novel approach, the initial steps towards
addressing this challenge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdapThink is an adaptive post-training framework for language models, improving reasoning efficiency without sacrificing performance by dynamically adjusting reflection preferences and balancing accuracy with diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based post-training methods for language models lack adaptability, leading to inefficiencies in handling questions of varying complexity.

Method: AdapThink introduces a group-relative reward function and a diversity-aware sampling mechanism to dynamically adjust reasoning processes.

Result: Experiments show AdapThink enhances adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigates inefficiencies in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: AdapThink effectively balances reasoning efficiency and performance, addressing the limitations of static approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based post-training has significantly advanced
the complex reasoning capabilities of language models, fostering sophisticated
self-reflection processes. However, this ``slow thinking'' paradigm presents a
critical challenge to reasoning efficiency: models may expend excessive
computation on simple questions and shift reasoning prematurely for complex
ones. Previous mechanisms typically rely on static length budgets or predefined
rules, lacking the adaptability for varying question complexities and models'
evolving capabilities. To this end, we propose AdapThink, an adaptive
post-training framework designed to induce more efficient thinking while
maintaining the performance of reasoning language models. Specifically,
AdapThink incorporates two key mechanisms: 1) A group-relative reward function
that leverages model confidence and response's characteristic to dynamically
adjust the preference of reflection-related transition words without resorting
to a fixed length preference. 2) A diversity-aware sampling mechanism that
balances the training group's solution accuracy with reasoning diversity via an
entropy-guided score. Experiments on several mathematical reasoning datasets
with DeepSeek-distilled models demonstrate AdapThink's advantages in enabling
adaptive reasoning patterns and mitigating the inefficiencies.

Conclusion: The proposed QBO model and QCGD algorithm successfully address challenges in quantized neural network training, showing promise for quantum computing applications in AI.

Abstract: Here in this work, we present a novel Quadratic Binary Optimization (QBO)
model for quantized neural network training, enabling the use of arbitrary
activation and loss functions through spline interpolation. We introduce
Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges
of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by
discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach
preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while
allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers,
thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide
theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising
spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk
minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge
in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO)
model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing
the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of
penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem,
increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality.
To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD)
algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO
problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with
randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited
precision constraints in the coefficient matrix. Additionally, we provide an
upper bound on the Time-To-Solution for the QCBO solving process. Experimental
results using a coherent Ising machine (CIM) demonstrate a 94.95% accuracy on
the Fashion MNIST classification task, with only 1.1-bit precision.

*Tong Li,Long Liu,Yihang Hu,Hu Chen,Shifeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFPT-KD and DFPT-KD+ address the capacity gap in knowledge distillation by using prompt-based learning and dual-forward paths, improving student performance beyond vanilla KD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The large capacity gap between teacher and student networks in knowledge distillation limits performance gains, and existing methods fail to dynamically adjust knowledge transfer.

Method: DFPT-KD introduces a dual-forward path teacher with prompt-based tuning, while DFPT-KD+ fine-tunes the entire prompt-based path for better compatibility.

Result: DFPT-KD outperforms vanilla KD, and DFPT-KD+ further enhances accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Prompt-based tuning and dual-forward paths effectively address the capacity gap, enabling students to achieve higher performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) provides an effective way to improve the
performance of a student network under the guidance of pre-trained teachers.
However, this approach usually brings in a large capacity gap between teacher
and student networks, limiting the distillation gains. Previous methods
addressing this problem either discard accurate knowledge representation or
fail to dynamically adjust the transferred knowledge, which is less effective
in addressing the capacity gap problem and hinders students from achieving
comparable performance with the pre-trained teacher. In this work, we extend
the ideology of prompt-based learning to address the capacity gap problem, and
propose Dual-Forward Path Teacher Knowledge Distillation (DFPT-KD), which
replaces the pre-trained teacher with a novel dual-forward path teacher to
supervise the learning of student. The key to DFPT-KD is prompt-based tuning,
i.e., establishing an additional prompt-based forward path within the
pre-trained teacher and optimizing it with the pre-trained teacher frozen to
make the transferred knowledge compatible with the representation ability of
the student. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFPT-KD leads to trained
students performing better than the vanilla KD. To make the transferred
knowledge better compatible with the representation abilities of the student,
we further fine-tune the whole prompt-based forward path, yielding a novel
distillation approach dubbed DFPT-KD+. By extensive experiments, it is shown
that DFPT-KD+ improves upon DFPT-KD and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
performance.

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) to enhance uncertainty propagation, using a two-stage training process and testing on analytical and flight data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unexplored potential of PIML in predicting and propagating modeling uncertainties, crucial for reliability analysis and robust optimization.

Method: Hybrid PIML architectures with BNNs are developed, using a two-stage training process to overcome challenges in probabilistic ML models.

Result: BNN-integrated PIML performs slightly worse or comparably to purely data-driven ML and original PIML models, with Monte Carlo sampling of BNN weights being effective for uncertainty propagation.

Conclusion: BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation in PIML architectures, supported by their auto-differentiability and effective Monte Carlo sampling.

Abstract: Quantifying and propagating modeling uncertainties is crucial for reliability
analysis, robust optimization, and other model-based algorithmic processes in
engineering design and control. Now, physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
methods have emerged in recent years as a new alternative to traditional
computational modeling and surrogate modeling methods, offering a balance
between computing efficiency, modeling accuracy, and interpretability. However,
their ability to predict and propagate modeling uncertainties remains mostly
unexplored. In this paper, a promising class of auto-differentiable hybrid PIML
architectures that combine partial physics and neural networks or ANNs (for
input transformation or adaptive parameter estimation) is integrated with
Bayesian Neural networks (replacing the ANNs); this is done with the goal to
explore whether BNNs can successfully provision uncertainty propagation
capabilities in the PIML architectures as well, further supported by the
auto-differentiability of these architectures. A two-stage training process is
used to alleviate the challenges traditionally encountered in training
probabilistic ML models. The resulting BNN-integrated PIML architecture is
evaluated on an analytical benchmark problem and flight experiments data for a
fixed-wing RC aircraft, with prediction performance observed to be slightly
worse or at par with purely data-driven ML and original PIML models. Moreover,
Monte Carlo sampling of probabilistic BNN weights was found to be most
effective in propagating uncertainty in the BNN-integrated PIML architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLPR is a verifier-free framework that uses LLM's token probability scores as rewards, improving reasoning in general and mathematical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods are limited to specific domains due to reliance on verifiers, prompting the need for a scalable, general-domain solution.

Method: RLPR leverages LLM's intrinsic token probabilities for correct answers as rewards, with techniques to stabilize and reduce variance.

Result: RLPR outperforms VeriFree and verifier-dependent methods, showing consistent improvements across benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLPR successfully extends RLVR to general domains without verifiers, enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates promising
potential in advancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, its success
remains largely confined to mathematical and code domains. This primary
limitation stems from the heavy reliance on domain-specific verifiers, which
results in prohibitive complexity and limited scalability. To address the
challenge, our key observation is that LLM's intrinsic probability of
generating a correct free-form answer directly indicates its own evaluation of
the reasoning reward (i.e., how well the reasoning process leads to the correct
answer). Building on this insight, we propose RLPR, a simple verifier-free
framework that extrapolates RLVR to broader general domains. RLPR uses the
LLM's own token probability scores for reference answers as the reward signal
and maximizes the expected reward during training. We find that addressing the
high variance of this noisy probability reward is crucial to make it work, and
propose prob-to-reward and stabilizing methods to ensure a precise and stable
reward from LLM intrinsic probabilities. Comprehensive experiments in four
general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks show that RLPR
consistently improves reasoning capabilities in both areas for Gemma, Llama,
and Qwen based models. Notably, RLPR outperforms concurrent VeriFree by 7.6
points on TheoremQA and 7.5 points on Minerva, and even surpasses strong
verifier-model-dependent approaches General-Reasoner by 1.6 average points
across seven benchmarks.

*Li Tang,Peter A. Torrione,Cihat Eldeniz,Leslie M. Collins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes Kalman and particle filter frameworks to mitigate ground bounce interference in GPR data for better landmine detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground bounce in GPR data interferes with landmine detection, especially for low-metal mines.

Method: Uses Kalman and particle filters to model ground bounce as a hidden state, updating parameters adaptively with new data.

Result: Experiments show improved ground bounce tracking enhances landmine detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed filters effectively reduce ground bounce interference, improving detection accuracy.

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) provides a promising technology for accurate
subsurface object detection. In particular, it has shown promise for detecting
landmines with low metal content. However, the ground bounce (GB) that is
present in GPR data, which is caused by the dielectric discontinuity between
soil and air, is a major source of interference and degrades landmine detection
performance. To mitigate this interference, GB tracking algorithms formulated
using both a Kalman filter (KF) and a particle filter (PF) framework are
proposed. In particular, the location of the GB in the radar signal is modeled
as the hidden state in a stochastic system for the PF approach. The
observations are the 2D radar images, which arrive scan by scan along the
down-track direction. An initial training stage sets parameters automatically
to accommodate different ground and weather conditions. The features associated
with the GB description are updated adaptively with the arrival of new data.
The prior distribution for a given location is predicted by propagating
information from two adjacent channels/scans, which ensures that the overall GB
surface remains smooth. The proposed algorithms are verified in experiments
utilizing real data, and their performances are compared with other GB tracking
approaches. We demonstrate that improved GB tracking contributes to improved
performance for the landmine detection problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the limitation of fixed-rank LoRA methods by adapting ranks dynamically per transformer layer and attention head for heterogeneous learning dynamics.

Method: Uses learnable scaling factors optimized via a meta-objective with â1 sparsity and Total Variation regularization for stable rank transitions.

Result: Achieves 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with 0.32% trainable parameters and reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%.

Conclusion: Dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation is critical for efficient foundation model adaptation.

Abstract: Conventional Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods employ a fixed rank, imposing
uniform adaptation across transformer layers and attention heads despite their
heterogeneous learning dynamics. This paper introduces Adaptive Rank Dynamic
LoRA (ARD-LoRA), a novel framework that automates rank allocation through
learnable scaling factors. These factors are optimized via a meta-objective
balancing task performance and parameter efficiency, incorporating $\ell_1$
sparsity for minimal rank and Total Variation regularization for stable rank
transitions. ARD-LoRA enables continuous, differentiable, per-head rank
adaptation. Experiments on LLAMA-3.1-70B and PaliGemma-2 demonstrate ARD-LoRA's
efficacy, achieving up to 99.3% of full fine-tuning performance with only 0.32%
trainable parameters, outperforming strong baselines like DoRA and AdaLoRA.
Furthermore, it reduces multimodal adaptation memory by 41%. These results
establish dynamic, fine-grained rank allocation as a critical paradigm for
efficient foundation model adaptation.

Additionally, audio transcripts are extracted for further verification.
Noticeably, the entire pipeline is automated using GPT-4o through prompt

TL;DR: ADAG is a novel attention-based model for learning multiple DAGs efficiently, addressing computational and identifiability challenges in small-sample regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAG learning faces computational and identifiability challenges, especially in small-sample settings, prompting the need for a scalable and generalizable solution.

Method: Proposes ADAG, an attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple linear SEMs, leveraging multi-task learning and continuous optimization.

Result: ADAG improves DAG learning accuracy and zero-shot inference efficiency on synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: ADAG is the first practical foundation model for DAG learning, enhancing efficiency and generalizability in causal discovery.

Abstract: Due to its human-interpretability and invariance properties, Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) has been a foundational tool across various areas of AI research,
leading to significant advancements. However, DAG learning remains highly
challenging, due to its super-exponential growth in computational cost and
identifiability issues, particularly in small-sample regimes. To address these
two challenges, in this work we leverage the recent success of linear
transformers and develop a foundation model approach for discovering multiple
order-consistent DAGs across tasks. In particular, we propose Attention-DAG
(ADAG), a novel attention-mechanism-based architecture for learning multiple
linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs). ADAG learns the mapping from observed
data to both graph structure and parameters via a nonlinear attention-based
kernel, enabling efficient multi-task estimation of the underlying linear SEMs.
By formulating the learning process across multiple tasks as a continuous
optimization problem, the pre-trained ADAG model captures the common structural
properties as a shared low-dimensional prior, thereby reducing the
ill-posedness of downstream DAG learning tasks in small-sample regimes. We
evaluate our proposed approach on benchmark synthetic datasets and find that
ADAG achieves substantial improvements in both DAG learning accuracy and
zero-shot inference efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
practical approach for pre-training a foundation model specifically designed
for DAG learning, representing a step toward more efficient and generalizable
down-stream applications in causal discovery.

TL;DR: The paper identifies instability in the PF-ODE generation process as a cause of reconstruction errors in diffusion models, proving its inevitability in high-dimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain and address the noticeable reconstruction errors in diffusion models, which cannot be attributed to numerical errors alone.

Method: Identifies instability in PF-ODE generation, conducts experiments on toy examples and open-source diffusion models, and provides theoretical proof of instability's inevitability in high-dimensional data.

Result: Demonstrates that instability amplifies reconstruction errors and proves its probability converges to one as data dimensionality increases.

Conclusion: Highlights inherent challenges in diffusion-based reconstruction and suggests insights for future improvements.

Abstract: Diffusion reconstruction plays a critical role in various applications such
as image editing, restoration, and style transfer. In theory, the
reconstruction should be simple - it just inverts and regenerates images by
numerically solving the Probability Flow-Ordinary Differential Equation
(PF-ODE). Yet in practice, noticeable reconstruction errors have been observed,
which cannot be well explained by numerical errors. In this work, we identify a
deeper intrinsic property in the PF-ODE generation process, the instability,
that can further amplify the reconstruction errors. The root of this
instability lies in the sparsity inherent in the generation distribution, which
means that the probability is concentrated on scattered and small regions while
the vast majority remains almost empty. To demonstrate the existence of
instability and its amplification on reconstruction error, we conduct
experiments on both toy numerical examples and popular open-sourced diffusion
models. Furthermore, based on the characteristics of image data, we
theoretically prove that the instability's probability converges to one as the
data dimensionality increases. Our findings highlight the inherent challenges
in diffusion-based reconstruction and can offer insights for future
improvements.

Result: GeNeRT outperforms baselines in accuracy and runtime efficiency, generalizing well to untrained regions and unseen environments.

Conclusion: GeNeRT effectively captures ray-surface interactions, offering superior performance in neural RT for channel modeling.

Abstract: Neural ray tracing (RT) has emerged as a promising paradigm for channel
modeling by combining physical propagation principles with neural networks. It
enables high modeling accuracy and efficiency. However, current neural RT
methods face two key limitations: constrained generalization capability due to
strong spatial dependence, and weak adherence to electromagnetic laws. In this
paper, we propose GeNeRT, a Generalizable Neural RT framework with enhanced
generalization, accuracy and efficiency. GeNeRT supports both intra-scenario
spatial transferability and inter-scenario zero-shot generalization. By
incorporating Fresnel-inspired neural network design, it also achieves higher
accuracy in multipath component (MPC) prediction. Furthermore, a GPU-tensorized
acceleration strategy is introduced to improve runtime efficiency. Extensive
experiments conducted in outdoor scenarios demonstrate that GeNeRT generalizes
well across untrained regions within a scenario and entirely unseen
environments, and achieves superior accuracy in MPC prediction compared to
baselines. Moreover, it outperforms Wireless Insite in runtime efficiency,
particularly in multi-transmitter settings. Ablation experiments validate the
effectiveness of the network architecture and training strategy in capturing
physical principles of ray-surface interactions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method for DRL-based autonomous driving policies to improve attack efficiency and training stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL-based policies for autonomous driving are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which poses safety risks. Existing attack methods are inefficient or unstable.

Method: The method uses an expert policy derived from attack demonstrations via imitation learning, guided by a KL-divergence regularization term, and includes a performance-aware annealing strategy.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, even with sub-optimal expert policies.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses inefficiency and instability in adversarial attacks on DRL-based autonomous driving policies.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
autonomous driving. However, despite their advanced capabilities, DRL-based
policies remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing serious safety
risks in real-world deployments. Investigating such attacks is crucial for
revealing policy vulnerabilities and guiding the development of more robust
autonomous systems. While prior attack methods have made notable progress, they
still face several challenges: 1) they often rely on high-frequency attacks,
yet critical attack opportunities are typically context-dependent and
temporally sparse, resulting in inefficient attack patterns; 2) restricting
attack frequency can improve efficiency but often results in unstable training
due to the adversary's limited exploration. To address these challenges, we
propose an adaptive expert-guided adversarial attack method that enhances both
the stability and efficiency of attack policy training. Our method first
derives an expert policy from successful attack demonstrations using imitation
learning, strengthened by an ensemble Mixture-of-Experts architecture for
robust generalization across scenarios. This expert policy then guides a
DRL-based adversary through a KL-divergence regularization term. Due to the
diversity of scenarios, expert policies may be imperfect. To address this, we
further introduce a performance-aware annealing strategy that gradually reduces
reliance on the expert as the adversary improves. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves outperforms existing approaches in terms
of collision rate, attack efficiency, and training stability, especially in
cases where the expert policy is sub-optimal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large MoE models are memory-intensive and expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Multi-stage compression framework slims experts and transfers knowledge through intermediate stages, avoiding performance degradation.

Result: Compressed models (Phi-mini-MoE and Phi-tiny-MoE) outperform similar-sized models and remain competitive with larger ones.

Conclusion: Structured pruning with staged distillation creates high-quality, compact MoE models, enabling broader adoption.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for scaling large language models (LLMs) while maintaining inference
efficiency. However, their enormous memory requirements make them prohibitively
expensive to fine-tune or deploy in resource-constrained environments. To
address this challenge, we introduce SlimMoE, a multi-stage compression
framework for transforming large MoE models into much smaller, efficient
variants without incurring the prohibitive costs of training from scratch. Our
method systematically reduces parameter counts by slimming experts and
transferring knowledge through intermediate stages, effectively mitigating the
performance degradation common in one-shot pruning approaches. Using this
framework, we compress Phi 3.5-MoE (41.9B total/6.6B activated parameters) to
create Phi-mini-MoE (7.6B total/2.4B activated parameters) and Phi-tiny-MoE
(3.8B total/1.1B activated parameters) using only 400B tokens--less than 10% of
the original model's training data. These compressed models can be fine-tuned
on a single GPU (A100 for Phi-mini-MoE, A6000 for Phi-tiny-MoE), making them
highly suitable for academic and resource-limited settings. Our experiments
demonstrate that these compressed models outperform others of similar size and
remain competitive with larger models. For instance, Phi-mini-MoE achieves
similar or better performance to Phi-3-mini using only 2/3 of the activated
parameters and yields comparable MMLU scores to Llama 3.1 8B despite having
significantly lower latency. Our findings demonstrate that structured pruning
combined with staged distillation offers an effective path to creating
high-quality, compact MoE models, paving the way for broader adoption of MoE
architectures. We make our models publicly available at

remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured
Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates
structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).
SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function
approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual
sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable
quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent
representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of
KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing
dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the
Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to
refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered
equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE
achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent
models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.

### [424] [Controlled Generation with Equivariant Variational Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18340)
*Floor Eijkelboom,Heiko Zimmermann,Sharvaree Vadgama,Erik J Bekkers,Max Welling,Christian A. Naesseth,Jan-Willem van de Meent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for controlled generation using Variational Flow Matching (VFM) is introduced, enabling both end-to-end training and post hoc Bayesian control, with applications in equivariant molecular generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference for scalable, constraint-driven, and symmetry-aware generation.

Method: Derives a controlled generation objective within VFM, implements it via end-to-end training or Bayesian inference, and formulates an equivariant VFM for molecular generation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, outperforming existing models.

Conclusion: Strengthens the link between flow-based models and Bayesian inference, providing a principled framework for controlled and symmetry-aware generation.

Abstract: We derive a controlled generation objective within the framework of
Variational Flow Matching (VFM), which casts flow matching as a variational
inference problem. We demonstrate that controlled generation can be implemented
two ways: (1) by way of end-to-end training of conditional generative models,
or (2) as a Bayesian inference problem, enabling post hoc control of
unconditional models without retraining. Furthermore, we establish the
conditions required for equivariant generation and provide an equivariant
formulation of VFM tailored for molecular generation, ensuring invariance to
rotations, translations, and permutations. We evaluate our approach on both
uncontrolled and controlled molecular generation, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on uncontrolled generation and outperforming state-of-the-art
models in controlled generation, both with end-to-end training and in the
Bayesian inference setting. This work strengthens the connection between
flow-based generative modeling and Bayesian inference, offering a scalable and
principled framework for constraint-driven and symmetry-aware generation.

*Aviral Gupta,Armaan Sethi,Ameesh Sethi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free method using bias vectors to mitigate classification bias in neural networks by adjusting activations at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing biases in classifiers due to uneven group representation without costly retraining or compute.

Method: Compute bias vectors from mean activation differences between groups and subtract them from the model's residual stream.

Result: Reduced classification bias and improved worst-group accuracy in transformer-like classifiers.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a cheap, inference-time solution for bias mitigation in classification models.

Abstract: Neural network classifiers trained on datasets with uneven group
representation often inherit class biases and learn spurious correlations.
These models may perform well on average but consistently fail on atypical
groups. For example, in hair color classification, datasets may over-represent
females with blond hair, reinforcing stereotypes. Although various algorithmic
and data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often
require retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,
training-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in
large language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between
majority and minority groups to define a "bias vector," which we subtract from
the model's residual stream. This leads to reduced classification bias and
improved worst-group accuracy. We explore multiple strategies for extracting
and applying these vectors in transformer-like classifiers, showing that
steering vectors, traditionally used in generative models, can also be
effective in classification. More broadly, we showcase an extremely cheap,
inference time, training free method to mitigate bias in classification models.

*Koushik Viswanadha,Deepanway Ghosal,Somak Aditya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes finetuning LLMs with a new dataset (LogicPO) and preference optimization techniques (DPO, KTO) to improve logical reasoning by better converting natural language problems to logical formulations, outperforming GPT-3.5-turbo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to accurately convert natural language reasoning problems to logical formulations, limiting LLMs' reasoning ability.

Method: Introduces LogicPO dataset and uses DPO/KTO to finetune LLMs (e.g., Phi-3.5) for better logical representation.

Result: Phi-3.5 outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo (8-shot) with 10% more logically correct outputs and 14% fewer syntax errors.

Conclusion: The framework and metrics offer a promising direction for enhancing LLMs' logical reasoning through improved logical formulation.

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a key task for artificial intelligence due to it's role
in major downstream tasks such as Question Answering, Summarization. Recent
methods in improving the reasoning ability of LLMs fall short in correctly
converting a natural language reasoning problem to an equivalent logical
formulation, which hinders the framework's overall ability to reason. Towards
this, we propose to use finetuning on a preference optimization dataset to
learn to parse and represent a natural language problem as a whole to a
consistent logical program by 1) introducing a new supervised and preference
optimization dataset LogicPO, and 2) adopting popular techniques such as Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), Kahneman-Tversky optimization (KTO) to finetune
open-source LLMs. Our best model with Phi-3.5 consistently outperforms
GPT-3.5-turbo's (8-shot) by producing 10% more logically correct and with 14%
less syntax errors. Through the framework and our improved evaluation metrics,
we offer a promising direction in improving the logical reasoning of LLMs by
better representing them in their logical formulations.

*Marco Aruta,Ciro Listone,Giuseppe Murano,Aniello Murano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADNF introduces a streaming-capable neuro-fuzzy clustering framework for leukemia diagnosis, combining CNN-based feature extraction with dynamic fuzzy clustering, outperforming static methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional clustering methods lack flexibility for evolving cellular patterns and real-time uncertainty quantification in leukemia diagnosis.

Method: ADNF uses CNN-based feature extraction and online fuzzy clustering, updating parameters via Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) and refining topology with density-weighted merging and entropy-guided splitting.

Result: Achieves a silhouette score of 0.51 on the C-NMC leukemia dataset, showing better cohesion and separation than static methods.

Conclusion: ADNF's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation offer scalable, real-time support for personalized leukemia management, suitable for integration in pediatric oncology networks.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis and monitoring rely increasingly on high-throughput image
data, yet conventional clustering methods lack the flexibility to accommodate
evolving cellular patterns and quantify uncertainty in real time. We introduce
Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable
framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction
with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via
Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and
fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy
evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and
entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the
C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of
0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The
method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate
potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network,
enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.

*Chenxing Wei,Jiarui Yu,Ying Tiffany He,Hande Dong,Yao Shu,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReDit (Reward Dithering) improves LLM reasoning by adding random noise to discrete rewards, enabling smoother gradients, faster convergence, and better exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete rewards in rule-based systems cause gradient anomalies, unstable optimization, and slow convergence.

Method: ReDit dithers discrete rewards with random noise, providing exploratory gradients and stochasticity in flat reward regions.

Result: ReDit matches vanilla GRPO performance in 10% of the training steps and shows a 4% improvement with similar training duration. Gradient issues are mitigated.

Conclusion: ReDit is an effective and efficient method for enhancing LLM reasoning, validated by experiments and theory.

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has successfully enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning
capabilities through its rule-based reward system. While it's a ''perfect''
reward system that effectively mitigates reward hacking, such reward functions
are often discrete. Our experimental observations suggest that discrete rewards
can lead to gradient anomaly, unstable optimization, and slow convergence. To
address this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers
the discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed
reward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning
process, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The
injected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,
encouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO
with only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits
a 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar
duration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with
ReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these
advantages.

*Dominique Mercier,Andreas Dengel,Sheraz,Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreqATT is a framework for interpreting time-series-based deep neural networks by analyzing frequencies, outperforming existing methods in highlighting relevant input areas and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks lack interpretability, especially for time-series data, limiting their usability. Existing methods are insufficient for time-series analysis.

Method: FreqATT evaluates relevant frequencies in the input signal, either filtering or marking the significant data.

Result: The frequency-domain analysis highlights input areas better and is more robust to signal fluctuations than existing methods.

Conclusion: FreqATT provides a robust and effective post-hoc interpretability solution for time-series-based neural networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are among the most successful algorithms in terms of
performance and scalability in different domains. However, since these networks
are black boxes, their usability is severely restricted due to the lack of
interpretability. Existing interpretability methods do not address the analysis
of time-series-based networks specifically enough. This paper shows that an
analysis in the frequency domain can not only highlight relevant areas in the
input signal better than existing methods, but is also more robust to
fluctuations in the signal. In this paper, FreqATT is presented, a framework
that enables post-hoc networks to interpret time series analysis. To achieve
this, the relevant different frequencies are evaluated and the signal is either
filtered or the relevant input data is marked.

*Jie Li,Shifei Ding,Lili Guo,Xuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAGTKD, a model for Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC), using prompt learning and knowledge distillation to enhance modality representations and a transformer for integration, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating efficient modality-specific representations in ERC and overcoming the neglect of varying modality contributions and high complexity in previous methods.

Method: Proposes MAGTKD, combining prompt learning for textual modality, knowledge distillation for weaker modalities, and a multi-modal anchor gated transformer for integration.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MAGTKD successfully enhances modality representations and improves emotion recognition in conversations.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) aims to detect the emotions of
individual utterances within a conversation. Generating efficient and
modality-specific representations for each utterance remains a significant
challenge. Previous studies have proposed various models to integrate features
extracted using different modality-specific encoders. However, they neglect the
varying contributions of modalities to this task and introduce high complexity
by aligning modalities at the frame level. To address these challenges, we
propose the Multi-modal Anchor Gated Transformer with Knowledge Distillation
(MAGTKD) for the ERC task. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to enhance
textual modality representations, while knowledge distillation is utilized to
strengthen representations of weaker modalities. Furthermore, we introduce a
multi-modal anchor gated transformer to effectively integrate utterance-level
representations across modalities. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and
MELD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of knowledge distillation in
enhancing modality representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
emotion recognition. Our code is available at:

*Leonard S. Pleiss,Tobias Sutter,Maximilian Schiffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ReaPER, an extension of Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), using a novel measure of temporal difference error reliability to improve sampling efficiency in reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional uniform sampling in experience replay ignores differences in learning potential. PER improved efficiency but lacked reliability in error estimation.

Method: The authors propose ReaPER, which adjusts PER by incorporating a reliability measure for temporal difference errors, theoretically enhancing learning efficiency.

Result: ReaPER outperforms PER in various environments, including the Atari-5 benchmark, demonstrating more efficient learning.

Conclusion: ReaPER advances experience replay by reliably prioritizing transitions, offering a more efficient alternative to PER.

Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-5 benchmark.

*Csaba Zsolnai,Niels LÃ¶rch,Julian Arnold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural network-based method for detecting shifts in public discourse using news data, leveraging learning-by-confusion to identify changepoints like major historical events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding societal dynamics by detecting shifts in public discourse, especially given the challenges of high-dimensional, sparse, and noisy real-world data.

Method: Uses learning-by-confusion to train classifiers distinguishing articles from different time periods, measuring classification accuracy to estimate distribution distances and identify changepoints.

Result: Successfully detected major events (e.g., 9/11, COVID-19, elections) in synthetic and real-world data (The Guardian), providing quantitative change measures.

Conclusion: The method autonomously identifies discourse shifts with minimal domain knowledge, offering value for journalism, policy, and crisis monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting when public discourse shifts in response to major events is crucial
for understanding societal dynamics. Real-world data is high-dimensional,
sparse, and noisy, making changepoint detection in this domain a challenging
endeavor. In this paper, we leverage neural networks for changepoint detection
in news data, introducing a method based on the so-called learning-by-confusion
scheme, which was originally developed for detecting phase transitions in
physical systems. We train classifiers to distinguish between articles from
different time periods. The resulting classification accuracy is used to
estimate the total variation distance between underlying content distributions,
where significant distances highlight changepoints. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this method on both synthetic datasets and real-world data
from The Guardian newspaper, successfully identifying major historical events
including 9/11, the COVID-19 pandemic, and presidential elections. Our approach
requires minimal domain knowledge, can autonomously discover significant shifts
in public discourse, and yields a quantitative measure of change in content,
making it valuable for journalism, policy analysis, and crisis monitoring.

*Aniss Bessalah,Hatem Mohamed Abdelmoumen,Karima Benatchba,Hadjer Benmeziane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnalogNAS-Bench is the first NAS benchmark for AIMC, revealing insights about robust architectures and limitations of current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art neural networks aren't designed for AIMC's non-idealities, necessitating a dedicated NAS benchmark.

Method: Introduces AnalogNAS-Bench to compare NAS methodologies and extract insights for AIMC-specific constraints.

Result: Key findings: standard quantization misses AIMC noises, robust architectures are wider/branched, skip connections aid noise resilience.

Conclusion: AnalogNAS-Bench addresses current NAS benchmark gaps and enables future analog-aware NAS.

Abstract: Analog In-memory Computing (AIMC) has emerged as a highly efficient paradigm
for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), offering significant energy and
latency benefits over conventional digital hardware. However, state-of-the-art
neural networks are not inherently designed for AIMC, as they fail to account
for its unique non-idealities. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is thus needed
to systematically discover neural architectures optimized explicitly for AIMC
constraints. However, comparing NAS methodologies and extracting insights about
robust architectures for AIMC requires a dedicated NAS benchmark that
explicitly accounts for AIMC-specific hardware non-idealities. To address this,
we introduce AnalogNAS-Bench, the first NAS benchmark tailored specifically for
AIMC. Our study reveals three key insights: (1) standard quantization
techniques fail to capture AIMC-specific noises, (2) robust architectures tend
to feature wider and branched blocks, (3) skip connections improve resilience
to temporal drift noise. These insights highlight the limitations of current
NAS benchmarks for AIMC and pave the way for future analog-aware NAS. All the
implementations used in this paper can be found at

### [434] [PuckTrick: A Library for Making Synthetic Data More Realistic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18499)
*Alessandra Agostini,Andrea Maurino,Blerina Spahiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pucktrick is a Python library for contaminating synthetic datasets with controlled errors to improve ML model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data imperfections are often missing in synthetic datasets, limiting model generalization and robustness.

Method: Pucktrick introduces controlled errors (e.g., missing values, noise, outliers) into synthetic datasets and evaluates ML model performance.

Result: Models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained on error-free synthetic data, especially for tree-based and linear models.

Conclusion: Systematic contamination of synthetic data enhances model resilience and better reflects real-world conditions.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models for decision-making
requires high-quality training data. However, access to real-world datasets is
often restricted due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, and
incomplete data availability. As a result, synthetic data generation (SDG) has
emerged as a viable alternative, enabling the creation of artificial datasets
that preserve the statistical properties of real data while ensuring privacy
compliance. Despite its advantages, synthetic data is often overly clean and
lacks real-world imperfections, such as missing values, noise, outliers, and
misclassified labels, which can significantly impact model generalization and
robustness. To address this limitation, we introduce Pucktrick, a Python
library designed to systematically contaminate synthetic datasets by
introducing controlled errors. The library supports multiple error types,
including missing data, noisy values, outliers, label misclassification,
duplication, and class imbalance, offering a structured approach to evaluating
ML model resilience under real-world data imperfections. Pucktrick provides two
contamination modes: one for injecting errors into clean datasets and another
for further corrupting already contaminated datasets. Through extensive
experiments on real-world financial datasets, we evaluate the impact of
systematic data contamination on model performance. Our findings demonstrate
that ML models trained on contaminated synthetic data outperform those trained
on purely synthetic, error-free data, particularly for tree-based and linear
models such as SVMs and Extra Trees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDOT, a transformer-based model for reconstructing multidimensional ODEs, and the DIV-diff metric for stable evaluation. DDOT outperforms existing methods, showing practical impact on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional symbolic regression struggles with temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations in ODEs. ODEFormer's single-trajectory focus is sensitive to initial points, limiting performance assessment.

Method: Proposes DIV-diff for stable evaluation over a grid of points and DDOT, a transformer model with an auxiliary task predicting ODE derivatives.

Result: DDOT outperforms existing methods, improving reconstruction and generalization by 4.58% and 1.62%, respectively, and reducing DIV-diff by 3.55%.

Conclusion: DDOT and DIV-diff provide a robust solution for ODE inference, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Uncovering the underlying ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that govern
dynamic systems is crucial for advancing our understanding of complex
phenomena. Traditional symbolic regression methods often struggle to capture
the temporal dynamics and intervariable correlations inherent in ODEs.
ODEFormer, a state-of-the-art method for inferring multidimensional ODEs from
single trajectories, has made notable progress. However, its focus on
single-trajectory evaluation is highly sensitive to initial starting points,
which may not fully reflect true performance. To address this, we propose the
divergence difference metric (DIV-diff), which evaluates divergence over a grid
of points within the target region, offering a comprehensive and stable
analysis of the variable space. Alongside, we introduce DDOT
(Derivative-Directed Dual-Decoder Ordinary Differential Equation Transformer),
a transformer-based model designed to reconstruct multidimensional ODEs in
symbolic form. By incorporating an auxiliary task predicting the ODE's
derivative, DDOT effectively captures both structure and dynamic behavior.
Experiments on ODEBench show DDOT outperforms existing symbolic regression
methods, achieving an absolute improvement of 4.58% and 1.62% in $P(R^2 > 0.9)$
for reconstruction and generalization tasks, respectively, and an absolute
reduction of 3.55% in DIV-diff. Furthermore, DDOT demonstrates real-world
applicability on an anesthesia dataset, highlighting its practical impact.

TL;DR: Federated learning enables collaborative ML model training in chemical engineering without sharing proprietary data, improving accuracy while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary data silos in the chemical industry hinder ML model training; federated learning offers a solution by allowing collaborative training without data disclosure.

Method: Applied federated learning in two case studies: (i) binary mixture activity coefficient prediction with graph neural networks, and (ii) distillation column system identification with autoencoders.

Result: Federated learning models achieved higher accuracy than individually trained models and performed similarly to models trained on combined datasets.

Conclusion: Federated learning holds great potential for advancing ML in chemical engineering while maintaining data privacy, making it promising for industrial use.

Abstract: We present a perspective on federated learning in chemical engineering that
envisions collaborative efforts in machine learning (ML) developments within
the chemical industry. Large amounts of chemical and process data are
proprietary to chemical companies and are therefore locked in data silos,
hindering the training of ML models on large data sets in chemical engineering.
Recently, the concept of federated learning has gained increasing attention in
ML research, enabling organizations to jointly train machine learning models
without disclosure of their individual data. We discuss potential applications
of federated learning in several fields of chemical engineering, from the
molecular to the process scale. In addition, we apply federated learning in two
exemplary case studies that simulate practical scenarios of multiple chemical
companies holding proprietary data sets: (i) prediction of binary mixture
activity coefficients with graph neural networks and (ii) system identification
of a distillation column with autoencoders. Our results indicate that ML models
jointly trained with federated learning yield significantly higher accuracy
than models trained by each chemical company individually and can perform
similarly to models trained on combined datasets from all companies. Federated
learning has therefore great potential to advance ML models in chemical
engineering while respecting corporate data privacy, making it promising for
future industrial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in multi-agent reinforcement learning, such as partial observability and non-stationarity, by modeling agent behavior and adapting to evolving policies.

Method: Uses a decentralized imagination framework, semi-centralized critic, teammate prediction, and prioritized replay for training. Evaluated on StarCraft, PettingZoo, and MeltingPot benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong sample efficiency (near-optimal in 50K interactions). Ablation studies confirm component effectiveness.

Conclusion: MATWM is highly effective for multi-agent tasks, demonstrating superior coordination and adaptability.

Abstract: We present the Multi-Agent Transformer World Model (MATWM), a novel
transformer-based world model designed for multi-agent reinforcement learning
in both vector- and image-based environments. MATWM combines a decentralized
imagination framework with a semi-centralized critic and a teammate prediction
module, enabling agents to model and anticipate the behavior of others under
partial observability. To address non-stationarity, we incorporate a
prioritized replay mechanism that trains the world model on recent experiences,
allowing it to adapt to agents' evolving policies. We evaluated MATWM on a
broad suite of benchmarks, including the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge,
PettingZoo, and MeltingPot. MATWM achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming both model-free and prior world model approaches, while
demonstrating strong sample efficiency, achieving near-optimal performance in
as few as 50K environment interactions. Ablation studies confirm the impact of
each component, with substantial gains in coordination-heavy tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the dynamics of Lipschitz continuity in neural networks during SGD training using a stochastic differential equation framework, identifying key factors influencing its evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity, which measures network sensitivity to input perturbations, during neural network training.

Method: A mathematical framework based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) models the deterministic and stochastic forces in SGD, focusing on projections of gradient flows and noise onto Jacobian and Hessian matrices.

Result: Identifies three main factors driving Lipschitz continuity evolution: gradient flow projections, gradient noise projections, and Hessian projections. Theoretical insights align with experimental observations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully explains how training dynamics, noise, and hyperparameters influence Lipschitz continuity, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Lipschitz continuity characterizes the worst-case sensitivity of neural
networks to small input perturbations; yet its dynamics (i.e. temporal
evolution) during training remains under-explored. We present a rigorous
mathematical framework to model the temporal evolution of Lipschitz continuity
during training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This framework
leverages a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to capture both
deterministic and stochastic forces. Our theoretical analysis identifies three
principal factors driving the evolution: (i) the projection of gradient flows,
induced by the optimization dynamics, onto the operator-norm Jacobian of
parameter matrices; (ii) the projection of gradient noise, arising from the
randomness in mini-batch sampling, onto the operator-norm Jacobian; and (iii)
the projection of the gradient noise onto the operator-norm Hessian of
parameter matrices. Furthermore, our theoretical framework sheds light on such
as how noisy supervision, parameter initialization, batch size, and mini-batch
sampling trajectories, among other factors, shape the evolution of the
Lipschitz continuity of neural networks. Our experimental results demonstrate
strong agreement between the theoretical implications and the observed
behaviors.

*Mengjian Hua,Eric Vanden-Eijnden,Ricky T. Q. Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simulation-free framework for training continuous-time diffusion processes, avoiding expensive simulations and restricted problem formulations by jointly modeling time-dependent densities and diffusion dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either limit problem formulations or require costly simulations, prompting a need for a more flexible and efficient approach.

Method: Proposes a coupled parameterization that models time-dependent density functions and diffusion dynamics, incorporating the Fokker-Planck equation as a hard constraint.

Result: Enables simulation-free training for diverse objectives, validated in applications like generative modeling and stochastic optimal control.

Conclusion: The framework offers a versatile and efficient solution for training diffusion processes across various domains.

Abstract: We present a novel simulation-free framework for training continuous-time
diffusion processes over very general objective functions. Existing methods
typically involve either prescribing the optimal diffusion process -- which
only works for heavily restricted problem formulations -- or require expensive
simulation to numerically obtain the time-dependent densities and sample from
the diffusion process. In contrast, we propose a coupled parameterization which
jointly models a time-dependent density function, or probability path, and the
dynamics of a diffusion process that generates this probability path. To
accomplish this, our approach directly bakes in the Fokker-Planck equation and
density function requirements as hard constraints, by extending and greatly
simplifying the construction of Neural Conservation Laws. This enables
simulation-free training for a large variety of problem formulations, from
data-driven objectives as in generative modeling and dynamical optimal
transport, to optimality-based objectives as in stochastic optimal control,
with straightforward extensions to mean-field objectives due to the ease of
accessing exact density functions. We validate our method in a diverse range of
application domains from modeling spatio-temporal events to learning optimal

*SimÃ³n Weinberger,Jairo Cugliari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an ordinal regression-based policy for RL to address the softmax limitation of ignoring action order, showing effectiveness in real-world and continuous tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax in RL ignores action order, which is problematic for real-world industrial problems requiring ordered actions.

Method: Introduces a novel policy parametrization using ordinal regression models adapted for RL.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in real applications and competitive performance in continuous action tasks.

Conclusion: Ordinal regression-based policy is a viable alternative to softmax for ordered action spaces in RL.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, the softmax parametrization is the standard
approach for policies over discrete action spaces. However, it fails to capture
the order relationship between actions. Motivated by a real-world industrial
problem, we propose a novel policy parametrization based on ordinal regression
models adapted to the reinforcement learning setting. Our approach addresses
practical challenges, and numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness
in real applications and in continuous action tasks, where discretizing the
action space and applying the ordinal policy yields competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prediction accuracy in ordinal models, especially for functional covariates, and demonstrate practical utility in real-world applications like connected glasses.

Method: Introduces optimal predictions via loss functions, derives Least-Absolute-Deviation predictions, and reformulates ordinal models with functional covariates to scalar covariates.

Result: Proposed methods are illustrated and applied to a dataset from EssilorLuxottica for controlling connected glasses' shade.

Conclusion: The framework enhances ordinal model predictions and shows practical relevance in industrial applications.

Abstract: We present a prediction framework for ordinal models: we introduce optimal
predictions using loss functions and give the explicit form of the
Least-Absolute-Deviation prediction for these models. Then, we reformulate an
ordinal model with functional covariates to a classic ordinal model with
multiple scalar covariates. We illustrate all the proposed methods and try to
apply these to a dataset collected by EssilorLuxottica for the development of a
control algorithm for the shade of connected glasses.

### [442] [Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Design in Photonic Integrated Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18627)
*Yannik Mahlau,Maximilian Schier,Christoph Reinders,Frederik Schubert,Marco BÃ¼gling,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs), outperforming traditional gradient-based methods by avoiding local minima and achieving better results with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional gradient-based optimization for PICs often gets stuck in local minima, leading to suboptimal designs. With growing interest in optical computing, more adaptive methods are needed.

Method: The authors propose a multi-agent RL framework, discretizing the design space into a grid and treating the task as an optimization problem with binary variables. They test this on 2D and 3D PIC components.

Result: The RL algorithms outperform gradient-based methods in both 2D and 3D tasks, achieving optimization with only a few thousand samples.

Conclusion: This work not only advances PIC design but also sets a benchmark for sample-efficient RL in photonic inverse design.

Abstract: Inverse design of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has traditionally
relied on gradientbased optimization. However, this approach is prone to end up
in local minima, which results in suboptimal design functionality. As interest
in PICs increases due to their potential for addressing modern hardware demands
through optical computing, more adaptive optimization algorithms are needed. We
present a reinforcement learning (RL) environment as well as multi-agent RL
algorithms for the design of PICs. By discretizing the design space into a
grid, we formulate the design task as an optimization problem with thousands of
binary variables. We consider multiple two- and three-dimensional design tasks
that represent PIC components for an optical computing system. By decomposing
the design space into thousands of individual agents, our algorithms are able
to optimize designs with only a few thousand environment samples. They
outperform previous state-of-the-art gradient-based optimization in both twoand
three-dimensional design tasks. Our work may also serve as a benchmark for
further exploration of sample-efficient RL for inverse design in photonics.

*Putri A. van der Linden,Alexander Timans,Dharmesh Tailor,Erik J. Bekkers*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores uncertainty-aware methods for selecting equivariant models with varying symmetry biases, comparing frequentist, Bayesian, and calibration-based measures. Bayesian model evidence is inconsistent, attributed to complexity mismatches, but uncertainty metrics generally align with performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of selecting among pretrained equivariant models with varying symmetry biases, which can harm performance if misspecified.

Method: Compares frequentist (Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (marginal likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation for model selection.

Result: Uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently due to complexity mismatches.

Conclusion: Uncertainty metrics show promise for guiding symmetry-aware model selection, though Bayesian methods require further refinement.

Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve
predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it
instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting
among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We
examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective,
comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal
likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We
find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but
Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch
in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity, and discuss possible
remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding
symmetry-aware model selection.

*Shuyin Xia,Yifan Wang,Lifeng Shen,Guoyin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a granular-ball multi-kernel K-means (GB-MKKM) framework to enhance computational efficiency and robustness in clustering complex data distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms struggle with efficiency and robustness due to reliance on point-to-point relationships and complex kernel interplay.

Method: The authors leverage granular-ball computing to adaptively fit data distributions, introducing granular-ball kernels (GBK) and the GB-MKKM framework.

Result: GB-MKKM demonstrates superior efficiency and clustering performance in empirical evaluations.

Conclusion: Granular-ball computing improves multi-kernel clustering by enhancing efficiency and robustness.

Abstract: Most existing multi-kernel clustering algorithms, such as multi-kernel
K-means, often struggle with computational efficiency and robustness when faced
with complex data distributions. These challenges stem from their dependence on
point-to-point relationships for optimization, which can lead to difficulty in
accurately capturing data sets' inherent structure and diversity. Additionally,
the intricate interplay between multiple kernels in such algorithms can further
exacerbate these issues, effectively impacting their ability to cluster data
points in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we leverage granular-ball
computing to improve the multi-kernel clustering framework. The core of
granular-ball computing is to adaptively fit data distribution by balls from
coarse to acceptable levels. Each ball can enclose data points based on a
density consistency measurement. Such ball-based data description thus improves
the computational efficiency and the robustness to unknown noises.
Specifically, based on granular-ball representations, we introduce the
granular-ball kernel (GBK) and its corresponding granular-ball multi-kernel
K-means framework (GB-MKKM) for efficient clustering. Using granular-ball
relationships in multiple kernel spaces, the proposed GB-MKKM framework shows
its superiority in efficiency and clustering performance in the empirical
evaluation of various clustering tasks.

*Christian InternÃ²,Markus Olhofer,Yaochu Jin,Barbara Hammer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLEx is a novel FL method addressing non-IID data challenges by optimizing learning behavior and using a global guidance matrix for efficient knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL methods struggle with non-IID data heterogeneity and lack robustness. FedLEx aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: FedLEx employs federated loss exploration, where clients contribute gradient deviations to a global guidance matrix, guiding updates in subsequent rounds.

Result: FedLEx improves performance in non-IID settings, requiring minimal epochs and data for convergence without additional data sharing.

Conclusion: FedLEx demonstrates significant potential to enhance FL performance in diverse, realistic non-IID scenarios.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a groundbreaking paradigm in machine
learning (ML), offering privacy-preserving collaborative model training across
diverse datasets. Despite its promise, FL faces significant hurdles in
non-identically and independently distributed (non-IID) data scenarios, where
most existing methods often struggle with data heterogeneity and lack
robustness in performance. This paper introduces Federated Loss Exploration
(FedLEx), an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle these
challenges. FedLEx distinctively addresses the shortcomings of existing FL
methods in non-IID settings by optimizing its learning behavior for scenarios
in which assumptions about data heterogeneity are impractical or unknown. It
employs a federated loss exploration technique, where clients contribute to a
global guidance matrix by calculating gradient deviations for model parameters.
This matrix serves as a strategic compass to guide clients' gradient updates in
subsequent FL rounds, thereby fostering optimal parameter updates for the
global model. FedLEx effectively navigates the complex loss surfaces inherent
in non-IID data, enhancing knowledge transfer in an efficient manner, since
only a small number of epochs and small amount of data are required to build a
strong global guidance matrix that can achieve model convergence without the
need for additional data sharing or data distribution statics in a large client
scenario. Our extensive experiments with state-of-the art FL algorithms
demonstrate significant improvements in performance, particularly under
realistic non-IID conditions, thus highlighting FedLEx's potential to overcome
critical barriers in diverse FL applications.

*Steve Hanneke,Amin Karbasi,Anay Mehrotra,Grigoris Velegkas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper resolves open questions about language generation in the limit, showing finite unions of generatable classes need not be generatable and addressing uncountable classes without the EUC condition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility and limitations of language generation in the limit, particularly for uncountable collections and finite unions.

Method: Uses constructed classes and a novel diagonalization argument.

Result: Proves finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be generatable, and identifies uncountable classes without the EUC condition.

Conclusion: Language generation in the limit differs from traditional learning tasks, with implications for combining generators and boosting.

Abstract: We investigate language generation in the limit - a model by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [NeurIPS 2024] and extended by Li, Raman, and Tewari [COLT 2025].
While Kleinberg and Mullainathan proved generation is possible for all
countable collections, Li et al. defined a hierarchy of generation notions
(uniform, non-uniform, and generatable) and explored their feasibility for
uncountable collections.
  Our first set of results resolve two open questions of Li et al. by proving
finite unions of generatable or non-uniformly generatable classes need not be
generatable. These follow from a stronger result: there is a non-uniformly
generatable class and a uniformly generatable class whose union is
non-generatable. This adds to the aspects along which language generation in
the limit is different from traditional tasks in statistical learning theory
like classification, which are closed under finite unions. In particular, it
implies that given two generators for different collections, one cannot combine
them to obtain a single "more powerful" generator, prohibiting this notion of
boosting.
  Our construction also addresses a third open question of Li et al. on whether
there are uncountable classes that are non-uniformly generatable and do not
satisfy the eventually unbounded closure (EUC) condition introduced by Li,
Raman, and Tewari. Our approach utilizes carefully constructed classes along
with a novel diagonalization argument that could be of independent interest in
the growing area of language generation.

*Yuchang Zhu,Jintang Li,Huizhe Zhang,Liang Chen,Zibin Zheng*

TL;DR: The paper addresses individual fairness (IF) in GNNs, introduces metrics for similarity assessment, and proposes SaGIF, a method to improve IF by integrating similarity representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand causes of individual unfairness in GNNs and comprehensively identify similar individuals, bridging gaps in current research.

Method: Introduces two metrics for similarity assessment (topology and feature fusion) and proposes SaGIF, which integrates similarity representations.

Result: SaGIF outperforms state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility, validated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into IF in GNNs, introduces effective metrics, and demonstrates SaGIF's superiority in fairness and performance.

Abstract: Individual fairness (IF) in graph neural networks (GNNs), which emphasizes
the need for similar individuals should receive similar outcomes from GNNs, has
been a critical issue. Despite its importance, research in this area has been
largely unexplored in terms of (1) a clear understanding of what induces
individual unfairness in GNNs and (2) a comprehensive consideration of
identifying similar individuals. To bridge these gaps, we conduct a preliminary
analysis to explore the underlying reason for individual unfairness and observe
correlations between IF and similarity consistency, a concept introduced to
evaluate the discrepancy in identifying similar individuals based on graph
structure versus node features. Inspired by our observations, we introduce two
metrics to assess individual similarity from two distinct perspectives:
topology fusion and feature fusion. Building upon these metrics, we propose
Similarity-aware GNNs for Individual Fairness, named SaGIF. The key insight
behind SaGIF is the integration of individual similarities by independently
learning similarity representations, leading to an improvement of IF in GNNs.
Our experiments on several real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of
our proposed metrics and SaGIF. Specifically, SaGIF consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art IF methods while maintaining utility performance. Code is

*Steven Kolawole,Keshav Santhanam,Virginia Smith,Pratiksha Thaker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PARALLELPROMPT is a benchmark for measuring intra-query parallelism in LLM prompts, showing 75% success in parsing and up to 5x speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM serving systems treat prompts monolithically, missing opportunities for parallelism in decomposable prompts.

Method: A dataset of 37,000 real-world prompts is annotated with structured schemas using LLM-assisted prompting and rule-based validation. An execution suite compares serial vs. parallel strategies.

Result: Over 75% of prompts can be parsed for parallelism, achieving up to 5x speedups in tasks like translation and analysis.

Conclusion: PARALLELPROMPT provides a standardized testbed for structure-aware execution in LLM pipelines.

Abstract: LLM serving systems typically treat user prompts as monolithic inputs,
optimizing inference through decoding tricks or inter-query batching. However,
many real-world prompts contain latent semantic parallelism--decomposable
structures where subtasks can be executed independently to reduce latency while
preserving meaning. We introduce PARALLELPROMPT, the first benchmark for
measuring intra-query parallelism in natural user prompts. Our dataset
comprises over 37,000 real-world prompts from public LLM chat logs, each
annotated with a structured schema capturing task templates, shared context,
and iteration inputs. These schemas are extracted using LLM-assisted prompting
with rule-based multilingual validation. To evaluate the benefits of
decomposition, we provide an execution suite that benchmarks serial vs.
parallel strategies, measuring latency, structural adherence, and semantic
fidelity. Our results show that intra-query parallelism can be successfully
parsed in over 75% of curated datasets, unlocking up to 5x speedups on tasks
like translation, comprehension, and comparative analysis, with minimal quality
degradation. By releasing this benchmark, curation pipeline, and evaluation
suite, we provide the first standardized testbed for studying structure-aware
execution in LLM serving pipelines.

*Yuning Yang,Han Yu,Tianrun Gao,Xiaodong Xu,Guangyu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a causal analysis for group fairness in federated foundation models (FFMs), addressing biases across multiple sensitive attributes to enhance interpretability and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biases in sensitive attributes in FFMs can lead to inequitable treatment, especially for underrepresented groups. Existing methods focus on single attributes, lacking interpretability for multiple attributes.

Method: Extends FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes simultaneously, using causal discovery and inference to quantify causal effects behind group fairness.

Result: Experiments validate the method's effectiveness, providing insights for building trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

Conclusion: The approach advances group fairness in FFMs by addressing multiple sensitive attributes causally, improving interpretability and fairness.

Abstract: The deep integration of foundation models (FM) with federated learning (FL)
enhances personalization and scalability for diverse downstream tasks, making
it crucial in sensitive domains like healthcare. Achieving group fairness has
become an increasingly prominent issue in the era of federated foundation
models (FFMs), since biases in sensitive attributes might lead to inequitable
treatment for under-represented demographic groups. Existing studies mostly
focus on achieving fairness with respect to a single sensitive attribute. This
renders them unable to provide clear interpretability of dependencies among
multiple sensitive attributes which is required to achieve group fairness. Our
paper takes the first attempt towards a causal analysis of the relationship
between group fairness across various sensitive attributes in the FFM. We
extend the FFM structure to trade off multiple sensitive attributes
simultaneously and quantify the causal effect behind the group fairness through
causal discovery and inference. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness, offering insights into interpretability towards building
trustworthy and fair FFM systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores whether transformer encoders can exactly simulate arbitrary attention mechanisms, presenting a universal simulator to replicate attention outputs algorithmically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between learnability and expressivity of transformers, addressing whether they can exactly simulate attention mechanisms without relying on probabilistic guarantees.

Method: Constructs a universal simulator using transformer encoders and RASP, a formal framework, to algorithmically replicate attention outputs and operations.

Result: Proves the existence of a data-agnostic solution for exact simulation, previously only approximated through learning.

Conclusion: Transformer encoders can algorithmically simulate attention mechanisms exactly, providing a theoretical foundation beyond probabilistic guarantees.

Abstract: Prior work on the learnability of transformers has established its capacity
to approximate specific algorithmic patterns through training under restrictive
architectural assumptions. Fundamentally, these arguments remain data-driven
and therefore can only provide a probabilistic guarantee. Expressivity, on the
contrary, has theoretically been explored to address the problems
\emph{computable} by such architecture. These results proved the
Turing-completeness of transformers, investigated bounds focused on circuit
complexity, and formal logic. Being at the crossroad between learnability and
expressivity, the question remains: \emph{can transformer architectures exactly
simulate an arbitrary attention mechanism, or in particular, the underlying
operations?} In this study, we investigate the transformer encoder's ability to
simulate a vanilla attention mechanism. By constructing a universal simulator
$\mathcal{U}$ composed of transformer encoders, we present algorithmic
solutions to identically replicate attention outputs and the underlying
elementary matrix and activation operations via RASP, a formal framework for
transformer computation. Our proofs, for the first time, show the existence of
an algorithmically achievable data-agnostic solution, previously known to be
approximated only by learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel approach combines fast experiments and offline proxies with slow experiments for efficient Bayesian optimization in large action spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing long-term treatment effects in A/B tests is challenging due to non-stationarity and lengthy sequential experimentation.

Method: Combines fast experiments (biased, short-term) and offline proxies with slow experiments for sequential Bayesian optimization.

Result: Enables efficient optimization over large action spaces in shorter timeframes.

Conclusion: The approach addresses the limitations of traditional sequential experimentation by integrating fast and slow methods.

Abstract: Online experiments in internet systems, also known as A/B tests, are used for
a wide range of system tuning problems, such as optimizing recommender system
ranking policies and learning adaptive streaming controllers. Decision-makers
generally wish to optimize for long-term treatment effects of the system
changes, which often requires running experiments for a long time as short-term
measurements can be misleading due to non-stationarity in treatment effects
over time. The sequential experimentation strategies--which typically involve
several iterations--can be prohibitively long in such cases. We describe a
novel approach that combines fast experiments (e.g., biased experiments run
only for a few hours or days) and/or offline proxies (e.g., off-policy
evaluation) with long-running, slow experiments to perform sequential, Bayesian
optimization over large action spaces in a short amount of time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable targeted unlearning in generative models without costly retraining or direct access to unwanted samples.

Method: Uses energy-based reweighting loss and Flow Matching to softly subtract undesired data regions, guided by energy-based proxies.

Result: Validated on 2D and image domains with interpretable visualizations and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: ContinualFlow effectively unlearns undesired data regions using energy-based proxies and Flow Matching.

Abstract: We introduce ContinualFlow, a principled framework for targeted unlearning in
generative models via Flow Matching. Our method leverages an energy-based
reweighting loss to softly subtract undesired regions of the data distribution
without retraining from scratch or requiring direct access to the samples to be
unlearned. Instead, it relies on energy-based proxies to guide the unlearning
process. We prove that this induces gradients equivalent to Flow Matching
toward a soft mass-subtracted target, and validate the framework through
experiments on 2D and image domains, supported by interpretable visualizations
and quantitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in image classification face uncertainties from model, data, and domain shifts, leading to overconfidence. Sensitivity analysis helps understand these models better.

Method: Proposes modeling domain shifts with random variables and quantifying their impact using Sobol indices via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). Validated with a welding defect and emblem classification case study.

Result: The approach is validated using a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification model in BMW Group production, demonstrating effectiveness.

Conclusion: Sensitivity analysis with Sobol indices and GPC effectively addresses uncertainties in image classification models for predictive quality.

Abstract: Integrating advanced communication protocols in production has accelerated
the adoption of data-driven predictive quality methods, notably machine
learning (ML) models. However, ML models in image classification often face
significant uncertainties arising from model, data, and domain shifts. These
uncertainties lead to overconfidence in the classification model's output. To
better understand these models, sensitivity analysis can help to analyze the
relative influence of input parameters on the output. This work investigates
the sensitivity of image classification models used for predictive quality. We
propose modeling the distributional domain shifts of inputs with random
variables and quantifying their impact on the model's outputs using Sobol
indices computed via generalized polynomial chaos (GPC). This approach is
validated through a case study involving a welding defect classification
problem, utilizing a fine-tuned ResNet18 model and an emblem classification
model used in BMW Group production facilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of non-stationary data distributions in streaming FL, which degrades model performance.

Method: Uses Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate shifts, a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse, and facility location-based optimization.

Result: Achieves 5.5-12.9% accuracy improvements and 22-95% faster adaptation compared to FL baselines.

Conclusion: ShiftEx provides a scalable, privacy-preserving solution for FL in dynamic, real-world conditions with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing raw data, yet faces significant
challenges in real-world settings where client data distributions evolve
dynamically over time. This paper tackles the critical problem of covariate and
label shifts in streaming FL environments, where non-stationary data
distributions degrade model performance and require adaptive middleware
solutions. We introduce ShiftEx, a shift-aware mixture of experts framework
that dynamically creates and trains specialized global models in response to
detected distribution shifts using Maximum Mean Discrepancy for covariate
shifts. The framework employs a latent memory mechanism for expert reuse and
implements facility location-based optimization to jointly minimize covariate
mismatch, expert creation costs, and label imbalance. Through theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
5.5-12.9 percentage point accuracy improvements and 22-95 % faster adaptation
compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines across diverse shift scenarios. The
proposed approach offers a scalable, privacy-preserving middleware solution for
FL systems operating in non-stationary, real-world conditions while minimizing
communication and computational overhead.

TL;DR: DCFA_DMP is a multi-view framework for predicting drug-microbe associations, combining adversarial learning and attention mechanisms for feature fusion, showing strong performance and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack effective multi-view feature fusion for drug-microbe association prediction, limiting accuracy and utility in precision medicine.

Method: DCFA_DMP uses adversarial learning in the divergence phase and a bidirectional attention mechanism in the convergence phase, with Transformer graph learning for node relevance.

Result: DCFA_DMP outperforms in predicting drug-microbe associations and handles cold-start scenarios effectively.

Conclusion: The framework is stable, reliable, and effective for predicting potential drug-microbe associations, including for new drugs and microbes.

Abstract: In the study of drug function and precision medicine, identifying new
drug-microbe associations is crucial. However, current methods isolate
association and similarity analysis of drug and microbe, lacking effective
inter-view optimization and coordinated multi-view feature fusion. In our
study, a multi-view Divergence-Convergence Feature Augmentation framework for
Drug-related Microbes Prediction (DCFA_DMP) is proposed, to better learn and
integrate association information and similarity information. In the divergence
phase, DCFA_DMP strengthens the complementarity and diversity between
heterogeneous information and similarity information by performing Adversarial
Learning method between the association network view and different similarity
views, optimizing the feature space. In the convergence phase, a novel
Bidirectional Synergistic Attention Mechanism is proposed to deeply synergize
the complementary features between different views, achieving a deep fusion of
the feature space. Moreover, Transformer graph learning is alternately applied
on the drug-microbe heterogeneous graph, enabling each drug or microbe node to
focus on the most relevant nodes. Numerous experiments demonstrate DCFA_DMP's
significant performance in predicting drug-microbe associations. It also proves
effectiveness in predicting associations for new drugs and microbes in cold
start experiments, further confirming its stability and reliability in
predicting potential drug-microbe associations.

Motivation: Addressing multi-agent control problems with competing, time-varying objectives in fields like robotics, economics, and energy systems.

Method: Investigates gradient-based controllers in an online setting with adversarial disturbances and convex losses, analyzing regret bounds and equilibrium gaps.

Result: Proves near-optimal sublinear regret bounds for all agents and derives equilibrium gap guarantees for aligned objectives.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of multi-agent online control, offering robust regret guarantees and insights into potential games.

Abstract: Multi-agent control problems involving a large number of agents with
competing and time-varying objectives are increasingly prevalent in
applications across robotics, economics, and energy systems. In this paper, we
study online control in multi-agent linear dynamical systems with disturbances.
In contrast to most prior work in multi-agent control, we consider an online
setting where disturbances are adversarial and where each agent seeks to
minimize its own, adversarial sequence of convex losses. In this setting, we
investigate the robustness of gradient-based controllers from single-agent
online control, with a particular focus on understanding how individual regret
guarantees are influenced by the number of agents in the system. Under minimal
communication assumptions, we prove near-optimal sublinear regret bounds that
hold uniformly for all agents. Finally, when the objectives of the agents are
aligned, we show that the multi-agent control problem induces a time-varying
potential game for which we derive equilibrium gap guarantees.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in scaling offline goal-conditioned RL to long-horizon tasks, particularly due to compounding value-estimation errors.

Method: Introduces Projective Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), leveraging asymmetric distance learning, repulsive energy for keypoint coverage, and structured directional cost for sub-goal guidance.

Result: ProQ produces meaningful sub-goals and achieves robust long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse navigation benchmarks.

Conclusion: ProQ effectively unifies metric learning, keypoint coverage, and goal-conditioned control, offering a scalable solution for long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning seeks to train agents to
reach specified goals from previously collected trajectories. Scaling that
promises to long-horizon tasks remains challenging, notably due to compounding
value-estimation errors. Principled geometric offers a potential solution to
address these issues. Following this insight, we introduce Projective
Quasimetric Planning (ProQ), a compositional framework that learns an
asymmetric distance and then repurposes it, firstly as a repulsive energy
forcing a sparse set of keypoints to uniformly spread over the learned latent
space, and secondly as a structured directional cost guiding towards proximal
sub-goals. In particular, ProQ couples this geometry with a Lagrangian
out-of-distribution detector to ensure the learned keypoints stay within
reachable areas. By unifying metric learning, keypoint coverage, and
goal-conditioned control, our approach produces meaningful sub-goals and
robustly drives long-horizon goal-reaching on diverse a navigation benchmarks.

### [458] [Learning Partitions with Optimal Query and Round Complexities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05009)
*Hadley Black,Arya Mazumdar,Barna Saha*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper studies learning an unknown partition of elements using subset queries, focusing on reducing adaptivity while minimizing query complexity. It provides tight bounds for deterministic query complexity and explores generalizations like weak and strong subset queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem is fundamental and relevant to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing, where reducing adaptivity and query complexity is crucial.

Method: The paper uses deterministic algorithms with subset queries (pairwise, weak, and strong) and analyzes their query complexity across varying rounds and subset sizes.

Result: For pairwise queries, the query complexity is Î(n^(1+1/(2^r-1))k^(1-1/(2^r-1)) for r rounds. Non-adaptive weak queries match strong query bounds up to log-factors.

Conclusion: The work provides tight bounds and efficient algorithms for partition learning, balancing adaptivity and query complexity, with implications for practical applications.

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning an unknown partition of $n$
elements into at most $k$ sets using simple queries that reveal information
about a small subset of elements. Our starting point is the well-studied
pairwise same-set queries which ask if a pair of elements belong to the same
class. It is known that non-adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(n^2)$ queries,
while adaptive algorithms require $\Theta(nk)$ queries, and the best known
algorithm uses $k-1$ rounds. This problem has been studied extensively over the
last two decades in multiple communities due to its fundamental nature and
relevance to clustering, active learning, and crowd sourcing. In many
applications, it is of high interest to reduce adaptivity while minimizing
query complexity. We give a complete characterization of the deterministic
query complexity of this problem as a function of the number of rounds, $r$,
interpolating between the non-adaptive and adaptive settings: for any constant
$r$, the query complexity is
$\Theta(n^{1+\frac{1}{2^r-1}}k^{1-\frac{1}{2^r-1}})$. Our algorithm only needs
$O(\log \log n)$ rounds to attain the optimal $O(nk)$ query complexity.
  Next, we consider two generalizations of pairwise queries to subsets $S$ of
size at most $s$: (1) weak subset queries which return the number of classes
intersected by $S$, and (2) strong subset queries which return the entire
partition restricted on $S$. Once again in crowd sourcing applications, queries
on large sets may be prohibitive. For non-adaptive algorithms, we show
$\Omega(n^2/s^2)$ strong queries are needed. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that
there is a non-adaptive algorithm using weak queries that matches this bound up
to log-factors for all $s \leq \sqrt{n}$. More generally, we obtain nearly
matching upper and lower bounds for algorithms using subset queries in terms of
both the number of rounds, $r$, and the query size bound, $s$.

### [459] [Optimal Graph Reconstruction by Counting Connected Components in Induced Subgraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08405)
*Hadley Black,Arya Mazumdar,Barna Saha,Yinzhan Xu*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new query model for graph reconstruction based on connected components, proving adaptive queries require Î(m log n / log m) queries, while non-adaptive ones need Î©(nÂ²). A two-round adaptive algorithm is also provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore graph reconstruction using a novel query model focused on connected components, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Method: Proposes oracle queries returning the number of connected components in induced subgraphs. Analyzes adaptive and non-adaptive query complexities.

Result: Î(m log n / log m) adaptive queries are optimal, while non-adaptive queries require Î©(nÂ²). A two-round adaptive algorithm uses O(m log n + n logÂ² n) queries.

Conclusion: The new query model offers efficient adaptive reconstruction but highlights the inefficiency of non-adaptive methods.

Abstract: The graph reconstruction problem has been extensively studied under various
query models. In this paper, we propose a new query model regarding the number
of connected components, which is one of the most basic and fundamental graph
parameters. Formally, we consider the problem of reconstructing an $n$-node
$m$-edge graph with oracle queries of the following form: provided with a
subset of vertices, the oracle returns the number of connected components in
the induced subgraph. We show $\Theta(\frac{m \log n}{\log m})$ queries in
expectation are both sufficient and necessary to adaptively reconstruct the
graph. In contrast, we show that $\Omega(n^2)$ non-adaptive queries are
required, even when $m = O(n)$. We also provide an $O(m\log n + n\log^2 n)$
query algorithm using only two rounds of adaptivity.

### [460] [Faster Low-Rank Approximation and Kernel Ridge Regression via the Block-NystrÃ¶m Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17556)
*Sachin Garg,MichaÅ DereziÅski*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Block-NystrÃ¶m improves the NystrÃ¶m method by adding block-diagonal structure, reducing computational cost while maintaining strong approximation guarantees for large matrices with heavy-tailed spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The NystrÃ¶m method struggles with heavy-tailed spectral decay, leading to high computational costs. Block-NystrÃ¶m addresses this by leveraging smaller approximations within the same budget.

Method: Block-NystrÃ¶m injects block-diagonal structure into NystrÃ¶m, combining smaller approximations for better spectral tail estimates. It includes a recursive preconditioning scheme for inversion.

Result: The method reduces computational cost, improves preconditioners for optimization, and efficiently solves kernel ridge regression. It provides strong tail estimates and new learning bounds.

Conclusion: Block-NystrÃ¶m is a computationally efficient alternative to NystrÃ¶m for heavy-tailed spectra, with applications in optimization and statistical learning.

Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a popular low-rank approximation technique for large
matrices that arise in kernel methods and convex optimization. Yet, when the
data exhibits heavy-tailed spectral decay, the effective dimension of the
problem often becomes so large that even the Nystr\"om method may be outside of
our computational budget. To address this, we propose Block-Nystr\"om, an
algorithm that injects a block-diagonal structure into the Nystr\"om method,
thereby significantly reducing its computational cost while recovering strong
approximation guarantees. We show that Block-Nystr\"om can be used to construct
improved preconditioners for second-order optimization, as well as to
efficiently solve kernel ridge regression for statistical learning over Hilbert
spaces. Our key technical insight is that, within the same computational
budget, combining several smaller Nystr\"om approximations leads to stronger
tail estimates of the input spectrum than using one larger approximation. Along
the way, we provide a novel recursive preconditioning scheme for efficiently
inverting the Block-Nystr\"om matrix, and provide new statistical learning
bounds for a broad class of approximate kernel ridge regression solvers.

*Timofei Miryashkin,Olga Klimanova,Alexander Shapeev*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: The paper resolves the controversy over the Ti-V binary alloy's miscibility gap using an ab initio + machine-learning workflow, confirming a BCC miscibility gap without oxygen contamination effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify conflicting experimental results about the Ti-V binary alloy's miscibility gap, particularly whether it exists or is caused by oxygen contamination.

Method: An ab initio + machine-learning workflow combining actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential and Bayesian thermodynamic inference.

Result: The study confirms a BCC miscibility gap at T = 980 K and c = 0.67, ruling out oxygen contamination as the cause.

Conclusion: The findings support the existence of a BCC miscibility gap in the Ti-V alloy, contradicting recent CALPHAD reassessments.

Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V)
binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains
completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to
oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this controversy, we
use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained
Moment Tensor Potential to Bayesian thermodynamic inference. Using this
workflow, we obtain Ti-V binary system across the entire composition range,
together with confidence intervals in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting
diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of
our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap
terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because oxygen was excluded from
simulations, the gap cannot be attributed to impurity effects, contradicting
recent CALPHAD reassessments.

TL;DR: A Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model is proposed to predict lithium dendrite growth in batteries, improving accuracy and efficiency by addressing vanishing gradients and enhancing feature retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lithium dendrite growth harms battery performance and safety, causing short circuits and capacity loss. Accurate prediction is crucial for diagnostics and optimization.

Method: The model integrates residual connections into ConvLSTM to improve gradient flow and feature retention. Data is generated using a phase-field model simulating dendrite evolution.

Result: The model achieves 7% higher accuracy and lower MSE than conventional ConvLSTM across voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V).

Conclusion: Residual connections enhance deep spatiotemporal networks for electrochemical modeling, offering a tool for battery diagnostics and future research on other chemistries.

Abstract: The growth of lithium dendrites significantly impacts the performance and
safety of rechargeable batteries, leading to short circuits and capacity
degradation. This study proposes a Residual Connection-Enhanced ConvLSTM model
to predict dendrite growth patterns with improved accuracy and computational
efficiency. By integrating residual connections into ConvLSTM, the model
mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, enhances feature retention across
layers, and effectively captures both localized dendrite growth dynamics and
macroscopic battery behavior. The dataset was generated using a phase-field
model, simulating dendrite evolution under varying conditions. Experimental
results show that the proposed model achieves up to 7% higher accuracy and
significantly reduces mean squared error (MSE) compared to conventional
ConvLSTM across different voltage conditions (0.1V, 0.3V, 0.5V). This
highlights the effectiveness of residual connections in deep spatiotemporal
networks for electrochemical system modeling. The proposed approach offers a
robust tool for battery diagnostics, potentially aiding in real-time monitoring
and optimization of lithium battery performance. Future research can extend
this framework to other battery chemistries and integrate it with real-world
experimental data for further validation

TL;DR: CLOUD is a transformer-based framework for predicting crystal properties using a novel symmetry-consistent encoding, achieving competitive performance and integrating physical principles for generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of conventional methods (experimental/DFT) and existing ML models in predicting crystal properties, which are resource-intensive, lack generalizability, or ignore physical principles.

Method: Introduces CLOUD, a transformer-based model using SCOPE (Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding) for compact, coordinate-free representation of crystal symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition. Pre-trained on 6M+ structures and fine-tuned for various tasks.

Result: CLOUD achieves competitive performance in predicting material properties and demonstrates strong scaling. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework integrates the Debye model for thermodynamic consistency in phonon energy and heat capacity predictions.

Conclusion: CLOUD is a scalable, physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying symmetry-consistent representations with physical learning for accurate property prediction and discovery.

Abstract: The prediction of crystal properties is essential for understanding
structure-property relationships and accelerating the discovery of functional
materials. However, conventional approaches relying on experimental
measurements or density functional theory (DFT) calculations are often
resource-intensive, limiting their scalability. Machine learning (ML) models
offer a promising alternative by learning complex structure-property
relationships from data, enabling faster predictions. Yet, existing ML models
often rely on labeled data, adopt representations that poorly capture essential
structural characteristics, and lack integration with physical
principles--factors that limit their generalizability and interpretability.
Here, we introduce CLOUD (Crystal Language mOdel for Unified and Differentiable
materials modeling), a transformer-based framework trained on a novel
Symmetry-Consistent Ordered Parameter Encoding (SCOPE) that encodes crystal
symmetry, Wyckoff positions, and composition in a compact, coordinate-free
string representation. Pre-trained on over six million crystal structures,
CLOUD is fine-tuned on multiple downstream tasks and achieves competitive
performance in predicting a wide range of material properties, demonstrating
strong scaling performance. Furthermore, as proof of concept of differentiable
materials modeling, CLOUD is applied to predict the phonon internal energy and
heat capacity, which integrates the Debye model to preserve thermodynamic
consistency. The CLOUD-DEBYE framework enforces thermodynamic consistency and
enables temperature-dependent property prediction without requiring additional
data. These results demonstrate the potential of CLOUD as a scalable and
physics-informed foundation model for crystalline materials, unifying
symmetry-consistent representations with physically grounded learning for
property prediction and materials discovery.

TL;DR: HackNIP is a two-stage pipeline using pretrained NIPs to extract embeddings for training shallow ML models, addressing trade-offs in structure-to-property mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NIPs struggle with electronic property prediction and require extensive simulations. ML methods face generalizability or computational challenges.

Method: HackNIP extracts embeddings from NIPs and uses them to train shallow ML models for downstream predictions.

Result: HackNIP outperforms end-to-end deep networks in certain scenarios, is data-efficient, and works across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The hybridization strategy democratizes high-performance predictive modeling in materials science.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models, including neural network interatomic
potentials (NIPs) in computational materials science, have demonstrated
significant potential. However, despite their success in accelerating atomistic
simulations, NIPs face challenges in directly predicting electronic properties
and often require coupling to higher-scale models or extensive simulations for
macroscopic properties. Machine learning (ML) offers alternatives for
structure-to-property mapping but faces trade-offs: feature-based methods often
lack generalizability, while deep neural networks require significant data and
computational power. To address these trade-offs, we introduce HackNIP, a
two-stage pipeline that leverages pretrained NIPs. This method first extracts
fixed-length feature vectors (embeddings) from NIP foundation models and then
uses these embeddings to train shallow ML models for downstream
structure-to-property predictions. This study investigates whether such a
hybridization approach, by ``hacking" the NIP, can outperform end-to-end deep
neural networks, determines the dataset size at which this transfer learning
approach surpasses direct fine-tuning of the NIP, and identifies which NIP
embedding depths yield the most informative features. HackNIP is benchmarked on
Matbench, evaluated for data efficiency, and tested on diverse tasks including
\textit{ab initio}, experimental, and molecular properties. We also analyze how
embedding depth impacts performance. This work demonstrates a hybridization
strategy to overcome ML trade-offs in materials science, aiming to democratize
high-performance predictive modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently simulate heat transfer with a moving source while minimizing computational complexity.

Method: Proposes a continuous time-stepping approach using transfer learning, dividing time into intervals and training a single network sequentially.

Result: Good agreement with traditional finite element method for temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium.

Conclusion: The framework successfully simulates large temporal intervals without increasing network complexity.

Abstract: In this paper, the physics informed neural networks (PINNs) is employed for
the numerical simulation of heat transfer involving a moving source. To reduce
the computational effort, a new training method is proposed that uses a
continuous time-stepping through transfer learning. Within this, the time
interval is divided into smaller intervals and a single network is initialized.
On this single network each time interval is trained with the initial condition
for (n+1)th as the solution obtained at nth time increment. Thus, this
framework enables the computation of large temporal intervals without
increasing the complexity of the network itself. The proposed framework is used
to estimate the temperature distribution in a homogeneous medium with a moving
heat source. The results from the proposed framework is compared with
traditional finite element method and a good agreement is seen.

TL;DR: The paper introduces residual-based loss functions for machine learning in PDEs, focusing on accuracy certification and robust performance, especially for high-contrast diffusion fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prediction capability of deep neural network models for parameter-dependent PDEs through rigorous accuracy certification.

Method: Uses variationally correct loss functions derived from ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG) discretization, demonstrated via an elliptic PDE example.

Result: DPG loss functions outperform simpler least-squares losses, particularly in high-contrast diffusion scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed DPG loss functions are robust and applicable to a wide range of problems with stable DPG formulations.

Abstract: We develop, analyze, and experimentally explore residual-based loss functions
for machine learning of parameter-to-solution maps in the context of
parameter-dependent families of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our
primary concern is on rigorous accuracy certification to enhance prediction
capability of resulting deep neural network reduced models. This is achieved by
the use of variationally correct loss functions. Through one specific example
of an elliptic PDE, details for establishing the variational correctness of a
loss function from an ultraweak Discontinuous Petrov Galerkin (DPG)
discretization are worked out. Despite the focus on the example, the proposed
concepts apply to a much wider scope of problems, namely problems for which
stable DPG formulations are available. The issue of {high-contrast} diffusion
fields and ensuing difficulties with degrading ellipticity are discussed. Both
numerical results and theoretical arguments illustrate that for high-contrast
diffusion parameters the proposed DPG loss functions deliver much more robust
performance than simpler least-squares losses.

TL;DR: A digital twin framework is developed for Gen-IV nuclear reactors, integrating surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference to optimize operations and maintenance while ensuring safety constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High costs hinder Gen-IV reactor deployment; digital twins can reduce costs and improve efficiency.

Method: Combines surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference for online regulation and self-adjustment.

Result: Validated in case studies for long-term maintenance, short-term accuracy, and real-time recalibration.

Conclusion: The framework is robust and applicable to other advanced reactors and complex systems.

Abstract: Generation IV (Gen-IV) nuclear power plants are envisioned to replace the
current reactor fleet, bringing improvements in performance, safety,
reliability, and sustainability. However, large cost investments currently
inhibit the deployment of these advanced reactor concepts. Digital twins bridge
real-world systems with digital tools to reduce costs, enhance decision-making,
and boost operational efficiency. In this work, a digital twin framework is
designed to operate the Gen-IV Fluoride-salt-cooled High-temperature Reactor,
utilizing data-enhanced methods to optimize operational and maintenance
policies while adhering to system constraints. The closed-loop framework
integrates surrogate modeling, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian inference
to streamline end-to-end communication for online regulation and
self-adjustment. Reinforcement learning is used to consider component health
and degradation to drive the target power generations, with constraints
enforced through a Reference Governor control algorithm that ensures compliance
with pump flow rate and temperature limits. These input driving modules benefit
from detailed online simulations that are assimilated to measurement data with
Bayesian filtering. The digital twin is demonstrated in three case studies: a
one-year long-term operational period showcasing maintenance planning
capabilities, short-term accuracy refinement with high-frequency measurements,
and system shock capturing that demonstrates real-time recalibration
capabilities when change in boundary conditions. These demonstrations validate
robustness for health-aware and constraint-informed nuclear plant operation,

TL;DR: A method for ensuring safe control in autonomous agents with imperfect perception by using a shield construction and conformal prediction to guarantee safety under perception errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of providing safety guarantees in autonomous agents that rely on learned components for perception, which can be imperfect.

Method: Proposes a shield construction that restricts agent actions based on state estimates, using conformal prediction to ensure the predicted set includes the actual state with a specified probability.

Result: Provides local safety guarantees by allowing actions only if safe for all state estimates in the predicted set, and proves a global safety property for perfect-perception agents.

Conclusion: The approach is validated with a case study of an autonomous system for airplane taxiway guidance, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: We consider the problem of safe control in discrete autonomous agents that
use learned components for imperfect perception (or more generally, state
estimation) from high-dimensional observations. We propose a shield
construction that provides run-time safety guarantees under perception errors
by restricting the actions available to an agent, modeled as a Markov decision
process, as a function of the state estimates. Our construction uses conformal
prediction for the perception component, which guarantees that for each
observation, the predicted set of estimates includes the actual state with a
user-specified probability. The shield allows an action only if it is allowed
for all the estimates in the predicted set, resulting in a local safety
guarantee. We also articulate and prove a global safety property of existing
shield constructions for perfect-perception agents bounding the probability of
reaching unsafe states if the agent always chooses actions prescribed by the
shield. We illustrate our approach with a case-study of an experimental
autonomous system that guides airplanes on taxiways using high-dimensional
perception DNNs.

Motivation: The rapid growth of AI has led to gigawatt-scale data centers with extreme power dynamics, challenging traditional VPP architectures designed for slower, distributed resources.

Method: A four-layer hierarchical control architecture is developed, with sub-millisecond control, stability criteria for converter-dominated systems, and workload deferability analysis.

Result: The framework reduces critical clearing times from 150 ms to 83 ms and enables 30% peak power reduction while maintaining 99.95% AI service availability.

Conclusion: The work provides mathematical foundations for integrating AI infrastructure, which will dominate data center electricity consumption by 2030.

Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence has created gigawatt-scale
data centers that fundamentally challenge power system operation, exhibiting
power fluctuations exceeding 500 MW within seconds and millisecond-scale
variations of 50-75% of thermal design power. This paper presents a
comprehensive theoretical framework that reconceptualizes Virtual Power Plants
(VPPs) to accommodate these extreme dynamics through a four-layer hierarchical
control architecture operating across timescales from 100 microseconds to 24
hours.
  We develop control mechanisms and stability criteria specifically tailored to
converter-dominated systems with pulsing megawatt-scale loads. We prove that
traditional VPP architectures, designed for aggregating distributed resources
with response times of seconds to minutes, cannot maintain stability when
confronted with AI data center dynamics exhibiting slew rates exceeding 1,000
MW/s at gigawatt scale.
  Our framework introduces: (1) a sub-millisecond control layer that interfaces
with data center power electronics to actively dampen power oscillations; (2)
new stability criteria incorporating protection system dynamics, demonstrating
that critical clearing times reduce from 150 ms to 83 ms for gigawatt-scale
pulsing loads; and (3) quantified flexibility characterization showing that
workload deferability enables 30% peak reduction while maintaining AI service

TL;DR: An incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models combines mechanistic and data-driven components to address computational and conceptual challenges in chemical process optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mathematical models for chemical processes face computational and cost limitations; hybrid models offer a solution but are difficult to identify dynamically.

Method: The approach involves four steps: dynamic parameter estimation, correlation analysis, data-driven model identification, and hybrid model integration.

Result: The method enables early model evaluation, faster development, and independent identification of data-driven components, validated by three case studies.

Conclusion: The incremental approach proves robust, reliable, and efficient for complex systems and limited data scenarios.

Abstract: Mathematical models are crucial for optimizing and controlling chemical
processes, yet they often face significant limitations in terms of
computational time, algorithm complexity, and development costs. Hybrid models,
which combine mechanistic models with data-driven models (i.e. models derived
via the application of machine learning to experimental data), have emerged as
a promising solution to these challenges. However, the identification of
dynamic hybrid models remains difficult due to the need to integrate
data-driven models within mechanistic model structures. We present an
incremental identification approach for dynamic hybrid models that decouples
the mechanistic and data-driven components to overcome computational and
conceptual difficulties. Our methodology comprises four key steps: (1)
regularized dynamic parameter estimation to determine optimal time profiles for
flux variables, (2) correlation analysis to evaluate relationships between
variables, (3) data-driven model identification using advanced machine learning
techniques, and (4) hybrid model integration to combine the mechanistic and
data-driven components. This approach facilitates early evaluation of model
structure suitability, accelerates the development of hybrid models, and allows
for independent identification of data-driven components. Three case studies
are presented to illustrate the robustness, reliability, and efficiency of our
incremental approach in handling complex systems and scenarios with limited
data.

*Waleed Breesam,Rezvan Alamian,Nima Tashakor,Brahim Elkhalil Youcefa,Stefan M. Goetz*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fuzzy neural network controller to dynamically adjust virtual synchronous generator parameters, improving frequency regulation in microgrids with renewable energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shift to renewable energy reduces system inertia and damping, causing frequency instability. Fixed parameters in virtual synchronous generators fail to ensure stable frequency regulation.

Method: A fuzzy neural network controller dynamically adjusts inertia, damping, and droop parameters, training online for optimal values. The method is tested in MATLAB/Simulink and validated with hardware-in-the-loop.

Result: The proposed method reduces frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens recovery time compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controllers.

Conclusion: Dynamic parameter adjustment via fuzzy neural networks offers a robust solution for stable frequency regulation in renewable-rich microgrids.

Abstract: The reliance on distributed renewable energy has increased recently. As a
result, power electronic-based distributed generators replaced synchronous
generators which led to a change in the dynamic characteristics of the
microgrid. Most critically, they reduced system inertia and damping. Virtual
synchronous generators emulated in power electronics, which mimic the dynamic
behaviour of synchronous generators, are meant to fix this problem. However,
fixed virtual synchronous generator parameters cannot guarantee a frequency
regulation within the acceptable tolerance range. Conversely, a dynamic
adjustment of these virtual parameters promises robust solution with stable
frequency. This paper proposes a method to adapt the inertia, damping, and
droop parameters dynamically through a fuzzy neural network controller. This
controller trains itself online to choose appropriate values for these virtual
parameters. The proposed method can be applied to a typical AC microgrid by
considering the penetration and impact of renewable energy sources. We study
the system in a MATLAB/Simulink model and validate it experimentally in real
time using hardware-in-the-loop based on an embedded ARM system (SAM3X8E,
Cortex-M3). Compared to traditional and fuzzy logic controller methods, the
results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the
frequency deviation to less than 0.03 Hz and shortens the stabilizing/recovery

### [472] [Wisdom of Crowds Through Myopic Self-Confidence Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18195)
*Giacomo Como,Fabio Fagnani,Anton Proskurnikov*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper explores how groups of agents improve collective decision-making accuracy through iterative learning, analyzing game-theoretic optimization and convergence to Nash equilibria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how agents with noisy, unbiased measurements can iteratively refine their estimates of a common state, minimizing variance through distributed averaging and game-theoretic optimization.

Method: Agents update estimates using French-DeGroot dynamics (iterative opinion pooling), solving a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize variance, characterized by Pareto frontier and Nash equilibria.

Result: The study characterizes Pareto optimality and Nash equilibria in the game, proving convergence of best-response dynamics to strict Nash equilibria.

Conclusion: Iterative learning and game-theoretic optimization enable agents to achieve accurate collective estimates, with convergence to stable equilibria.

Abstract: The wisdom of crowds is an umbrella term for phenomena suggesting that the
collective judgment or decision of a large group can be more accurate than the
individual judgments or decisions of the group members. A well-known example
illustrating this concept is the competition at a country fair described by
Galton, where the median value of the individual guesses about the weight of an
ox resulted in an astonishingly accurate estimate of the actual weight. This
phenomenon resembles classical results in probability theory and relies on
independent decision-making. The accuracy of the group's final decision can be
significantly reduced if the final agents' opinions are driven by a few
influential agents.
  In this paper, we consider a group of agents who initially possess
uncorrelated and unbiased noisy measurements of a common state of the world.
Assume these agents iteratively update their estimates according to a simple
non-Bayesian learning rule, commonly known in mathematical sociology as the
French-DeGroot dynamics or iterative opinion pooling. As a result of this
iterative distributed averaging process, each agent arrives at an asymptotic
estimate of the state of the world, with the variance of this estimate
determined by the matrix of weights the agents assign to each other. Every
agent aims at minimizing the variance of her asymptotic estimate of the state
of the world; however, such variance is also influenced by the weights
allocated by other agents. To achieve the best possible estimate, the agents
must then solve a game-theoretic, multi-objective optimization problem defined
by the available sets of influence weights. We characterize both the Pareto
frontier and the set of Nash equilibria in the resulting game. Additionally, we
examine asynchronous best-response dynamics for the group of agents and prove
their convergence to the set of strict Nash equilibria.

### [473] [Greedy Selection under Independent Increments: A Toy Model Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17941)
*Huitao Yang*

Main category: math.PR

TL;DR: The paper proves that greedy selection is optimal for maximizing the final value in a multi-stage elimination problem with independent processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To justify greedy heuristics in multi-stage elimination settings and provide a simple model for understanding related algorithms.

Method: Analyzes an iterative selection problem over N i.i.d. discrete-time stochastic processes with independent increments, using greedy selection at each stage.

Result: Greedy selection is optimal for selecting the final maximum-value process under strong independence assumptions.

Conclusion: The result supports the use of greedy heuristics in similar settings and serves as a foundational example for high-dimensional applications.

Abstract: We study an iterative selection problem over N i.i.d. discrete-time
stochastic processes with independent increments. At each stage, a fixed number
of processes are retained based on their observed values. Under this simple
model, we prove that the optimal strategy for selecting the final maximum-value
process is to apply greedy selection at each stage. While the result relies on
strong independence assumptions, it offers a clean justification for greedy
heuristics in multi-stage elimination settings and may serve as a toy example
for understanding related algorithms in high-dimensional applications.

### [474] [Can Generated Images Serve as a Viable Modality for Text-Centric Multimodal Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17623)
*Yuesheng Huang,Peng Zhang,Riliang Liu,Jiaqi Liang*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper explores using text-to-image (T2I) models to generate images for text-centric tasks, showing performance gains but highlighting dependencies on semantic alignment, task visual groundability, and T2I model quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the modality gap between text-only data and multimodal models by investigating if T2I-generated images can enhance text-centric tasks.

Method: Systematic evaluation of T2I models for text classification, analyzing variables like model quality, prompt engineering, and fusion architectures.

Result: Synthetic perception via T2I models improves performance but is highly conditional on alignment, task visual groundability, and T2I fidelity.

Conclusion: The study establishes a benchmark for using T2I models in unimodal tasks, highlighting their potential and current limitations for enriching language understanding.

Abstract: A significant ``modality gap" exists between the abundance of text-only data
and the increasing power of multimodal models. This work systematically
investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models
can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through
a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the
impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering
strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that
this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when
augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the
effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on
the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent
``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I
model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm,
providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and
demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in
traditionally unimodal scenarios.

*Alican Gok,Oguzhan Buyuksolak,Osman Erman Okman,Murat Saraclar*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a training scheme for Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FS-KWS) using self-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge distillation to improve accuracy in resource-constrained edge environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FS-KWS systems have low accuracy at desired false acceptance rates, especially in edge environments, necessitating a more robust and efficient solution.

Method: The method involves a teacher model (Wav2Vec 2.0) trained with Sub-center ArcFace loss for feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and a lightweight ResNet15 student model for deployment.

Result: The approach improves 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on the GSC dataset at 1% false alarm rate.

Conclusion: The proposed training scheme significantly enhances FS-KWS performance, making it practical for real-world edge device applications.

Abstract: Keyword Spotting plays a critical role in enabling hands-free interaction for
battery-powered edge devices. Few-Shot Keyword Spotting (FS-KWS) addresses the
scalability and adaptability challenges of traditional systems by enabling
recognition of custom keywords with only a few examples. However, existing
FS-KWS systems achieve subpar accuracy at desirable false acceptance rates,
particularly in resource-constrained edge environments. To address these
issues, we propose a training scheme that leverages self-supervised learning
models for robust feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and knowledge
distillation. The teacher model, based on Wav2Vec 2.0 is trained using
Sub-center ArcFace loss, which enhances inter-class separability and
intra-class compactness. To enable efficient deployment on edge devices, we
introduce attention-based dimensionality reduction and train a standard
lightweight ResNet15 student model. We evaluate the proposed approach on the
English portion of the Multilingual Spoken Words Corpus (MSWC) and the Google
Speech Commands (GSC) datasets. Notably, the proposed training method improves
the 10-shot classification accuracy from 33.4% to 74.1% on 11 classes at 1%
false alarm accuracy on the GSC dataset, thus making it significantly
better-suited for a real use case scenario.

### [476] [Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17229)
*Kenric P. Nelson*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE) and its instability, proposing the coupled entropy as a robust alternative for complex systems like machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the instability of NTE and provide a robust entropy measure for complex systems.

Method: Introduces the coupled entropy, dividing NTE by a factor involving dimension and coupling, and derives the coupled exponential family.

Result: The coupled entropy offers stability and robustness, making it suitable for applications like machine learning.

Conclusion: The coupling parameter is a promising measure of statistical complexity in complex systems.

Abstract: Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful
toolset for modeling and analyzing complex systems. Despite its many successes,
a puzzle arose early in its development. The constraints on the Tsallis entropy
are in the form of an escort distribution with elements proportional to
$p_i^q$, but this same factor within the Tsallis entropy function is not
normalized. This led to consideration of the Normalized Tsallis Entropy (NTE);
however, the normalization proved to make the function unstable. I will provide
evidence that the coupled entropy, which divides NTE by $1 + d\kappa$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $\kappa$ is the coupling, may provide the necessary
robustness necessary for applications like machine learning. The definition for
the coupled entropy and its maximizing distributions, the coupled exponential
family, arises from clarifying how the number of independent random variables
$(q)$ is composed of the nonlinear properties of complex systems,
$q=1+\frac{\alpha\kappa}{1+d\kappa}$, where $\alpha$ is the nonlinear parameter
governing the shape of distributions near their location and $\kappa$ is the
parameter determining the asymptotic tail decay. Foundationally, for complex
systems, the coupling is the measure of nonlinearity inducing non-exponential
distributions and the degree of nonadditivity entropy. As such, the coupling is
a strong candidate as a measure of statistical complexity.

### [477] [Differentiable neural network representation of multi-well, locally-convex potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17242)
*Reese E. Jones,Adrian Buganza Tepole,Jan N. Fuhg*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces a differentiable and convex method, LSE-ICNN, for modeling multi-well potentials, enabling gradient-based learning and adaptive mode discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-well potentials are common in science but often non-smooth. The goal is to create a differentiable, convex alternative for better modeling and inference.

Method: Proposes a log-sum-exponential mixture of input convex neural networks (LSE-ICNN), retaining convexity within basins and allowing gradient-based learning.

Result: LSE-ICNN successfully models diverse phenomena like phase transitions and gene circuits, demonstrating adaptability and parsimony.

Conclusion: LSE-ICNN is versatile, effective for multimodal landscapes, and broadly applicable in data-driven modeling and physical simulations.

Abstract: Multi-well potentials are ubiquitous in science, modeling phenomena such as
phase transitions, dynamic instabilities, and multimodal behavior across
physics, chemistry, and biology. In contrast to non-smooth minimum-of-mixture
representations, we propose a differentiable and convex formulation based on a
log-sum-exponential (LSE) mixture of input convex neural network (ICNN) modes.
This log-sum-exponential input convex neural network (LSE-ICNN) provides a
smooth surrogate that retains convexity within basins and allows for
gradient-based learning and inference.
  A key feature of the LSE-ICNN is its ability to automatically discover both
the number of modes and the scale of transitions through sparse regression,
enabling adaptive and parsimonious modeling. We demonstrate the versatility of
the LSE-ICNN across diverse domains, including mechanochemical phase
transformations, microstructural elastic instabilities, conservative biological
gene circuits, and variational inference for multimodal probability
distributions. These examples highlight the effectiveness of the LSE-ICNN in
capturing complex multimodal landscapes while preserving differentiability,
making it broadly applicable in data-driven modeling, optimization, and
physical simulation.

*Motonobu Kanagawa,Philipp Hennig,Dino Sejdinovic,Bharath K. Sriperumbudur*

TL;DR: The monograph explores connections between Gaussian processes (probabilistic) and RKHS (non-probabilistic) methods, unifying them via Gaussian Hilbert space and RKHS equivalence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between probabilistic (Gaussian processes) and non-probabilistic (RKHS) approaches in machine learning, statistics, and numerical analysis.

Method: Reviewing connections and equivalences in regression, interpolation, numerical integration, distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence.

Result: Establishes a unifying perspective based on the equivalence between Gaussian Hilbert space and RKHS.

Conclusion: The monograph serves as a foundation to connect parallel developments in Gaussian processes and RKHS methods.

Abstract: This monograph studies the relations between two approaches using positive
definite kernels: probabilistic methods using Gaussian processes, and
non-probabilistic methods using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). They
are widely studied and used in machine learning, statistics, and numerical
analysis. Connections and equivalences between them are reviewed for
fundamental topics such as regression, interpolation, numerical integration,
distributional discrepancies, and statistical dependence, as well as for sample
path properties of Gaussian processes. A unifying perspective for these
equivalences is established, based on the equivalence between the Gaussian
Hilbert space and the RKHS. The monograph serves as a basis to bridge many
other methods based on Gaussian processes and reproducing kernels, which are
developed in parallel by the two research communities.

### [479] [Scalable Machine Learning Algorithms using Path Signatures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17634)
*Csaba TÃ³th*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores using path signatures in machine learning for sequential and structured data, introducing scalable models like Gaussian processes with signature kernels and Seq2Tens for long-range dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in real-world time series and graph data, such as irregular sampling and long-range dependencies, by leveraging path signatures for robust feature representation.

Method: Combines path signatures with Gaussian processes, deep learning, and kernel methods, introducing models like signature kernel-based Gaussian processes, Seq2Tens, and graph-based models with expected signatures.

Result: Develops scalable and theoretically robust models, including Random Fourier Signature Features and Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, for uncertainty-aware and adaptive forecasting.

Conclusion: The thesis provides a methodological toolkit and conceptual bridge for scalable, signature-based learning, advancing the field of sequential and structured data analysis.

Abstract: The interface between stochastic analysis and machine learning is a rapidly
evolving field, with path signatures - iterated integrals that provide
faithful, hierarchical representations of paths - offering a principled and
universal feature map for sequential and structured data. Rooted in rough path
theory, path signatures are invariant to reparameterization and well-suited for
modelling evolving dynamics, long-range dependencies, and irregular sampling -
common challenges in real-world time series and graph data.
  This thesis investigates how to harness the expressive power of path
signatures within scalable machine learning pipelines. It introduces a suite of
models that combine theoretical robustness with computational efficiency,
bridging rough path theory with probabilistic modelling, deep learning, and
kernel methods. Key contributions include: Gaussian processes with signature
kernel-based covariance functions for uncertainty-aware time series modelling;
the Seq2Tens framework, which employs low-rank tensor structure in the weight
space for scalable deep modelling of long-range dependencies; and graph-based
models where expected signatures over graphs induce hypo-elliptic diffusion
processes, offering expressive yet tractable alternatives to standard graph
neural networks. Further developments include Random Fourier Signature
Features, a scalable kernel approximation with theoretical guarantees, and
Recurrent Sparse Spectrum Signature Gaussian Processes, which combine Gaussian
processes, signature kernels, and random features with a principled forgetting
mechanism for multi-horizon time series forecasting with adaptive context
length.
  We hope this thesis serves as both a methodological toolkit and a conceptual
bridge, and provides a useful reference for the current state of the art in
scalable, signature-based learning for sequential and structured data.

### [480] [DRO-Augment Framework: Robustness by Synergizing Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17874)
*Jiaming Hu,Debarghya Mukherjee,Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: DRO-Augment combines Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (W-DRO) with data augmentation to enhance DNN robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks, outperforming existing methods while maintaining clean dataset accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving DNN robustness against input perturbations and adversarial attacks, where current data augmentation methods fall short.

Method: Integrates W-DRO with data augmentation strategies to train models resilient to corruptions and adversarial scenarios.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10-C, MNIST) under severe perturbations and attacks, with maintained clean dataset accuracy.

Conclusion: DRO-Augment effectively enhances DNN robustness, supported by theoretical generalization bounds for the proposed method.

Abstract: In many real-world applications, ensuring the robustness and stability of
deep neural networks (DNNs) is crucial, particularly for image classification
tasks that encounter various input perturbations. While data augmentation
techniques have been widely adopted to enhance the resilience of a trained
model against such perturbations, there remains significant room for
improvement in robustness against corrupted data and adversarial attacks
simultaneously. To address this challenge, we introduce DRO-Augment, a novel
framework that integrates Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization
(W-DRO) with various data augmentation strategies to improve the robustness of
the models significantly across a broad spectrum of corruptions. Our method
outperforms existing augmentation methods under severe data perturbations and
adversarial attack scenarios while maintaining the accuracy on the clean
datasets on a range of benchmark datasets, including but not limited to
CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST. On the theoretical side, we
establish novel generalization error bounds for neural networks trained using a
computationally efficient, variation-regularized loss function closely related
to the W-DRO problem.

*BalÃ¡zs CsanÃ¡d CsÃ¡ji,BÃ¡lint HorvÃ¡th*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Refinement of a method for constructing confidence regions for band-limited functions using kernel norm bounds and majority voting, validated numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Band-limited functions are crucial in systems theory and signal processing, requiring accurate confidence regions from noisy measurements.

Method: Uses Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space, tightens kernel norm bounds with randomized Hoeffding's inequality and empirical Bernstein bound, and applies majority voting for stability.

Result: Derives a threshold for bound selection and proves aggregated intervals retain coverage guarantees. Numerical experiments validate refinements.

Conclusion: The refined method improves confidence region construction for band-limited functions, ensuring coverage and stability.

Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in
systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent
nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence
regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by
working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds
are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small
samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an
approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs
are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to
aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and
region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their
simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through
numerical experiments.

*William Chung*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: ICCNLS is a nonparametric regression method decomposing functions into convex and concave components with orthogonality constraints for identifiability and improved interpretability, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex input-output relationships with interpretable decompositions and avoid affine ambiguity in convex-concave methods.

Method: Decomposes functions into convex and concave components using sub-gradient-constrained affine functions, with orthogonality constraints and L1/L2/elastic net regularization.

Result: Outperforms CNLS and DC regression in predictive accuracy and model simplicity on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ICCNLS provides interpretable, accurate models for forecasting, benchmarking, and policy evaluation by combining identifiability, structure, and regularization.

Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric regression method that models complex
input-output relationships as the sum of convex and concave components. The
method-Identifiable Convex-Concave Nonparametric Least Squares
(ICCNLS)-decomposes the target function into additive shape-constrained
components, each represented via sub-gradient-constrained affine functions. To
address the affine ambiguity inherent in convex-concave decompositions, we
introduce global statistical orthogonality constraints, ensuring that residuals
are uncorrelated with both intercept and input variables. This enforces
decomposition identifiability and improves interpretability. We further
incorporate L1, L2 and elastic net regularisation on sub-gradients to enhance
generalisation and promote structural sparsity. The proposed method is
evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, including healthcare pricing
data, and demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and model simplicity
compared to conventional CNLS and difference-of-convex (DC) regression
approaches. Our results show that statistical identifiability, when paired with
convex-concave structure and sub-gradient regularisation, yields interpretable
models suited for forecasting, benchmarking, and policy evaluation.

### [483] [Phase transition of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18275)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores the theoretical limits of descending phase retrieval algorithms using Random Duality Theory (RDT), identifying parametric manifolds and funneling points as key to algorithm behavior. It establishes a phase transition in sample complexity and validates findings with simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical boundaries and behavior of descending phase retrieval algorithms, particularly how sample complexity affects their success or failure.

Method: The study employs Random Duality Theory (RDT) to analyze algorithmic performance, focusing on parametric manifolds and funneling points. A hybrid algorithm combining barrier and gradient descent is also implemented.

Result: A phase transition is observed where increasing sample complexity shifts the parametric manifold from multi to single funneling points, enabling algorithm success. Simulations align with theoretical predictions.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the critical role of parametric manifolds and funneling points in algorithm performance, with practical implications for phase retrieval in finite dimensions.

Abstract: We study theoretical limits of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms.
Utilizing \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) we develop a generic program that
allows statistical characterization of various algorithmic performance metrics.
Through these we identify the concepts of \emph{parametric manifold} and its
\emph{funneling points} as key mathematical objects that govern the underlying
algorithms' behavior. An isomorphism between single funneling point manifolds
and global convergence of descending algorithms is established. The structure
and shape of the parametric manifold as well as its dependence on the sample
complexity are studied through both plain and lifted RDT. Emergence of a phase
transition is observed. Namely, as sample complexity increases, parametric
manifold transitions from a multi to a single funneling point structure. This
in return corresponds to a transition from the scenarios where descending
algorithms generically fail to the scenarios where they succeed in solving
phase retrieval. We also develop and implement a practical algorithmic variant
that in a hybrid alternating fashion combines a barrier and a plain gradient
descent. Even though the theoretical results are obtained for infinite
dimensional scenarios (and consequently non-jittery parametric manifolds), we
observe a strong agrement between theoretical and simulated phase transitions
predictions for fairly small dimensions on the order of a few hundreds.

### [484] [Optimal spectral initializers impact on phase retrieval phase transitions -- an RDT view](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18279)
*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper explores spectral initializers (OptSpins) in descending phase retrieval (dPR) algorithms, using Random Duality Theory (RDT) to analyze their overlap with true signals and their impact on overcoming flat regions in parametric manifolds (PM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how spectral initializers affect dPR algorithms' ability to solve phase retrieval (PR) by analyzing their starting overlaps and the role of flat regions in PM.

Method: Develops an RDT-based program to statistically characterize OptSpins, evaluates their starting overlaps, and studies their impact on dPR performance.

Result: Finds that flat regions in PM hinder dPR performance, but increasing sample complexity (Î±) by 15% shrinks these regions, enabling successful PR.

Conclusion: OptSpins' starting overlap is crucial for dPR success, and slight adjustments to Î± can mitigate flat region challenges, aligning theory with simulations.

Abstract: We analyze the relation between spectral initializers and theoretical limits
of \emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR). In companion paper
[104], for any sample complexity ratio, $\alpha$, \emph{parametric manifold},
${\mathcal {PM}}(\alpha)$, is recognized as a critically important structure
that generically determines dPRs abilities to solve phase retrieval (PR).
Moreover, overlap between the algorithmic solution and the true signal is
positioned as a key ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s component. We here consider the
so-called \emph{overlap optimal} spectral initializers (OptSpins) as dPR's
starting points and develop a generic \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT) based
program to statistically characterize them. In particular, we determine the
functional structure of OptSpins and evaluate the starting overlaps that they
provide for the dPRs. Since ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s so-called \emph{flat regions}
are highly susceptible to \emph{local jitteriness} and as such are key
obstacles on dPR's path towards PR's global optimum, a precise characterization
of the starting overlap allows to determine if such regions can be successfully
circumvented. Through the presented theoretical analysis we observe two key
points in that regard: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} dPR's theoretical phase transition
(critical $\alpha$ above which they solve PR) might be difficult to practically
achieve as the ${\mathcal {PM}}$'s flat regions are large causing the
associated OptSpins to fall exactly within them; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}}
Opting for so-called ``\emph{safer compression}'' and slightly increasing
$\alpha$ (by say $15\%$) shrinks flat regions and allows OptSpins to fall
outside them and dPRs to ultimately solve PR. Numerical simulations are
conducted as well and shown to be in an excellent agreement with theoretical
predictions.

*Mihailo Stojnic*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper generalizes the Random Duality Theory (RDT) to analyze rank $d$ positive definite phase retrieval (PR) measurements, showing phase transitions in minimal sample complexity for descending PR algorithms. Theoretical predictions align well with simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the RDT framework for analyzing descending phase retrieval algorithms to higher-rank PR measurements and validate theoretical findings with practical implementations.

Method: Generalizes RDT to handle rank $d$ PR measurements, focusing on phase transitions in sample complexity. Implements a log barrier gradient descent variant for validation.

Result: Observes phase transitions in minimal sample complexity for descending PR algorithms. Simulations confirm theoretical predictions even in small dimensions.

Conclusion: The generalized RDT framework effectively predicts phase transitions in PR algorithms, validated by simulations, enhancing understanding of performance limits.

Abstract: Companion paper [118] developed a powerful \emph{Random duality theory} (RDT)
based analytical program to statistically characterize performance of
\emph{descending} phase retrieval algorithms (dPR) (these include all variants
of gradient descents and among them widely popular Wirtinger flows). We here
generalize the program and show how it can be utilized to handle rank $d$
positive definite phase retrieval (PR) measurements (with special cases $d=1$
and $d=2$ serving as emulations of the real and complex phase retrievals,
respectively). In particular, we observe that the minimal sample complexity
ratio (number of measurements scaled by the dimension of the unknown signal)
which ensures dPR's success exhibits a phase transition (PT) phenomenon. For
both plain and lifted RDT we determine phase transitions locations. To
complement theoretical results we implement a log barrier gradient descent
variant and observe that, even in small dimensional scenarios (with problem
sizes on the order of 100), the simulated phase transitions are in an excellent
agreement with the theoretical predictions.

### [486] [Quantifying Uncertainty in the Presence of Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18283)
*Yuli Slavutsky,David M. Blei*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A Bayesian framework with adaptive priors improves uncertainty estimation in neural networks under covariate shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks lack reliable uncertainty estimates, especially under covariate shifts between training and testing.

Method: Proposes an adaptive prior conditioned on training and new covariates, using amortized variational inference for efficient approximation.

Result: Substantially improved uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts, validated on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The adaptive prior framework effectively addresses uncertainty estimation challenges in covariate shift scenarios.

Abstract: Neural networks make accurate predictions but often fail to provide reliable
uncertainty estimates, especially under covariate distribution shifts between
training and testing. To address this problem, we propose a Bayesian framework
for uncertainty estimation that explicitly accounts for covariate shifts. While
conventional approaches rely on fixed priors, the key idea of our method is an
adaptive prior, conditioned on both training and new covariates. This prior
naturally increases uncertainty for inputs that lie far from the training
distribution in regions where predictive performance is likely to degrade. To
efficiently approximate the resulting posterior predictive distribution, we
employ amortized variational inference. Finally, we construct synthetic
environments by drawing small bootstrap samples from the training data,
simulating a range of plausible covariate shift using only the original
dataset. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data. It
yields substantially improved uncertainty estimates under distribution shifts.

*Almut RÃ¶dder,Manuel Hentschel,Sebastian Engelke*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Neural estimators are simulation-based, deep learning-driven tools for parameter estimation, offering efficiency and versatility. This paper provides theoretical guarantees for their performance by decomposing and analyzing their risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the empirical success of neural estimators, there's a lack of theoretical backing. This work aims to bridge that gap by analyzing their risk and providing guarantees.

Method: The study decomposes the risk of neural estimators into analyzable terms, formulates assumptions for convergence, and verifies them in popular applications.

Result: The paper demonstrates that each risk term converges to zero under specific conditions, validating the theoretical soundness of neural estimators.

Conclusion: The findings offer a framework for extending theoretical guarantees to broader neural estimator architectures and estimation problems.

Abstract: Neural estimators are simulation-based estimators for the parameters of a
family of statistical models, which build a direct mapping from the sample to
the parameter vector. They benefit from the versatility of available network
architectures and efficient training methods developed in the field of deep
learning. Neural estimators are amortized in the sense that, once trained, they
can be applied to any new data set with almost no computational cost. While
many papers have shown very good performance of these methods in simulation
studies and real-world applications, so far no statistical guarantees are
available to support these observations theoretically. In this work, we study
the risk of neural estimators by decomposing it into several terms that can be
analyzed separately. We formulate easy-to-check assumptions ensuring that each
term converges to zero, and we verify them for popular applications of neural
estimators. Our results provide a general recipe to derive theoretical
guarantees also for broader classes of architectures and estimation problems.

### [488] [Trustworthy Prediction with Gaussian Process Knowledge Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18630)
*Kurt Butler,Guanchao Feng,Tong Chen,Petar Djuric*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A knowledge score for Gaussian process regression (GPR) models is introduced to quantify prediction uncertainty reduction from observed data, improving tasks like anomaly detection and imputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address uncertainty in predictions made by probabilistic models, especially in data-sparse regions, by providing a measurable score.

Method: Proposes a knowledge score for GPR models, bounded between 0 and 1, to assess how much observed data reduces prediction uncertainty.

Result: The knowledge score effectively anticipates prediction accuracy, enhancing performance in anomaly detection, extrapolation, and imputation.

Conclusion: The knowledge score is a valuable tool for evaluating GPR model predictions, ensuring reliability in uncertain regions.

Abstract: Probabilistic models are often used to make predictions in regions of the
data space where no observations are available, but it is not always clear
whether such predictions are well-informed by previously seen data. In this
paper, we propose a knowledge score for predictions from Gaussian process
regression (GPR) models that quantifies the extent to which observing data have
reduced our uncertainty about a prediction. The knowledge score is
interpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1. We demonstrate in several
experiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR
model are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks
such as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation. Source

### [489] [Tight Generalization Error Bounds for Stochastic Gradient Descent in Non-convex Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18645)
*Wenjun Xiong,Juan Ding,Xinlei Zuo,Qizhai Li*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces T2pm-SGD, a variant of SGD, to improve generalization error bounds for non-convex learning, achieving tighter bounds for both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and improving SGD's generalization properties for robust model performance on unseen data.

Method: Introduces T2pm-SGD, decomposing generalization error into trajectory and flatness terms, optimizing perturbation noise variance.

Result: Improved trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$ for bounded losses and $O(n^{-2/3})$ overall. Stable flatness term outperforms prior work.

Conclusion: T2pm-SGD effectively tightens generalization bounds, validated by experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10.

Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is fundamental for training deep neural
networks, especially in non-convex settings. Understanding SGD's generalization
properties is crucial for ensuring robust model performance on unseen data. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization error bounds of SGD for non-convex
learning by introducing the Type II perturbed SGD (T2pm-SGD), which
accommodates both sub-Gaussian and bounded loss functions. The generalization
error bound is decomposed into two components: the trajectory term and the
flatness term. Our analysis improves the trajectory term to $O(n^{-1})$,
significantly enhancing the previous $O((nb)^{-1/2})$ bound for bounded losses,
where n is the number of training samples and b is the batch size. By selecting
an optimal variance for the perturbation noise, the overall bound is further
refined to $O(n^{-2/3})$. For sub-Gaussian loss functions, a tighter trajectory
term is also achieved. In both cases, the flatness term remains stable across
iterations and is smaller than those reported in previous literature, which
increase with iterations. This stability, ensured by T2pm-SGD, leads to tighter
generalization error bounds for both loss function types. Our theoretical
results are validated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets,
including MNIST and CIFAR-10, demonstrating the effectiveness of T2pm-SGD in
establishing tighter generalization bounds.

### [490] [A Random Matrix Analysis of In-context Memorization for Nonlinear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18656)
*Zhenyu Liao,Jiaqing Liu,TianQi Hou,Difan Zou,Zenan Ling*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the memorization error of nonlinear Attention in high-dimensional settings, comparing it to linear ridge regression and highlighting the role of input structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of nonlinear Attention mechanisms in large language models (LLMs).

Method: Leveraging large kernel random matrix theory to characterize memorization error in high-dimensional regimes.

Result: Nonlinear Attention incurs higher memorization error than linear ridge regression on random inputs, but the gap vanishes or reverses with structured inputs.

Conclusion: Nonlinearity and input structure interact to govern memorization performance, with theoretical insights validated by experiments.

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized machine learning (ML) by enabling
efficient modeling of global dependencies across inputs. Their inherently
parallelizable structures allow for efficient scaling with the exponentially
increasing size of both pretrained data and model parameters. Yet, despite
their central role as the computational backbone of modern large language
models (LLMs), the theoretical understanding of Attentions, especially in the
nonlinear setting, remains limited.
  In this paper, we provide a precise characterization of the \emph{in-context
memorization error} of \emph{nonlinear Attention}, in the high-dimensional
proportional regime where the number of input tokens $n$ and their embedding
dimension $p$ are both large and comparable. Leveraging recent advances in the
theory of large kernel random matrices, we show that nonlinear Attention
typically incurs higher memorization error than linear ridge regression on
random inputs. However, this gap vanishes, and can even be reversed, when the
input exhibits statistical structure, particularly when the Attention weights
align with the input signal direction. Our results reveal how nonlinearity and
input structure interact with each other to govern the memorization performance
of nonlinear Attention. The theoretical insights are supported by numerical
experiments.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-dimensional data are ubiquitous, with examples ranging from natural
images to scientific datasets, and often reside near low-dimensional manifolds.
Leveraging this geometric structure is vital for downstream tasks, including
signal denoising, reconstruction, and generation. However, in practice, the
manifold is typically unknown and only noisy samples are available. A
fundamental approach to uncovering the manifold structure is local averaging,
which is a cornerstone of state-of-the-art provable methods for manifold
fitting and denoising. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no
works that rigorously analyze the accuracy of local averaging in a manifold
setting in high-noise regimes. In this work, we provide theoretical analyses of
a two-round mini-batch local averaging method applied to noisy samples drawn
from a $d$-dimensional manifold $\mathcal M \subset \mathbb{R}^D$, under a
relatively high-noise regime where the noise size is comparable to the reach
$\tau$. We show that with high probability, the averaged point $\hat{\mathbf
q}$ achieves the bound $d(\hat{\mathbf q}, \mathcal M) \leq \sigma
\sqrt{d\left(1+\frac{\kappa\mathrm{diam}(\mathcal {M})}{\log(D)}\right)}$,
where $\sigma, \mathrm{diam(\mathcal M)},\kappa$ denote the standard deviation
of the Gaussian noise, manifold's diameter and a bound on its extrinsic
curvature, respectively. This is the first analysis of local averaging accuracy
over the manifold in the relatively high noise regime where $\sigma \sqrt{D}
\approx \tau$. The proposed method can serve as a preprocessing step for a wide
range of provable methods designed for lower-noise regimes. Additionally, our
framework can provide a theoretical foundation for a broad spectrum of
denoising and dimensionality reduction methods that rely on local averaging
techniques.

*Pengyu Han,Zeyi Liu,Shijin Chen,Dongliang Zou,Xiao He*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper addresses multi-condition fault diagnosis challenges in industrial systems, proposing a two-stage framework to improve performance under varying conditions like speed and load.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fault diagnosis models degrade under varying operating conditions, and existing domain generalization methods may not fully account for condition-specific impacts on fault features.

Method: A two-stage diagnostic framework combines a domain-generalized encoder with a retraining strategy to extract condition-invariant features and avoid overfitting.

Result: Experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset validate the framework's effectiveness in handling variable-speed and variable-load scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed approach enhances fault diagnosis performance under significant operating condition impacts, offering a practical solution for industrial applications.

Abstract: Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and
presents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The
discrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions
degrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied
to others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has
been introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing
multi-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization
approaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault
features. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific
multi-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect
fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the
extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely
studied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact
on fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the
model to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall
generalization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing
end-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically
in variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a
real-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,
aiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant
operating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with
a retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant
fault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the
source domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are
conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Yigit Berkay Uslu,Navid NaderiAlizadeh,Mark Eisen,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper proposes a state-augmented GNN for resource allocation in wireless networks, avoiding dual subgradient drawbacks by treating dual variables as dynamic inputs. It includes dual variable regression for faster inference and improves training via Lagrangian maximization, validated by power control experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in dual subgradient methods for resource allocation in multi-user wireless networks by leveraging GNNs and dynamic dual variables.

Method: Uses a state-augmented GNN to represent network states as graphs, treats dual variables as dynamic inputs, and employs dual variable regression for initialization. Training involves Lagrangian maximization over sampled multipliers.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in transmit power control experiments, with proven convergence and bounds on dual function optimality gaps.

Conclusion: The proposed GNN-based approach outperforms traditional methods, offering efficient resource allocation with theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks,
where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to
constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a
state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource
allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient
methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and
viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals
supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are
learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve
through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies
during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how
near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be
accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN
parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers
sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of
state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit
power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential
probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality
gaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve exoplanet discovery and characterization efficiency by leveraging light curve analysis and machine learning.

Method: Analyze periodic brightness dips in light curves to detect transits, derive planet parameters, and classify stars using machine learning.

Result: Enables quicker identification of exoplanets and estimation of their key physical properties.

Conclusion: Combining light curve analysis with machine learning enhances exoplanet discovery and characterization from large datasets.

Abstract: Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has
completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study
including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover
exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical
characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset
consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will
examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness
due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived
from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to
derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit,
such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period
will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent
timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The
density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as
well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of
the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase
curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some
machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or
likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil
both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing
important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of
searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional deep learning models are energy-intensive and cloud-dependent, while existing BCPNN implementations are unsuitable for embedded systems. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: The authors develop an FPGA accelerator using High-Level Synthesis, supporting online learning and inference with variable/mixed precision.

Result: The accelerator achieves up to 17.5x latency reduction and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, maintaining accuracy on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets.

Conclusion: This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices, bringing brain-like learning closer to real-world deployment.

Abstract: Edge AI applications increasingly require models that can learn and adapt
on-device with minimal energy budget. Traditional deep learning models, while
powerful, are often overparameterized, energy-hungry, and dependent on cloud
connectivity. Brain-Like Neural Networks (BLNNs), such as the Bayesian
Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), propose a neuromorphic
alternative by mimicking cortical architecture and biologically-constrained
learning. They offer sparse architectures with local learning rules and
unsupervised/semi-supervised learning, making them well-suited for low-power
edge intelligence. However, existing BCPNN implementations rely on GPUs or
datacenter FPGAs, limiting their applicability to embedded systems. This work
presents the first embedded FPGA accelerator for BCPNN on a Zynq UltraScale+
SoC using High-Level Synthesis. We implement both online learning and
inference-only kernels with support for variable and mixed precision. Evaluated
on MNIST, Pneumonia, and Breast Cancer datasets, our accelerator achieves up to
17.5x latency and 94% energy savings over ARM baselines, without sacrificing
accuracy. This work enables practical neuromorphic computing on edge devices,
bridging the gap between brain-like learning and real-world deployment.

TL;DR: C-XAI aims to reveal AI's inner representations, but people may not recognize or appreciate generalizations in concepts, especially in safety-critical tasks like railway safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if people can distinguish desirable generalizations from undesirable imprecision in C-XAI concepts for complex tasks like safety evaluation.

Method: An experimental railway safety scenario where participants evaluated AI decisions explained by image snippets (concepts) varying in relevance (track relation vs. actions).

Result: Participants rated generalized concepts (less relevant features) lower than precise matches and similarly to misrepresentations, but were sensitive to imprecisions in relevant features.

Conclusion: People may not spontaneously recognize generalizations in C-XAI, questioning their ability to infer AI's deeper understanding of complex situations.

Abstract: Concept-based explainable artificial intelligence (C-XAI) can help reveal the
inner representations of AI models. Understanding these representations is
particularly important in complex tasks like safety evaluation. Such tasks rely
on high-level semantic information (e.g., about actions) to make decisions
about abstract categories (e.g., whether a situation is dangerous). In this
context, it may desirable for C-XAI concepts to show some variability,
suggesting that the AI is capable of generalising beyond the concrete details
of a situation. However, it is unclear whether people recognise and appreciate
such generalisations and can distinguish them from other, less desirable forms
of imprecision. This was investigated in an experimental railway safety
scenario. Participants evaluated the performance of a simulated AI that
evaluated whether traffic scenes involving people were dangerous. To explain
these decisions, the AI provided concepts in the form of similar image
snippets. These concepts differed in their match with the classified image,
either regarding a highly relevant feature (i.e., relation to tracks) or a less
relevant feature (i.e., actions). Contrary to the hypotheses, concepts that
generalised over less relevant features led to ratings that were lower than for
precisely matching concepts and comparable to concepts that systematically
misrepresented these features. Conversely, participants were highly sensitive
to imprecisions in relevant features. These findings cast doubts on whether
people spontaneously recognise generalisations. Accordingly, they might not be
able to infer from C-XAI concepts whether AI models have gained a deeper
understanding of complex situations.

Motivation: To formalize the concept of machine companionship (MC) and address the lack of systematic engagement with it in literature.

Method: PRISMA-guided scoping review of 71 scholarly works (2017-2025), analyzing theories, dimensions, and measured variables of MC.

Result: Identified wide variation in MC definitions and measurements, culminating in a literature-based definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated, and subjectively positive human-machine connection.

Conclusion: MC is formally defined, providing a foundation for future research and application in human-machine interactions.

Abstract: The notion of machine companions has long been embedded in
social-technological imaginaries. Recent advances in AI have moved those media
musings into believable sociality manifested in interfaces, robotic bodies, and
devices. Those machines are often referred to colloquially as "companions" yet
there is little careful engagement of machine companionship (MC) as a formal
concept or measured variable. This PRISMA-guided scoping review systematically
samples, surveys, and synthesizes current scholarly works on MC (N = 71;
2017-2025), to that end. Works varied widely in considerations of MC according
to guiding theories, dimensions of a-priori specified properties (subjectively
positive, sustained over time, co-active, autotelic), and in measured concepts
(with more than 50 distinct measured variables). WE ultimately offer a
literature-guided definition of MC as an autotelic, coordinated connection
between human and machine that unfolds over time and is subjectively positive.

Motivation: To simplify and enhance vocal harmonization by eliminating the need for manual key specification or musical expertise.

Method: Integrates generative AI for pitch detection and voice modeling with custom-trained symbolic music models to arrange vocal melodies into harmonies.

Result: Produces musically coherent four-part harmonies from any vocal melody, enriching choral textures.

Conclusion: Represents a step toward AI-assisted vocal performance, with potential for real-time applications; implementation is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Vocals harmonizers are powerful tools to help solo vocalists enrich their
melodies with harmonically supportive voices. These tools exist in various
forms, from commercially available pedals and software to custom-built systems,
each employing different methods to generate harmonies. Traditional harmonizers
often require users to manually specify a key or tonal center, while others
allow pitch selection via an external keyboard-both approaches demanding some
degree of musical expertise. The AI Harmonizer introduces a novel approach by
autonomously generating musically coherent four-part harmonies without
requiring prior harmonic input from the user. By integrating state-of-the-art
generative AI techniques for pitch detection and voice modeling with
custom-trained symbolic music models, our system arranges any vocal melody into
rich choral textures. In this paper, we present our methods, explore potential
applications in performance and composition, and discuss future directions for
real-time implementations. While our system currently operates offline, we
believe it represents a significant step toward AI-assisted vocal performance
and expressive musical augmentation. We release our implementation on GitHub.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the musical interface potential of the MindCube, an

Motivation: To address challenges in EEG-based prosthetic control like noise, accuracy, and adaptability, BRAVE integrates EEG and voice for intuitive, muscle-independent control.

Method: Combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models with EEG preprocessing (bandpass filter, ICA, CSP) and ASR for mode switching. Operates in real-time with 150 ms latency.

Result: Achieves 96% classification accuracy and real-time responsiveness, validated on a prosthetic arm and multiple users.

Conclusion: BRAVE demonstrates robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control, suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have the potential to enable
intuitive control of prosthetic limbs for individuals with upper limb
amputations. However, existing EEG-based control systems face challenges
related to signal noise, classification accuracy, and real-time adaptability.
In this work, we present BRAVE, a hybrid EEG and voice-controlled prosthetic
system that integrates ensemble learning-based EEG classification with a
human-in-the-loop (HITL) correction framework for enhanced responsiveness.
Unlike traditional electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic control, BRAVE aims
to interpret EEG-driven motor intent, enabling movement control without
reliance on residual muscle activity. To improve classification robustness,
BRAVE combines LSTM, CNN, and Random Forest models in an ensemble framework,
achieving a classification accuracy of 96% across test subjects. EEG signals
are preprocessed using a bandpass filter (0.5-45 Hz), Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) for artifact removal, and Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) feature
extraction to minimize contamination from electromyographic (EMG) and
electrooculographic (EOG) signals. Additionally, BRAVE incorporates automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to facilitate intuitive mode switching between
different degrees of freedom (DOF) in the prosthetic arm. The system operates
in real time, with a response latency of 150 ms, leveraging Lab Streaming Layer
(LSL) networking for synchronized data acquisition. The system is evaluated on
an in-house fabricated prosthetic arm and on multiple participants highlighting
the generalizability across users. The system is optimized for low-power
embedded deployment, ensuring practical real-world application beyond
high-performance computing environments. Our results indicate that BRAVE offers
a promising step towards robust, real-time, non-invasive prosthetic control.

TL;DR: Pix2Geomodel, a cGAN framework, predicts reservoir properties with high accuracy for facies and water saturation, moderate for porosity and permeability, and shows robust translation performance, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geological modeling struggles with complex subsurface heterogeneity and data conditioning, necessitating a more accurate method.

Method: The study uses a cGAN framework (Pix2Pix-based) with U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator, trained on a 7.6 million-cell dataset, including preprocessing, augmentation, and 19,000 training steps.

Result: High accuracy for facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), moderate for porosity and permeability, and strong translation performance.

Conclusion: Pix2Geomodel improves reservoir property prediction, though limitations like 2D constraints exist, suggesting future 3D modeling and multi-modal data integration.

Abstract: Accurate geological modeling is critical for reservoir characterization, yet
traditional methods struggle with complex subsurface heterogeneity, and they
have problems with conditioning to observed data. This study introduces
Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)
framework based on Pix2Pix, designed to predict reservoir properties (facies,
porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of
the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the
Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology
included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per
property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over
19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection
over union (mIoU), frequency weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), and
visualizations assessed performance in masked property prediction and
property-to-property translation tasks. Results demonstrated high accuracy for
facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with
moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74,
FWIoU 0.60), and robust translation performance (e.g., facies-to-facies PA
0.98, FWIoU 0.97). The framework captured spatial variability and geological
realism, as validated by variogram analysis, and calculated the training loss
curves for the generator and discriminator for each property. Compared to
traditional methods, Pix2Geomodel offers enhanced fidelity in direct property
mapping. Limitations include challenges with microstructural variability and 2D
constraints, suggesting future integration of multi-modal data and 3D modeling
(Pix2Geomodel v2.0). This study advances the application of generative AI in
geoscience, supporting improved reservoir management and open science
initiatives.

### [504] [PaceLLM: Brain-Inspired Large Language Models for Long-Context Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17310)
*Kangcong Li,Peng Ye,Chongjun Tu,Lin Zhang,Chunfeng Song,Jiamin Wu,Tao Yang,Qihao Zheng,Tao Chen*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: PaceLLM improves LLMs' long-context capabilities with brain-inspired innovations: Persistent Activity Mechanism and Cortical Expert Clustering, achieving significant performance gains and extended context length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of LLMs in long-context tasks due to information decay and semantic fragmentation by mimicking brain mechanisms like working memory and cortical modularity.

Method: Introduces two innovations: (1) Persistent Activity Mechanism for dynamic retrieval and reuse of critical FFN states, and (2) Cortical Expert Clustering to reorganize FFN weights into semantic modules.

Result: Achieves 6% improvement on Multi-document QA, 12.5-17.5% gains on Infinite-Bench tasks, and extends context length to 200K tokens in NIAH tests.

Conclusion: PaceLLM pioneers brain-inspired LLM optimization, enhancing long-context performance and interpretability without structural changes, and is generalizable to other models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance across
domains, their long-context capabilities are limited by transient neural
activations causing information decay and unstructured feed-forward network
(FFN) weights leading to semantic fragmentation. Inspired by the brain's
working memory and cortical modularity, we propose PaceLLM, featuring two
innovations: (1) a Persistent Activity (PA) Mechanism that mimics prefrontal
cortex (PFC) neurons' persistent firing by introducing an activation-level
memory bank to dynamically retrieve, reuse, and update critical FFN states,
addressing contextual decay; and (2) Cortical Expert (CE) Clustering that
emulates task-adaptive neural specialization to reorganize FFN weights into
semantic modules, establishing cross-token dependencies and mitigating
fragmentation. Extensive evaluations show that PaceLLM achieves 6% improvement
on LongBench's Multi-document QA and 12.5-17.5% performance gains on
Infinite-Bench tasks, while extending measurable context length to 200K tokens
in Needle-In-A-Haystack (NIAH) tests. This work pioneers brain-inspired LLM
optimization and is complementary to other works. Besides, it can be
generalized to any model and enhance their long-context performance and
interpretability without structural overhauls.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: The paper explores the convergence between neural machine translation models and human memory models, showing how RNN-based architectures align with the CMR model. It proposes a new cognitive model for human memory search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why humans develop context-based memory architectures and to leverage neural machine translation models for insights into human memory.

Method: Compare RNN-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention to the CMR model, then implement a neural machine translation model as a cognitive model.

Result: The model matches human behavioral patterns as effectively as context-based memory models and reveals insights into memory search dynamics.

Conclusion: The convergence of neural machine translation and human memory models offers functional insights into context's role and provides a new, interpretable cognitive model.

Abstract: Past work has long recognized the important role of context in guiding how
humans search their memory. While context-based memory models can explain many
memory phenomena, it remains unclear why humans develop such architectures over
possible alternatives in the first place. In this work, we demonstrate that
foundational architectures in neural machine translation -- specifically,
recurrent neural network (RNN)-based sequence-to-sequence models with attention
-- exhibit mechanisms that directly correspond to those specified in the
Context Maintenance and Retrieval (CMR) model of human memory. Since neural
machine translation models have evolved to optimize task performance, their
convergence with human memory models provides a deeper understanding of the
functional role of context in human memory, as well as presenting new ways to
model human memory. Leveraging this convergence, we implement a neural machine
translation model as a cognitive model of human memory search that is both
interpretable and capable of capturing complex dynamics of learning. We show
that our model accounts for both averaged and optimal human behavioral patterns
as effectively as context-based memory models. Further, we demonstrate
additional strengths of the proposed model by evaluating how memory search
performance emerges from the interaction of different model components.

*Jennifer Wang,Andrew Selbst,Solon Barocas,Suresh Venkatasubramanian*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper discusses how existing AI regulations, designed for predictive AI, may not suit generative AI due to its unique challenges. It identifies four key differences and suggests new policy approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI exposes gaps in current regulatory frameworks, necessitating tailored policies to address its distinct risks and characteristics.

Method: The authors analyze four unique aspects of generative AI that challenge existing regulations and propose three recommendations for policymakers.

Result: Generative AI's adaptability, evaluation challenges, legal concerns, and distributed value chain require new regulatory strategies.

Conclusion: Policymakers must reassess and adapt regulations to effectively govern generative AI, leveraging ecosystem constraints and targeted policies.

Abstract: Over the past decade, policymakers have developed a set of regulatory tools
to ensure AI development aligns with key societal goals. Many of these tools
were initially developed in response to concerns with predictive AI and
therefore encode certain assumptions about the nature of AI systems and the
utility of certain regulatory approaches. With the advent of generative AI,
however, some of these assumptions no longer hold, even as policymakers attempt
to maintain a single regulatory target that covers both types of AI.
  In this paper, we identify four distinct aspects of generative AI that call
for meaningfully different policy responses. These are the generality and
adaptability of generative AI that make it a poor regulatory target, the
difficulty of designing effective evaluations, new legal concerns that change
the ecosystem of stakeholders and sources of expertise, and the distributed
structure of the generative AI value chain.
  In light of these distinctions, policymakers will need to evaluate where the
past decade of policy work remains relevant and where new policies, designed to
address the unique risks posed by generative AI, are necessary. We outline
three recommendations for policymakers to more effectively identify regulatory
targets and leverage constraints across the broader ecosystem to govern
generative AI.

### [508] [The Democratic Paradox in Large Language Models' Underestimation of Press Freedom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18045)
*I. Loaiza,R. Vestrelli,A. Fronzetti Colladon,R. Rigobon*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs systematically underestimate press freedom globally, with biases like negative misalignment, differential misalignment, and home bias, raising concerns about their role in shaping public trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how LLMs evaluate press freedom compared to expert benchmarks, highlighting potential biases affecting public understanding of democratic institutions.

Method: Analyzed six popular LLMs' evaluations of press freedom in 180 countries against the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI).

Result: LLMs consistently underestimated press freedom (71%-93% of countries rated less free), showed differential misalignment (worse in freer countries), and exhibited home bias (favoring their home countries).

Conclusion: LLMs must improve accuracy in representing global civic rights to avoid distorting public trust and understanding.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly mediate global information
access for millions of users worldwide, their alignment and biases have the
potential to shape public understanding and trust in fundamental democratic
institutions, such as press freedom. In this study, we uncover three systematic
distortions in the way six popular LLMs evaluate press freedom in 180 countries
compared to expert assessments of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The six
LLMs exhibit a negative misalignment, consistently underestimating press
freedom, with individual models rating between 71% to 93% of countries as less
free. We also identify a paradoxical pattern we term differential misalignment:
LLMs disproportionately underestimate press freedom in countries where it is
strongest. Additionally, five of the six LLMs exhibit positive home bias,
rating their home countries' press freedoms more favorably than would be
expected given their negative misalignment with the human benchmark. In some
cases, LLMs rate their home countries between 7% to 260% more positively than
expected. If LLMs are set to become the next search engines and some of the
most important cultural tools of our time, they must ensure accurate
representations of the state of our human and civic rights globally.

TL;DR: The paper explores using GPT-4o with Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automatically generate interactive tutor training lessons for middle school math, finding task decomposition improves lesson quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the creation of effective, structured training lessons for novice online math tutors, reducing manual effort.

Method: Used prompt engineering with GPT-4o and task decomposition to generate lessons for three topics, evaluated by human assessors.

Result: Task decomposition yielded higher-rated lessons, with strengths in structure and efficiency but weaknesses in feedback and clarity.

Conclusion: Hybrid human-AI approaches show promise for scalable, effective tutor training lesson generation.

Abstract: We explore the automatic generation of interactive, scenario-based lessons
designed to train novice human tutors who teach middle school mathematics
online. Employing prompt engineering through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
approach with GPT-4o, we developed a system capable of creating structured
tutor training lessons. Our study generated lessons in English for three key
topics: Encouraging Students' Independence, Encouraging Help-Seeking Behavior,
and Turning on Cameras, using a task decomposition prompting strategy that
breaks lesson generation into sub-tasks. The generated lessons were evaluated
by two human evaluators, who provided both quantitative and qualitative
evaluations using a comprehensive rubric informed by lesson design research.
Results demonstrate that the task decomposition strategy led to higher-rated
lessons compared to single-step generation. Human evaluators identified several
strengths in the LLM-generated lessons, including well-structured content and
time-saving potential, while also noting limitations such as generic feedback
and a lack of clarity in some instructional sections. These findings underscore
the potential of hybrid human-AI approaches for generating effective lessons in
tutor training.

TL;DR: The study evaluates the effectiveness of an LLM-based Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA) in a real-world AI programming course, analyzing student perceptions, interactions, and comparing them to human instructor interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of empirical studies on the practical impact of VTAs in classrooms and assess their feasibility for broader adoption.

Method: Developed an LLM-based VTA, deployed it in a course with 477 students, conducted three rounds of surveys, and analyzed 3,869 student-VTA interactions.

Result: The study provides insights into student perceptions, engagement patterns, and the VTA's role compared to human instructors, identifying key challenges for adoption.

Conclusion: VTAs show potential in enhancing learning, but broader adoption requires addressing identified challenges; the study also releases the VTA system's source code for future advancements.

Abstract: Virtual Teaching Assistants (VTAs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)
have the potential to enhance student learning by providing instant feedback
and facilitating multi-turn interactions. However, empirical studies on their
effectiveness and acceptance in real-world classrooms are limited, leaving
their practical impact uncertain. In this study, we develop an LLM-based VTA
and deploy it in an introductory AI programming course with 477 graduate
students. To assess how student perceptions of the VTA's performance evolve
over time, we conduct three rounds of comprehensive surveys at different stages
of the course. Additionally, we analyze 3,869 student--VTA interaction pairs to
identify common question types and engagement patterns. We then compare these
interactions with traditional student--human instructor interactions to
evaluate the VTA's role in the learning process. Through a large-scale
empirical study and interaction analysis, we assess the feasibility of
deploying VTAs in real-world classrooms and identify key challenges for broader
adoption. Finally, we release the source code of our VTA system, fostering
future advancements in AI-driven education:

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal biometrics to detect smartphone distractions in online learning, achieving 91% accuracy with combined signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in maintaining learner engagement due to distractions like smartphone use, leveraging MMLA and biosensors for deeper insights.

Method: An AI-based approach using physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use, comparing single and multimodal biometric signals.

Result: Single signals (e.g., brain waves, heart rate) are less accurate (87% for head pose alone), while a multimodal model achieves 91% accuracy.

Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of multimodal biometrics for real-time support in online learning, though deployment challenges remain.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of multimodal biometrics to detect
distractions caused by smartphone use during tasks that require sustained
attention, with a focus on computer-based online learning. Although the methods
are applicable to various domains, such as autonomous driving, we concentrate
on the challenges learners face in maintaining engagement amid internal (e.g.,
motivation), system-related (e.g., course design) and contextual (e.g.,
smartphone use) factors. Traditional learning platforms often lack detailed
behavioral data, but Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) and biosensors
provide new insights into learner attention. We propose an AI-based approach
that leverages physiological signals and head pose data to detect phone use.
Our results show that single biometric signals, such as brain waves or heart
rate, offer limited accuracy, while head pose alone achieves 87%. A multimodal
model combining all signals reaches 91% accuracy, highlighting the benefits of
integration. We conclude by discussing the implications and limitations of
deploying these models for real-time support in online learning environments.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores ethical challenges in AI-driven e-commerce, focusing on bias, privacy, and autonomy, and proposes best practices for fairness and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address ethical concerns like bias and privacy in AI-driven e-commerce systems, ensuring they are fair and transparent.

Method: Examines ethical implications and proposes actionable best practices, including algorithm audits, diverse training data, and fairness metrics.

Result: Identifies ethical challenges and suggests frameworks for ethical conformance, emphasizing fairness, transparency, and privacy.

Conclusion: Provides guidelines for responsible AI use in e-commerce, ensuring effectiveness and ethical soundness.

Abstract: As e-commerce rapidly integrates artificial intelligence for content creation
and product recommendations, these technologies offer significant benefits in
personalization and efficiency. AI-driven systems automate product
descriptions, generate dynamic advertisements, and deliver tailored
recommendations based on consumer behavior, as seen in major platforms like
Amazon and Shopify. However, the widespread use of AI in e-commerce raises
crucial ethical challenges, particularly around data privacy, algorithmic bias,
and consumer autonomy. Bias -- whether cultural, gender-based, or socioeconomic
-- can be inadvertently embedded in AI models, leading to inequitable product
recommendations and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. This paper examines the
ethical implications of AI-driven content creation and product recommendations,
emphasizing the need for frameworks to ensure fairness, transparency, and need
for more established and robust ethical standards. We propose actionable best
practices to remove bias and ensure inclusivity, such as conducting regular
audits of algorithms, diversifying training data, and incorporating fairness
metrics into AI models. Additionally, we discuss frameworks for ethical
conformance that focus on safeguarding consumer data privacy, promoting
transparency in decision-making processes, and enhancing consumer autonomy. By
addressing these issues, we provide guidelines for responsibly utilizing AI in
e-commerce applications for content creation and product recommendations,
ensuring that these technologies are both effective and ethically sound.

*Cedric Bernard,Xavier Pleimling,Amun Kharel,Chase Vickery*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: A model detects and reduces bias in political articles by analyzing both text and images, using CLIP, ViT, and BERT models, showing promising initial results but needing further refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Political echo chambers amplify bias in articles, but prior work ignored images. Addressing both text and image bias is crucial for balanced communication.

Method: The model involves four steps: Image Text Alignment (CLIP), Image Bias Scoring (ViT), Text De-Biasing (BERT), and final debiasing by replacing biased content with neutral versions.

Result: Text debiasing identifies biased words effectively; ViT trains well, and semantic alignment is efficient. More training and resources are needed for better results.

Conclusion: The approach is promising but requires further development and human evaluation to ensure semantic consistency in debiased content.

Abstract: Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to
detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both
the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on
solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image
portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium
to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that
leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps.
Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their
bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias
score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting
biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three
steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and
the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by
comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is
promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many
potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective
training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time,
particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A
human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of
the newly generated text and images.

*Meng Xia,Robin Schmucker,Conrad Borchers,Vincent Aleven*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Fast-Forwarding reduces overpractice in tutoring systems by skipping mastered steps, improving efficiency without curriculum redesign.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overpractice of mastered skills in tutoring systems wastes time and resources, necessitating adaptive solutions like Fast-Forwarding.

Method: Proposes Fast-Forwarding, a step-level adaptive technique, evaluated via simulations using learner models and real student data.

Result: Reduces overpractice by up to one-third, especially effective with algorithms favoring difficult problems.

Conclusion: Fast-Forwarding enhances practice efficiency but depends on student motivation for higher difficulty levels.

Abstract: Mastery learning improves learning proficiency and efficiency. However, the
overpractice of skills--students spending time on skills they have already
mastered--remains a fundamental challenge for tutoring systems. Previous
research has reduced overpractice through the development of better problem
selection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few
efforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level
adaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose
and evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem
selection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models
and problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding
can reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to
complete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered.
Fast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection
algorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that
preferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that
while Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its
practical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and
engaged at higher levels of difficulty.

TL;DR: The study uses machine learning to link biased insurance risk methods with air pollution disparities in Baltimore, revealing ongoing discrimination affecting minority communities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how historical biased policies, like insurance risk estimation, correlate with current air pollution disparities in Baltimore.

Method: Applied machine learning to analyze data from insurance risk methods, demographics, and pollution levels (NO2 and PM2.5) across 650,643 residents.

Result: Found clear associations between biased insurance methods and higher pollution levels in low-income and minority neighborhoods.

Conclusion: Decades-old discriminatory policies continue to impact air quality and quality of life for Baltimore's minority populations.

Abstract: In this study, we apply machine learning and software engineering in
analyzing air pollution levels in City of Baltimore. The data model was fed
with three primary data sources: 1) a biased method of estimating insurance
risk used by homeowners loan corporation, 2) demographics of Baltimore
residents, and 3) census data estimate of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The
dataset covers 650,643 Baltimore residents in 44.7 million residents in 202
major cities in US. The results show that air pollution levels have a clear
association with the biased insurance estimating method. Great disparities
present in NO2 level between more desirable and low income blocks. Similar
disparities exist in air pollution level between residents' ethnicity. As
Baltimore population consists of a greater proportion of people of color, the
finding reveals how decades old policies has continued to discriminate and
affect quality of life of Baltimore citizens today.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: MAARTA is a multi-agent framework designed to help radiology students improve perceptual expertise by analyzing gaze patterns and reports, providing personalized feedback to address errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems lack the ability to explain perceptual errors in radiology training, leading to gaps in student learning.

Method: MAARTA uses a multi-agent approach to dynamically analyze gaze behavior and reports, comparing expert and student patterns to identify errors and provide adaptive feedback.

Result: The system identifies missed findings and uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand and correct errors.

Conclusion: MAARTA advances AI-driven radiology education by addressing perceptual errors and improving diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: Radiology students often struggle to develop perceptual expertise due to
limited expert mentorship time, leading to errors in visual search and
diagnostic interpretation. These perceptual errors, such as missed fixations,
short dwell times, or misinterpretations, are not adequately addressed by
current AI systems, which focus on diagnostic accuracy but fail to explain how
and why errors occur. To address this gap, we introduce MAARTA (Multi-Agentic
Adaptive Radiology Teaching Assistant), a multi-agent framework that analyzes
gaze patterns and radiology reports to provide personalized feedback. Unlike
single-agent models, MAARTA dynamically selects agents based on error
complexity, enabling adaptive and efficient reasoning. By comparing expert and
student gaze behavior through structured graphs, the system identifies missed
findings and assigns Perceptual Error Teacher agents to analyze discrepancies.
MAARTA then uses step-by-step prompting to help students understand their
errors and improve diagnostic reasoning, advancing AI-driven radiology
education.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HTHGN, a novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network, to model high-order interactions in complex heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs), addressing limitations of existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRL methods focus on low-order topology and static homogeneous graphs, ignoring higher-order group interactions in real-world networks.

Method: Proposes a formal definition of heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and a $P$-uniform hyperedge construction algorithm, followed by HTHGN with hierarchical attention and contrastive learning.

Result: HTHGN effectively captures high-order interactions in HTGs, verified by experiments on three real-world datasets with significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: HTHGN successfully models high-order interactions in HTGs, outperforming existing methods and addressing their limitations.

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) has emerged as an effective technique for
modeling graph-structured data. When modeling heterogeneity and dynamics in
real-world complex networks, GRL methods designed for complex heterogeneous
temporal graphs (HTGs) have been proposed and have achieved successful
applications in various fields. However, most existing GRL methods mainly focus
on preserving the low-order topology information while ignoring higher-order
group interaction relationships, which are more consistent with real-world
networks. In addition, most existing hypergraph methods can only model static
homogeneous graphs, limiting their ability to model high-order interactions in
HTGs. Therefore, to simultaneously enable the GRL model to capture high-order
interaction relationships in HTGs, we first propose a formal definition of
heterogeneous temporal hypergraphs and $P$-uniform heterogeneous hyperedge
construction algorithm that does not rely on additional information. Then, a
novel Heterogeneous Temporal HyperGraph Neural network (HTHGN), is proposed to
fully capture higher-order interactions in HTGs. HTHGN contains a hierarchical
attention mechanism module that simultaneously performs temporal
message-passing between heterogeneous nodes and hyperedges to capture rich
semantics in a wider receptive field brought by hyperedges. Furthermore, HTHGN
performs contrastive learning by maximizing the consistency between low-order
correlated heterogeneous node pairs on HTG to avoid the low-order structural
ambiguity issue. Detailed experimental results on three real-world HTG datasets
verify the effectiveness of the proposed HTHGN for modeling high-order
interactions in HTGs and demonstrate significant performance improvements.

Motivation: To address the limitations of existing graph metrics by providing more general penalties for edge mismatches and enabling distance measurement between graphs of varying sizes.

Method: Proposes a generalized form of the GOSPA metric, proves its metric properties, and demonstrates its computation via linear programming. Simulation and real-world experiments validate its utility.

Result: The proposed metric family effectively penalizes node and edge mismatches, with practical benefits shown in classification tasks on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The graph GOSPA metric family offers a flexible and effective tool for graph distance measurement, with demonstrated advantages in both theoretical and practical scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between
graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of
the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also
proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric,
the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs
for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes.
However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for
edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the
graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear
programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the
characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different
choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric
family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.

*Moein Khajehnejad,Forough Habibollahi,Adeel Razi*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: BrainSymphony is a lightweight, efficient foundation model for neuroimaging that outperforms larger models using multimodal architecture and smaller datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of large, data-intensive foundation models in neuroimaging by developing a more efficient alternative.

Method: Uses parallel spatial and temporal transformer streams for fMRI, a signed graph transformer for diffusion MRI, and integrates modalities with an adaptive fusion gate.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks and reveals novel brain dynamics insights.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can surpass larger counterparts, enabling more accessible computational neuroscience research.

Abstract: Existing foundation models for neuroimaging are often prohibitively large and
data-intensive. We introduce BrainSymphony, a lightweight, parameter-efficient
foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance while being
pre-trained on significantly smaller public datasets. BrainSymphony's strong
multimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial
and temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a
unified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models
structural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph
transformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful,
modality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion
gate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger
models on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification,
prediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our
model revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a
unique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration).
BrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can
surpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and
powerful research in computational neuroscience.

TL;DR: LMR-BENCH is a benchmark to evaluate LLM agents' ability to reproduce code from NLP research papers, revealing persistent limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap in understanding LLM agents' capability to reproduce code from research papers, especially in NLP, motivates the creation of LMR-BENCH.

Method: The benchmark includes 28 tasks from 23 NLP papers, providing models with research papers, masked code repositories, and implementation instructions. Experiments use standard prompting and LLM agent settings.

Result: Advanced LLMs show limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis, failing to autonomously reproduce research accurately.

Conclusion: LMR-BENCH highlights critical gaps in LLM agents' ability to reproduce scientific research, emphasizing the need for further development in this area.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in
advancing scientific discovery. However, their capability in the fundamental
yet crucial task of reproducing code from research papers, especially in the
NLP domain, remains underexplored. This task includes unique complex reasoning
challenges in the intellectual synthesis of abstract concepts and the
comprehension of code repositories with interdependent files. Motivated by this
gap, we present LMR-BENCH, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the
capability of LLM agents on code reproduction from Language Modeling Research.
It consists of 28 code reproduction tasks derived from 23 research papers
published in top-tier NLP venues over the past five years, spanning nine
fundamental categories. Models are provided with a research paper, a code
repository containing one or more masked functions, and instructions for
implementing these functions. We conduct extensive experiments in standard
prompting and LLM agent settings with state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the
accuracy of unit tests and performing LLM-based evaluation of code correctness.
Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced models still exhibit
persistent limitations in scientific reasoning and code synthesis, highlighting
critical gaps in LLM agents' ability to autonomously reproduce scientific
research

### [521] [Re-Evaluating Code LLM Benchmarks Under Semantic Mutation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17369)
*Zhiyuan Pan,Xing Hu,Xin Xia,Xiaohu Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper investigates prompt sensitivity in code benchmarks for LLMs, revealing that minor prompt variations can significantly impact performance and model rankings, advocating for more robust benchmark designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code benchmarks rely on single prompt templates, making them prone to prompt sensitivity, which undermines reliable evaluation of LLM capabilities.

Method: A general framework for modifying prompt templates while preserving semantics and structure is proposed, followed by experiments on eight tasks with 100 prompt variations each, tested on 10 LLMs.

Result: Slight prompt variations cause significant performance shifts and inconsistencies in model rankings, highlighting prompt sensitivity as a critical issue.

Conclusion: Future code benchmarks must account for prompt sensitivity to ensure reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM capabilities.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), code benchmarks have become an
important research area in software engineering and are widely used by
practitioners. These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific
code-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step
in constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing
code benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are
prone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could
result in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations
of model capabilities.
  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental
designs and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt
sensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that
modifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and
their structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct
extensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative
open-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt
templates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical
metrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings
suggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in
performance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce
inconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These
insights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing
future code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM
capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the shift to AI-assisted generative software reuse, comparing it to cargo cult development, and proposes a research agenda for addressing its challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of AI in software development is replacing traditional reuse practices, raising concerns about trust and effectiveness, akin to cargo cult development.

Method: The paper analyzes the implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse and defines a research agenda for emerging "AI native" software engineering.

Result: Highlights the need for addressing central issues in AI-assisted software reuse and calls for action in this evolving paradigm.

Conclusion: A research agenda is proposed to tackle challenges in AI-native software engineering, emphasizing the need for further investigation.

Abstract: Software development is currently under a paradigm shift in which artificial
intelligence and generative software reuse are taking the center stage in
software creation. Consequently, earlier software reuse practices and methods
are rapidly being replaced by AI-assisted approaches in which developers place
their trust on code that has been generated by artificial intelligence. This is
leading to a new form of software reuse that is conceptually not all that
different from cargo cult development. In this paper we discuss the
implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse in the context of
emerging "AI native" software engineering, bring forth relevant questions, and
define a tentative research agenda and call to action for tackling some of the
central issues associated with this approach.

### [523] [Call Me Maybe: Enhancing JavaScript Call Graph Construction using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18191)
*Masudul Hasan Masud Bhuiyan,Gianluca De Stefano,Giancarlo Pellegrino,Cristian-Alexandru Staicu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: GRAPHIA uses graph neural networks to improve JavaScript call graph construction by predicting missed edges, achieving top-1 accuracy of 42% and top-5 accuracy of 72%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing JavaScript call graph tools are neither sound nor complete, missing valid edges and producing false ones. GRAPHIA aims to address this by identifying missed call edges.

Method: GRAPHIA frames the problem as link prediction on full program graphs, using a rich representation with syntactic and semantic edges. It leverages graph neural networks and learns from imperfect labels (static/dynamic edges).

Result: GRAPHIA achieves 42% top-1 and 72% top-5 accuracy in ranking correct target functions for unresolved call sites, reducing manual analysis effort.

Conclusion: Learning-based methods like GRAPHIA can enhance JavaScript call graph recall, marking the first application of GNN-based link prediction to full program graphs for interprocedural analysis.

Abstract: Static analysis plays a key role in finding bugs, including security issues.
A critical step in static analysis is building accurate call graphs that model
function calls in a program. However, due to hard-to-analyze language features,
existing call graph construction algorithms for JavaScript are neither sound
nor complete. Prior work shows that even advanced solutions produce false edges
and miss valid ones. In this work, we assist these tools by identifying missed
call edges. Our main idea is to frame the problem as link prediction on full
program graphs, using a rich representation with multiple edge types. Our
approach, GRAPHIA, leverages recent advances in graph neural networks to model
non-local relationships between code elements. Concretely, we propose
representing JavaScript programs using a combination of syntactic- and
semantic-based edges. GRAPHIA can learn from imperfect labels, including static
call edges from existing tools and dynamic edges from tests, either from the
same or different projects. Because call graphs are sparse, standard machine
learning metrics like ROC are not suitable. Instead, we evaluate GRAPHIA by
ranking function definitions for each unresolved call site. We conduct a
large-scale evaluation on 50 popular JavaScript libraries with 163K call edges
(150K static and 13K dynamic). GRAPHIA builds program graphs with 6.6M
structural and 386K semantic edges. It ranks the correct target as the top
candidate in over 42% of unresolved cases and within the top 5 in 72% of cases,
reducing the manual effort needed for analysis. Our results show that
learning-based methods can improve the recall of JavaScript call graph
construction. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply GNN-based link
prediction to full multi-file program graphs for interprocedural analysis.

*Saurabhsingh Rajput,Mootez Saad,Tushar Sharma*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Strategic selection across AI pipeline phases reduces energy use by 94.6% while maintaining 95.95% F1 score, promoting sustainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing AI's growing computational and energy demands by making energy efficiency a primary design focus, not an afterthought.

Method: Analyzes combinatorial effects of optimizations (knobs) across five AI pipeline phases: data, model, training, system, and inference.

Result: Orthogonal combinations of optimizations achieve up to 94.6% energy reduction with minimal performance loss (95.95% F1 score retained).

Conclusion: A curated, strategic approach to AI pipeline design balances efficiency, performance, and environmental sustainability.

Abstract: AI's exponential growth intensifies computational demands and energy
challenges. While practitioners employ various optimization techniques, that we
refer as "knobs" in this paper, to tune model efficiency, these are typically
afterthoughts and reactive ad-hoc changes applied in isolation without
understanding their combinatorial effects on energy efficiency. This paper
emphasizes on treating energy efficiency as the first-class citizen and as a
fundamental design consideration for a compute-intensive pipeline. We show that
strategic selection across five AI pipeline phases (data, model, training,
system, inference) creates cascading efficiency. Experimental validation shows
orthogonal combinations reduce energy consumption by up to $94.6$% while
preserving $95.95$% of the original F1 score of non-optimized pipelines. This
curated approach provides actionable frameworks for informed sustainable AI
that balance efficiency, performance, and environmental responsibility.

*Lehan He,Zeren Chen,Zhe Zhang,Jing Shao,Xiang Gao,Lu Sheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Property-Generated Solver uses Property-Based Testing (PBT) to improve LLM code generation by validating high-level properties instead of specific test cases, achieving significant performance gains over TDD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring functional correctness in LLM-generated code is challenging due to flawed or scarce test cases in traditional TDD.

Method: Introduces a framework with two LLM agents: a Generator for code refinement and a Tester for PBT lifecycle and feedback.

Result: Achieves 23.1% to 37.3% relative pass@1 improvements over TDD methods in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Property-Generated Solver enhances LLM code correctness and generalizability through PBT-based validation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their
outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is
a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers
a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the
scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test
generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can
misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated
Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to
validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on
specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define
and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the
"cycle of self-deception" where tests might share flaws with the code they are
meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative
LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative
refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate
semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting
comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its
refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within
this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a
robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code.
Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks
demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1
improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD
methods.

TL;DR: AI debugging effectiveness decays exponentially, losing 60-80% capability in 2-3 attempts. The Debugging Decay Index (DDI) quantifies this and predicts intervention points. A fresh start strategy improves debugging by shifting from exploitation to exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative debugging is crucial for AI code generation, but current models lose effectiveness quickly. Understanding and mitigating this decay is essential for practical systems.

Method: Introduces DDI, a framework to quantify debugging decay and predict intervention points. Proposes a strategic fresh start approach to shift debugging strategy.

Result: DDI identifies when debugging becomes ineffective. Timely interventions can rescue debugging effectiveness, improving iterative code generation.

Conclusion: DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in AI debugging and offers a quantitative framework to optimize debugging strategies.

Abstract: The effectiveness of AI debugging follows a predictable exponential decay
pattern; most models lose 60-80% of their debugging capability within just 2-3
attempts, despite iterative debugging being a critical capability for practical
code generation systems. We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a
mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and
predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from
exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process,
demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of
debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and
provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code
generation strategies.

Motivation: To understand the internal dynamics and failure modes of LLM-based agents in automating complex tasks like program repair and issue resolution.

Method: A large-scale empirical study of three LLM-based agents, analyzing 120 trajectories and 2822 interactions, combining quantitative and qualitative assessments.

Result: Identified key trajectory characteristics, behavioral motifs, and anti-patterns, offering insights for improving agent design.

Conclusion: The study provides actionable insights for enhancing LLM-based agents and releases a dataset for further research.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly employed to automate
complex software engineering tasks such as program repair and issue resolution.
These agents operate by autonomously generating natural language thoughts,
invoking external tools, and iteratively refining their solutions. Despite
their widespread adoption, the internal decision-making processes of these
agents remain largely unexplored, limiting our understanding of their
operational dynamics and failure modes. In this paper, we present a large-scale
empirical study of the thought-action-result trajectories of three
state-of-the-art LLM-based agents: \textsc{RepairAgent},
\textsc{AutoCodeRover}, and \textsc{OpenHands}. We unify their interaction logs
into a common format, capturing 120 trajectories and 2822 LLM interactions
focused on program repair and issue resolution. Our study combines quantitative
analyses of structural properties, action patterns, and token usage with
qualitative assessments of reasoning coherence and feedback integration. We
identify key trajectory characteristics such as iteration counts and token
consumption, recurring action sequences, and the semantic coherence linking
thoughts, actions, and their results. Our findings reveal behavioral motifs and
anti-patterns that distinguish successful from failed executions, providing
actionable insights for improving agent design, including prompting strategies,
failure diagnosis, and anti-pattern detection. We release our dataset and
annotation framework to support further research on transparent and robust
autonomous software engineering agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coastal datasets are too coarse (1-4 km resolution), limiting their utility. High-precision data is needed.

Method: Uses publicly available satellite imagery and computer vision to create a 10m-resolution dataset. Introduces Lighthouse, a fast and resource-efficient algorithm.

Result: 100+ fold improvement in precision. Lighthouse achieves millisecond inference with minimal resources (1 CPU, 2GB RAM).

Conclusion: The new dataset and Lighthouse enable high-precision, real-time coastal distance calculations in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We introduce a new dataset and algorithm for fast and efficient coastal
distance calculations from Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Existing global coastal
datasets are only available at coarse resolution (e.g. 1-4 km) which limits
their utility. Publicly available satellite imagery combined with computer
vision enable much higher precision. We provide a global coastline dataset at
10 meter resolution, a 100+ fold improvement in precision over existing data.
To handle the computational challenge of querying at such an increased scale,
we introduce a new library: Layered Iterative Geospatial Hierarchical
Terrain-Oriented Unified Search Engine (Lighthouse). Lighthouse is both
exceptionally fast and resource-efficient, requiring only 1 CPU and 2 GB of RAM
to achieve millisecond online inference, making it well suited for real-time
applications in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: To address underexplored foundational design choices in domain-specific RAG systems, particularly in chemistry, where effective document segmentation and representation are crucial.

Method: The study systematically evaluates 25 chunking configurations and 48 embedding models using three chemistry-specific benchmarks, including the new QuestChemRetrieval dataset.

Result: Recursive token-based chunking (R100-0) and retrieval-optimized embeddings (e.g., Nomic, Intfloat E5) outperform other methods, offering efficiency and strong performance.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable guidelines for building efficient and effective chemistry-aware RAG systems, supported by released datasets and benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital for
navigating the ever-expanding body of scientific literature, particularly in
high-stakes domains such as chemistry. Despite the promise of RAG, foundational
design choices -- such as how documents are segmented and represented -- remain
underexplored in domain-specific contexts. This study presents the first
large-scale, systematic evaluation of chunking strategies and embedding models
tailored to chemistry-focused RAG systems. We investigate 25 chunking
configurations across five method families and evaluate 48 embedding models on
three chemistry-specific benchmarks, including the newly introduced
QuestChemRetrieval dataset. Our results reveal that recursive token-based
chunking (specifically R100-0) consistently outperforms other approaches,
offering strong performance with minimal resource overhead. We also find that
retrieval-optimized embeddings -- such as Nomic and Intfloat E5 variants --
substantially outperform domain-specialized models like SciBERT. By releasing
our datasets, evaluation framework, and empirical benchmarks, we provide

TL;DR: CORONA leverages LLMs for reasoning during candidate filtering in recommender systems, integrating GNNs for high-order interactions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work underutilizes LLMs in recommender systems, limiting them to re-ranking or dataset augmentation, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: CORONA uses LLMs for preference and intent reasoning to refine interaction subgraphs, followed by GNN-enhanced retrieval for final recommendations.

Result: CORONA improves recall by 18.6% and NDCG by 18.4% on average, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs' reasoning with GNNs in candidate filtering significantly enhances recommender system performance.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are designed to retrieve candidate items a user
might be interested in from a large pool. A common approach is using graph
neural networks (GNNs) to capture high-order interaction relationships. As
large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities across domains,
researchers are exploring their use to enhance recommendation. However, prior
work limits LLMs to re-ranking results or dataset augmentation, failing to
utilize their power during candidate filtering - which may lead to suboptimal
performance. Instead, we propose to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities during
the candidate filtering process, and introduce Chain Of Retrieval ON grAphs
(CORONA) to progressively narrow down the range of candidate items on
interaction graphs with the help of LLMs: (1) First, LLM performs preference
reasoning based on user profiles, with the response serving as a query to
extract relevant users and items from the interaction graph as
preference-assisted retrieval; (2) Then, using the information retrieved in the
previous step along with the purchase history of target user, LLM conducts
intent reasoning to help refine an even smaller interaction subgraph as
intent-assisted retrieval; (3) Finally, we employ a GNN to capture high-order
collaborative filtering information from the extracted subgraph, performing
GNN-enhanced retrieval to generate the final recommendation results. The
proposed framework leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs during the
retrieval process, while seamlessly integrating GNNs to enhance overall
recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets and
settings demonstrate that our proposed CORONA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an 18.6% relative improvement in recall and an 18.4% relative
improvement in NDCG on average.

*Jiale Zhang,Jiaxiang Chen,Zhucong Li,Jie Ding,Kui Zhao,Zenglin Xu,Xin Pang,Yinghui Xu*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SlimRAG is a lightweight framework for retrieval-augmented generation that replaces graph-based systems with an entity-aware mechanism, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based RAG systems suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval due to semantic similarity not implying relevance.

Method: SlimRAG uses an entity-to-chunk table for indexing and retrieves contextually relevant content without graph traversal.

Result: SlimRAG outperforms graph-based baselines in accuracy, reduces index size, and improves retrieval efficiency (e.g., RITU 16.31 vs. 56+).

Conclusion: SlimRAG demonstrates the effectiveness of structure-free, entity-centric retrieval for RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances language models by
incorporating external knowledge at inference time. However, graph-based RAG
systems often suffer from structural overhead and imprecise retrieval: they
require costly pipelines for entity linking and relation extraction, yet
frequently return subgraphs filled with loosely related or tangential content.
This stems from a fundamental flaw -- semantic similarity does not imply
semantic relevance. We introduce SlimRAG, a lightweight framework for retrieval
without graphs. SlimRAG replaces structure-heavy components with a simple yet
effective entity-aware mechanism. At indexing time, it constructs a compact
entity-to-chunk table based on semantic embeddings. At query time, it
identifies salient entities, retrieves and scores associated chunks, and
assembles a concise, contextually relevant input -- without graph traversal or
edge construction. To quantify retrieval efficiency, we propose Relative Index
Token Utilization (RITU), a metric measuring the compactness of retrieved
content. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that SlimRAG
outperforms strong flat and graph-based baselines in accuracy while reducing
index size and RITU (e.g., 16.31 vs. 56+), highlighting the value of
structure-free, entity-centric context selection. The code will be released
soon. https://github.com/continue-ai-company/SlimRAG

Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic generated a vast volume of publications, necessitating an efficient retrieval system for researchers during sudden pandemics.

Method: The authors leveraged LLMs to extract hidden relationships in unlabeled publications, enhancing the Covrelex-SE system's retrieval capabilities.

Result: The method improves the system's ability to provide high-quality search results by uncovering information not detectable by current parsing tools.

Conclusion: Using LLMs in retrieval systems can enhance information extraction and retrieval efficiency during pandemics like COVID-19.

Abstract: In recent years, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous
publications relevant to this disease have been issued. Because of the massive
volume of publications, an efficient retrieval system is necessary to provide
researchers with useful information if an unexpected pandemic happens so
suddenly, like COVID-19. In this work, we present a method to help the

results. We exploited the power of the large language models (LLMs) to extract
the hidden relationships inside the unlabeled publication that cannot be found
by the current parsing tools that the system is using. Since then, help the
system to have more useful information during retrieval progress.

TL;DR: A system for predicting citations by retrieving top-k similar abstracts and using an LLM for precise identification, evaluated on SCIDOCA 2025 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in distinguishing highly similar abstracts to accurately cite the correct paper.

Method: Retrieve top-k similar abstracts using relational features, then apply an LLM for precise citation identification.

Result: The framework proves effective in citation prediction on the SCIDOCA 2025 dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully addresses the citation discovery challenge by combining retrieval and LLM-based refinement.

Abstract: The Citation Discovery Shared Task focuses on predicting the correct citation
from a given candidate pool for a given paragraph. The main challenges stem
from the length of the abstract paragraphs and the high similarity among
candidate abstracts, making it difficult to determine the exact paper to cite.
To address this, we develop a system that first retrieves the top-k most
similar abstracts based on extracted relational features from the given
paragraph. From this subset, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to
accurately identify the most relevant citation. We evaluate our framework on
the training dataset provided by the SCIDOCA 2025 organizers, demonstrating its
effectiveness in citation prediction.

### [535] [Context-Aware Scientific Knowledge Extraction on Linked Open Data using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17580)
*Sajratul Y. Rubaiat,Hasan M. Jamil*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: WISE is a structured workflow for extracting and synthesizing scientific knowledge, outperforming traditional search engines and LLMs by reducing text processing and improving recall and depth of information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of extracting and synthesizing knowledge from the growing scientific literature, where traditional methods lack depth or efficiency, motivates the development of WISE.

Method: WISE uses an LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine and rank query-specific knowledge, employing dynamic scoring, adaptive stopping, and context-aware extraction.

Result: Experiments show WISE reduces processed text by 80% and achieves higher recall and uniqueness compared to baselines, with better depth of information.

Conclusion: WISE effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and can be adapted for diverse domains, enhancing knowledge extraction and synthesis.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers
extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many
sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer
concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search
capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete
answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific
Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured
workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an
LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned,
context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking
prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping
criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized
answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse
sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces
processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over
baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU
metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel
level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore
how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery,
material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction
and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.

*Zhijian Feng,Wenhao Zheng,Xuanji Xiao*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-scenario recommendation systems, using Double Q-learning and contrastive learning to model user interest evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User interests vary across scenarios, complicating unified modeling. Addressing this inconsistency is key for accurate recommendations.

Method: Uses Double Q-learning for next-item prediction and optimizes contrastive learning loss with Q-values.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-scenario recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: Provides a new perspective on multi-scenario modeling and suggests future research directions.

Abstract: In real-world recommendation systems, users would engage in variety
scenarios, such as homepages, search pages, and related recommendation pages.
Each of these scenarios would reflect different aspects users focus on.
However, the user interests may be inconsistent in different scenarios, due to
differences in decision-making processes and preference expression. This
variability complicates unified modeling, making multi-scenario learning a
significant challenge. To address this, we propose a novel reinforcement
learning approach that models user preferences across scenarios by modeling
user interest evolution across multiple scenarios. Our method employs Double
Q-learning to enhance next-item prediction accuracy and optimizes contrastive
learning loss using Q-value to make model performance better. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
multi-scenario recommendation tasks. Our work offers a fresh perspective on
multi-scenario modeling and highlights promising directions for future
research.

*Jiao Chen,Kehui Yao,Reza Yousefi Maragheh,Kai Zhao,Jianpeng Xu,Jason Cho,Evren Korpeoglu,Sushant Kumar,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CARTS is a multi-agent LLM framework for generating concise, relevant titles in recommendation systems, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM summarization methods don't suit recommendation systems due to strict relevance and length constraints.

Method: CARTS uses a three-stage multi-agent process: Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement, and arbitration.

Result: CARTS outperforms baselines in title relevance and user engagement in e-commerce A/B tests.

Conclusion: CARTS effectively addresses the unique challenges of textual summarization in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Current recommendation systems often require some form of textual data
summarization, such as generating concise and coherent titles for product
carousels or other grouped item displays. While large language models have
shown promise in NLP domains for textual summarization, these approaches do not
directly apply to recommendation systems, where explanations must be highly
relevant to the core features of item sets, adhere to strict word limit
constraints. In this paper, we propose CARTS (Collaborative Agents for
Recommendation Textual Summarization), a multi-agent LLM framework designed for
structured summarization in recommendation systems. CARTS decomposes the task
into three stages-Generation Augmented Generation (GAG), refinement circle, and
arbitration, where successive agent roles are responsible for extracting
salient item features, iteratively refining candidate titles based on relevance
and length feedback, and selecting the final title through a collaborative
arbitration process. Experiments on large-scale e-commerce data and live A/B
testing show that CARTS significantly outperforms single-pass and
chain-of-thought LLM baselines, delivering higher title relevance and improved
user engagement metrics.

*Catarina Pires,SÃ©rgio Nunes,LuÃ­s Filipe Teixeira*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores using a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to automate relevance judgments in medical case-based retrieval, reducing reliance on costly manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality manual relevance judgments are expensive and time-consuming, especially in complex domains like medical IR. Pooling methods only partially label datasets, creating a need for scalable alternatives.

Method: The study employs Gemini 1.5 Pro on the ImageCLEFmed 2013 task, using structured prompting (binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning) to simulate human judgments.

Result: The MLLM achieved substantial agreement (Cohen's Kappa: 0.6) with human judgments, expanding the dataset 37x to 558,653 annotations (5,950 relevant).

Conclusion: MLLMs can effectively scale relevance judgment collection, offering a viable solution for medical and multimodal IR evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems relies on high-quality manual
relevance judgments (qrels), which are costly and time-consuming to obtain.
While pooling reduces the annotation effort, it results in only partially
labeled datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to
reducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like
medical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing
both textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating
a new dataset of automated judgments. Specifically, we employ Gemini 1.5 Pro on
the ImageCLEFmed 2013 case-based retrieval task, simulating human assessment
through an iteratively refined, structured prompting strategy that integrates
binary scoring, instruction-based evaluation, and few-shot learning. We
systematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize
agreement with human judgments. To evaluate agreement between the MLLM and
human judgments, we use Cohen's Kappa, achieving a substantial agreement score
of 0.6, comparable to inter-annotator agreement typically observed in
multimodal retrieval tasks. Starting from the original 15,028 manual judgments
(4.72% relevant) across 35 topics, our MLLM-based approach expanded the dataset
by over 37x to 558,653 judgments, increasing relevant annotations to 5,950. On
average, each medical case query received 15,398 new annotations, with
approximately 99% being non-relevant, reflecting the high sparsity typical in
this domain. Our results demonstrate the potential of MLLMs to scale relevance
judgment collection, offering a promising direction for supporting retrieval
evaluation in medical and multimodal IR tasks.

*Vinaik Chhetri,Yousaf Reza,Moghis Fereidouni,Srijata Maji,Umar Farooq,AB Siddique*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ConvRecStudio unifies collaborative filtering and conversational recommendation systems by simulating realistic multi-turn dialogs using LLMs, improving personalization and achieving better performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation systems lack interactive mechanisms, while CRS lacks collaborative signals. Unifying these paradigms can enhance personalization but is hindered by the absence of large-scale conversational datasets.

Method: ConvRecStudio uses a three-stage pipeline: Temporal Profiling, Semantic Dialog Planning, and Multi-Turn Simulation with LLM agents, generating realistic dialogs grounded in user behavior.

Result: The framework produces 12K+ multi-turn dialogs per dataset, validated for naturalness and coherence. A cross-attention transformer model shows a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp.

Conclusion: ConvRecStudio successfully bridges the gap between collaborative filtering and CRS, demonstrating improved recommendation performance through unified modeling.

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems typically follow two complementary paradigms:
collaborative filtering, which models long-term user preferences from
historical interactions, and conversational recommendation systems (CRS), which
interact with users in natural language to uncover immediate needs. Each
captures a different dimension of user intent. While CRS models lack
collaborative signals, leading to generic or poorly personalized suggestions,
traditional recommenders lack mechanisms to interactively elicit immediate
needs. Unifying these paradigms promises richer personalization but remains
challenging due to the lack of large-scale conversational datasets grounded in
real user behavior. We present ConvRecStudio, a framework that uses large
language models (LLMs) to simulate realistic, multi-turn dialogs grounded in
timestamped user-item interactions and reviews. ConvRecStudio follows a
three-stage pipeline: (1) Temporal Profiling, which constructs user profiles
and community-level item sentiment trajectories over fine-grained aspects; (2)
Semantic Dialog Planning, which generates a structured plan using a DAG of
flexible super-nodes; and (3) Multi-Turn Simulation, which instantiates the
plan using paired LLM agents for the user and system, constrained by
executional and behavioral fidelity checks. We apply ConvRecStudio to three
domains -- MobileRec, Yelp, and Amazon Electronics -- producing over 12K
multi-turn dialogs per dataset. Human and automatic evaluations confirm the
naturalness, coherence, and behavioral grounding of the generated
conversations. To demonstrate utility, we build a cross-attention transformer
model that jointly encodes user history and dialog context, achieving gains in
Hit@K and NDCG@K over baselines using either signal alone or naive fusion.
Notably, our model achieves a 10.9% improvement in Hit@1 on Yelp over the
strongest baseline.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FAIRBridge is an AI-driven system that simplifies querying biological databases, even non-FAIR-compliant ones, by interpreting natural language and generating executable queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of efficiently accessing and integrating diverse, dynamic data sources in life sciences research, despite FAIR principles, motivates the need for automated solutions.

Method: FAIRBridge uses AI to interpret query intents, map to databases, generate executable queries, and mitigate low-quality processing.

Result: The system enables efficient, high-fidelity data access and querying, with tools for exploring alternatives and crowd curation.

Conclusion: FAIRBridge enhances scientific data integration, offering researchers a user-friendly, automated platform for hypothesis testing.

Abstract: Life sciences research increasingly requires identifying, accessing, and
effectively processing data from an ever-evolving array of information sources
on the Linked Open Data (LOD) network. This dynamic landscape places a
significant burden on researchers, as the quality of query responses depends
heavily on the selection and semantic integration of data sources --processes
that are often labor-intensive, error-prone, and costly. While the adoption of
FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles has
aimed to address these challenges, barriers to efficient and accurate
scientific data processing persist.
  In this paper, we introduce FAIRBridge, an experimental natural
language-based query processing system designed to empower scientists to
discover, access, and query biological databases, even when they are not
FAIR-compliant. FAIRBridge harnesses the capabilities of AI to interpret query
intents, map them to relevant databases described in scientific literature, and
generate executable queries via intelligent resource access plans. The system
also includes robust tools for mitigating low-quality query processing,
ensuring high fidelity and responsiveness in the information delivered.
  FAIRBridge's autonomous query processing framework enables users to explore
alternative data sources, make informed choices at every step, and leverage
community-driven crowd curation when needed. By providing a user-friendly,
automated hypothesis-testing platform in natural English, FAIRBridge
significantly enhances the integration and processing of scientific data,
offering researchers a powerful new tool for advancing their inquiries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve cross-domain sequential recommendation by leveraging multimodal data and capturing complex user preferences across domains.

Method: Uses LLM-enhanced text and CLIP-generated embeddings for multimodal fusion, with a multiple attention mechanism to learn intra- and inter-domain preferences.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on four e-commerce datasets, demonstrating superior modeling of cross-domain user preferences.

Conclusion: LLM-EMF effectively integrates multimodal data, enhancing sequential recommendation systems, with plans to release source code.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) predicts user behavior by
leveraging historical interactions across multiple domains, focusing on
modeling cross-domain preferences and capturing both intra- and inter-sequence
item relationships. We propose LLM-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion for Cross-Domain
Sequential Recommendation (LLM-EMF), a novel and advanced approach that
enhances textual information with Large Language Models (LLM) knowledge and
significantly improves recommendation performance through the fusion of visual
and textual data. Using the frozen CLIP model, we generate image and text
embeddings, thereby enriching item representations with multimodal data. A
multiple attention mechanism jointly learns both single-domain and cross-domain
preferences, effectively capturing and understanding complex user interests
across diverse domains. Evaluations conducted on four e-commerce datasets
demonstrate that LLM-EMF consistently outperforms existing methods in modeling
cross-domain user preferences, thereby highlighting the effectiveness of
multimodal data integration and its advantages in enhancing sequential
recommendation systems. Our source code will be released.

*Haotong Du,Yaqing Wang,Fei Xiong,Lei Shao,Ming Liu,Hao Gu,Quanming Yao,Zhen Wang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: PERSCEN is a novel method for multi-scenario recommendation that combines user-specific modeling with scenario-aware preferences, outperforming existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack user-specific modeling, limiting personalized recommendations in multi-scenario settings.

Method: PERSCEN uses a user-specific feature graph and graph neural network for shared preferences, and vector quantization for scenario-aware preferences, with a gated linear unit for fusion.

Result: PERSCEN outperforms existing methods and balances performance with computational cost.

Conclusion: PERSCEN is practical and effective for real-world industrial systems.

Abstract: With the expansion of business scales and scopes on online platforms,
multi-scenario matching has become a mainstream solution to reduce maintenance
costs and alleviate data sparsity. The key to effective multi-scenario
recommendation lies in capturing both user preferences shared across all
scenarios and scenario-aware preferences specific to each scenario. However,
existing methods often overlook user-specific modeling, limiting the generation
of personalized user representations. To address this, we propose PERSCEN, an
innovative approach that incorporates user-specific modeling into
multi-scenario matching. PERSCEN constructs a user-specific feature graph based
on user characteristics and employs a lightweight graph neural network to
capture higher-order interaction patterns, enabling personalized extraction of
preferences shared across scenarios. Additionally, we leverage vector
quantization techniques to distil scenario-aware preferences from users'
behavior sequence within individual scenarios, facilitating user-specific and
scenario-aware preference modeling. To enhance efficient and flexible
information transfer, we introduce a progressive scenario-aware gated linear
unit that allows fine-grained, low-latency fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PERSCEN outperforms existing methods. Further efficiency
analysis confirms that PERSCEN effectively balances performance with
computational cost, ensuring its practicality for real-world industrial
systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LettinGo is a framework using LLMs and DPO to create adaptive, diverse user profiles for recommendation systems, improving accuracy and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional embedding-based profiles lack interpretability and adaptability, while fixed-format text-based profiles fail to capture user behavior diversity.

Method: LettinGo uses LLMs to explore diverse profiles, evaluates them via recommendation task impact, and aligns generation using DPO and pairwise preference data.

Result: The framework enhances recommendation accuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness.

Conclusion: LettinGo advances profile generation for next-gen recommendation systems.

Abstract: User profiling is pivotal for recommendation systems, as it transforms raw
user interaction data into concise and structured representations that drive
personalized recommendations. While traditional embedding-based profiles lack
interpretability and adaptability, recent advances with large language models
(LLMs) enable text-based profiles that are semantically richer and more
transparent. However, existing methods often adhere to fixed formats that limit
their ability to capture the full diversity of user behaviors. In this paper,
we introduce LettinGo, a novel framework for generating diverse and adaptive
user profiles. By leveraging the expressive power of LLMs and incorporating
direct feedback from downstream recommendation tasks, our approach avoids the
rigid constraints imposed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Instead, we employ
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the profile generator with
task-specific performance, ensuring that the profiles remain adaptive and
effective. LettinGo operates in three stages: (1) exploring diverse user
profiles via multiple LLMs, (2) evaluating profile quality based on their
impact in recommendation systems, and (3) aligning the profile generation
through pairwise preference data derived from task performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances recommendation
accuracy, flexibility, and contextual awareness. This work enhances profile
generation as a key innovation for next-generation recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overlooked biases in item categories and extend fair re-ranking beyond binary-sensitive attributes to ensure balanced recommendations.

Method: Leverages existing biases to correct disparities, focusing on multiple sensitive attributes. Evaluated on three real-world datasets.

Result: Effectively mitigates social bias with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: The approach successfully balances fairness and performance in recommendation systems.

Abstract: Recommendation systems play a crucial role in our daily lives by impacting
user experience across various domains, including e-commerce, job
advertisements, entertainment, etc. Given the vital role of such systems in our
lives, practitioners must ensure they do not produce unfair and imbalanced
recommendations. Previous work addressing bias in recommendations overlooked
bias in certain item categories, potentially leaving some biases unaddressed.
Additionally, most previous work on fair re-ranking focused on binary-sensitive
attributes. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing a
fairness-aware re-ranking approach that helps mitigate bias in different
categories of items. This re-ranking approach leverages existing biases to
correct disparities in recommendations across various demographic groups. We
show how our approach can mitigate bias on multiple sensitive attributes,
including gender, age, and occupation. We experimented on three real-world
datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our re-ranking scheme in mitigating
bias in recommendations. Our results show how this approach helps mitigate
social bias with little to no degradation in performance.

TL;DR: OmniESI is a two-stage conditional deep learning framework for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by incorporating catalytic patterns and enabling diverse downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing predictive methods lack integration of prior catalytic knowledge, leading to misalignment with catalytic patterns. OmniESI addresses this gap.

Method: OmniESI uses two conditional networks to progressively modulate features from general protein-molecule to catalysis-aware domains.

Result: OmniESI outperforms specialized methods across seven benchmarks, with negligible parameter increase (0.16%).

Conclusion: OmniESI is a unified, generalizable tool for catalytic mechanism research and enzyme engineering.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling enzyme-substrate interactions is crucial for
catalytic mechanism research, enzyme engineering, and metabolic engineering.
Although a large number of predictive methods have emerged, they do not
incorporate prior knowledge of enzyme catalysis to rationally modulate general
protein-molecule features that are misaligned with catalytic patterns. To
address this issue, we introduce a two-stage progressive framework, OmniESI,
for enzyme-substrate interaction prediction through conditional deep learning.
By decomposing the modeling of enzyme-substrate interactions into a two-stage
progressive process, OmniESI incorporates two conditional networks that
respectively emphasize enzymatic reaction specificity and crucial
catalysis-related interactions, facilitating a gradual feature modulation in
the latent space from general protein-molecule domain to catalysis-aware
domain. On top of this unified architecture, OmniESI can adapt to a variety of
downstream tasks, including enzyme kinetic parameter prediction,
enzyme-substrate pairing prediction, enzyme mutational effect prediction, and
enzymatic active site annotation. Under the multi-perspective performance
evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, OmniESI
consistently delivered superior performance than state-of-the-art specialized
methods across seven benchmarks. More importantly, the proposed conditional
networks were shown to internalize the fundamental patterns of catalytic
efficiency while significantly improving prediction performance, with only
negligible parameter increases (0.16%), as demonstrated by ablation studies on
key components. Overall, OmniESI represents a unified predictive approach for
enzyme-substrate interactions, providing an effective tool for catalytic
mechanism cracking and enzyme engineering with strong generalization and broad
applicability.

TL;DR: AbRank introduces a benchmark for antibody-antigen binding affinity prediction, reframing it as a ranking problem with standardized data splits and robust supervision. WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based method, serves as a baseline, showing improved robustness and transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for antibody-antigen binding affinity prediction suffer from noisy labels, heterogeneous conditions, and poor generalization. AbRank aims to address these limitations.

Method: AbRank aggregates 380,000 binding assays, introduces standardized data splits, and uses an m-confident ranking framework. WALLE-Affinity integrates protein language models with structural information.

Result: Benchmarks show current methods struggle with generalization, but ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability.

Conclusion: AbRank provides a robust foundation for scalable, structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) binding affinity is essential
for therapeutic design and vaccine development, yet the performance of current
models is limited by noisy experimental labels, heterogeneous assay conditions,
and poor generalization across the vast antibody and antigen sequence space. We
introduce AbRank, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework that
reframes affinity prediction as a pairwise ranking problem. AbRank aggregates
over 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse
antibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized
data splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local
perturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel
antigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an
m-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal
affinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold
difference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we
introduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein
language model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise
binding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current
methods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that
ranking-based training improves robustness and transferability. In summary,
AbRank offers a robust foundation for machine learning models to generalize
across the antibody-antigen space, with direct relevance for scalable,
structure-aware antibody therapeutic design.

Method: The authors extend the two-agent Overcooked benchmark to N-agent scenarios (N-player Overcooked) and propose N-XPlay for ZSC in multi-team settings.

Result: N-XPlay-trained agents outperform Self-Play in balancing intra-team and inter-team coordination in two-, three-, and five-player scenarios.

Conclusion: N-XPlay enhances ZSC in multi-agent, multi-team environments, demonstrating its superiority over traditional methods.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination (ZSC) -- the ability to collaborate with unfamiliar
partners -- is essential to making autonomous agents effective teammates.
Existing ZSC methods evaluate coordination capabilities between two agents who
have not previously interacted. However, these scenarios do not reflect the
complexity of real-world multi-agent systems, where coordination often involves
a hierarchy of sub-groups and interactions between teams of agents, known as
Multi-Team Systems (MTS). To address this gap, we first introduce N-player
Overcooked, an N-agent extension of the popular two-agent ZSC benchmark,
enabling evaluation of ZSC in N-agent scenarios. We then propose N-XPlay for
ZSC in N-agent, multi-team settings. Comparison against Self-Play across two-,
three- and five-player Overcooked scenarios, where agents are split between an
``ego-team'' and a group of unseen collaborators shows that agents trained with
N-XPlay are better able to simultaneously balance ``intra-team'' and
``inter-team'' coordination than agents trained with SP.

TL;DR: BlenderFusion is a framework for generative visual compositing, enabling scene synthesis by recomposing objects, camera, and background through a layering-editing-compositing pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of complex compositional scene editing by providing a flexible and coherent method for modifying visual inputs.

Method: Uses a three-step pipeline: layering (segmenting inputs into editable 3D entities), editing (3D-grounded control in Blender), and compositing (fusing scenes with a generative diffusion model). Key training strategies include source masking and simulated object jittering.

Result: Outperforms prior methods in complex scene editing tasks.

Conclusion: BlenderFusion offers an effective solution for generative visual compositing with disentangled control over objects and camera.

Abstract: We present BlenderFusion, a generative visual compositing framework that
synthesizes new scenes by recomposing objects, camera, and background. It
follows a layering-editing-compositing pipeline: (i) segmenting and converting
visual inputs into editable 3D entities (layering), (ii) editing them in
Blender with 3D-grounded control (editing), and (iii) fusing them into a
coherent scene using a generative compositor (compositing). Our generative
compositor extends a pre-trained diffusion model to process both the original
(source) and edited (target) scenes in parallel. It is fine-tuned on video
frames with two key training strategies: (i) source masking, enabling flexible
modifications like background replacement; (ii) simulated object jittering,
facilitating disentangled control over objects and camera. BlenderFusion
significantly outperforms prior methods in complex compositional scene editing
tasks.

*Shihan Chen,Zhaojin Li,Zeyu Chen,Qingsong Yan,Gaoyang Shen,Ran Duan*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel method for large-scale 3D surface reconstruction using a coarse-to-fine strategy, adaptive partitioning, and decoupled appearance modeling, outperforming existing NeRF and Gaussian-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of scaling 3D Gaussian Splatting to large scenes with dynamic appearances, particularly for aerial surveying and autonomous driving.

Method: Coarse-to-fine reconstruction, adaptive scene partitioning, decoupling appearance model, transient mask model, multi-view constraint expansion, and single-view regularization.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity visual results and accurate surfaces on the GauU-Scene V2 dataset, surpassing NeRF and Gaussian-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reconstructs large-scale scenes with fine details and handles dynamic appearances, with open-source code for future use.

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have made significant advances
in surface reconstruction. However, scaling these methods to large-scale scenes
remains challenging due to high computational demands and the complex dynamic
appearances typical of outdoor environments. These challenges hinder the
application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a
novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details,
supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine
strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene
partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we
integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations
and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects.
Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view
regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the
publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned
aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing
NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results
and accurate surface from full-size image optimization. Open-source code will
be available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces novel algorithms for texture filtering using GPU wave communication to avoid repeated texel decompression, improving quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stochastic texture filtering (STF) techniques suffer from visual artifacts and inefficiency under magnification, prompting the need for better methods.

Method: Leverages GPU wave communication intrinsics to share decoded texel values between pixels, reducing decompression overhead and introducing fallback methods for high-quality filtering.

Result: Achieves zero-error filtering with minimal texel evaluations and higher quality than prior approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed methods enhance texture filtering quality and efficiency, addressing limitations of existing STF techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in texture compression provide major improvements in
compression ratios, but cannot use the GPU's texture units for decompression
and filtering. This has led to the development of stochastic texture filtering
(STF) techniques to avoid the high cost of multiple texel evaluations with such
formats. Unfortunately, those methods can give undesirable visual appearance
changes under magnification and may contain visible noise and flicker despite
the use of spatiotemporal denoisers. Recent work substantially improves the
quality of magnification filtering with STF by sharing decoded texel values
between nearby pixels (Wronski 2025). Using GPU wave communication intrinsics,
this sharing can be performed inside actively executing shaders without memory
traffic overhead. We take this idea further and present novel algorithms that
use wave communication between lanes to avoid repeated texel decompression
prior to filtering. By distributing unique work across lanes, we can achieve
zero-error filtering using <=1 texel evaluations per pixel given a sufficiently
large magnification factor. For the remaining cases, we propose novel filtering
fallback methods that also achieve higher quality than prior approaches.

TL;DR: SeamGPT is an auto-regressive model for surface cutting, mimicking professional workflows to generate semantically coherent seams, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surface cutting methods produce fragmented atlases lacking semantic coherence, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Formulates surface cutting as a next token prediction task using a GPT-style transformer to predict seam segments from encoded shape conditions.

Result: Achieves exceptional performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks and improves 3D segmentation tools by providing clean boundaries.

Conclusion: SeamGPT offers a novel, effective approach to surface cutting, enhancing both UV unwrapping and mesh decomposition.

Abstract: Surface cutting is a fundamental task in computer graphics, with applications
in UV parameterization, texture mapping, and mesh decomposition. However,
existing methods often produce technically valid but overly fragmented atlases
that lack semantic coherence. We introduce SeamGPT, an auto-regressive model
that generates cutting seams by mimicking professional workflows. Our key
technical innovation lies in formulating surface cutting as a next token
prediction task: sample point clouds on mesh vertices and edges, encode them as
shape conditions, and employ a GPT-style transformer to sequentially predict
seam segments with quantized 3D coordinates. Our approach achieves exceptional
performance on UV unwrapping benchmarks containing both manifold and
non-manifold meshes, including artist-created, and 3D-scanned models. In
addition, it enhances existing 3D segmentation tools by providing clean
boundaries for part decomposition.

*Chao Li,Jiawei Fan,Anbang Yao*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Morse is a dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly using fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback. It involves two models, Dash and Dot, working together to improve efficiency without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accelerate diffusion models without losing quality by leveraging jump sampling and residual feedback.

Method: Uses two models: Dash (pre-trained diffusion model with jump sampling) and Dot (faster model generating residual feedback). They interact to improve efficiency.

Result: Achieves 1.78X to 3.31X speedup over baselines on 6 image generation tasks, and generalizes to Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL).

Conclusion: Morse provides a flexible, efficient, and lossless acceleration for diffusion models, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for
accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to
reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking
advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.
Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with
each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,
but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling
efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash
model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the
observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash
model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the
Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot
models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly
attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime
efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot
models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a
lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling
step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve
the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with
consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image
synthesis. The code and models are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces the WYTWYG framework, using MLLMs to guide transfer function (TF) optimization in direct volume rendering, addressing challenges of large exploration space and weak generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Designing effective TFs in direct volume rendering is unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameters. Existing methods struggle with large exploration spaces and lack generalizability.

Method: The WYTWYG framework includes an evolution-based explorer for TF space exploration and an MLLM-based evaluator for visual guidance. A TF interactive design system is also proposed.

Result: The framework is validated through case studies and experiments, demonstrating its general applicability and component effectiveness.

Conclusion: The WYTWYG framework successfully bridges the gap between user intent and TF optimization, offering a more intuitive and generalizable solution.

Abstract: Direct volume rendering (DVR) is a fundamental technique for visualizing
volumetric data, with transfer functions (TFs) playing a crucial role in
extracting meaningful structures. However, designing effective TFs remains
unintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.
Researchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.
However, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space
and weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think
is What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically,
we first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core
components: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF
space, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide
generalizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design
system based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our
framework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each
component through extensive experiments. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: BulletGen uses generative models to enhance 4D Gaussian-based dynamic scene reconstruction by aligning diffusion-based video generation with frozen frames, achieving top results in novel-view synthesis and tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in reconstructing unseen regions and addressing ambiguity in monocular depth estimation from casually captured videos.

Method: Aligns diffusion-based video generation with a 4D Gaussian model at a frozen step, using generated frames to supervise optimization.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Conclusion: BulletGen effectively blends generative content with dynamic scenes, improving reconstruction and tracking accuracy.

Abstract: Transforming casually captured, monocular videos into fully immersive dynamic
experiences is a highly ill-posed task, and comes with significant challenges,
e.g., reconstructing unseen regions, and dealing with the ambiguity in
monocular depth estimation. In this work we introduce BulletGen, an approach
that takes advantage of generative models to correct errors and complete
missing information in a Gaussian-based dynamic scene representation. This is
done by aligning the output of a diffusion-based video generation model with
the 4D reconstruction at a single frozen "bullet-time" step. The generated
frames are then used to supervise the optimization of the 4D Gaussian model.
Our method seamlessly blends generative content with both static and dynamic
scene components, achieving state-of-the-art results on both novel-view
synthesis, and 2D/3D tracking tasks.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DuetGen is a framework for generating interactive two-person dances from music using a two-stage approach with hierarchical tokenization and masked transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in synchronizing two dancers with each other and the music, requiring a method to capture intricate interactions.

Method: A two-stage solution: encoding motions into discrete tokens (VQ-VAE) and generating tokens from music (masked transformers). Hierarchical coarse-to-fine learning is used.

Result: DuetGen produces synchronized and interactive dances, excelling in realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.

Conclusion: DuetGen sets a new benchmark for generating two-person dances, demonstrating effectiveness in capturing complex interactions and synchronization.

Abstract: We present DuetGen, a novel framework for generating interactive two-person
dances from music. The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent
complexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to
synchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent
advances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding
two-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from
music. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both
dancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and
adopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage
utilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at
a coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,
producing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.
Subsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to
map music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level
semantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic
tokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to
predict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to
iteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during
inference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction
representation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive
two-person dances across various genres. Extensive experiments and user studies
on a benchmark duet dance dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
DuetGen in motion realism, music-dance alignment, and partner coordination.

### [558] [New Hardness Results for Low-Rank Matrix Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18440)
*Dror Chawin,Ishay Haviv*

Main category: cs.CC

TL;DR: The paper proves new NP-hardness results for low-rank matrix completion problems, strengthening prior work and introducing novel proof techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The problem of low-rank matrix completion arises in many fields and has practical applications, but its computational complexity is not fully understood.

Method: The authors use nearly orthonormal graph representations, line digraphs, and rank bounds on perturbed identity matrices to establish NP-hardness.

Result: They show NP-hardness for finding approximate positive semi-definite or bounded infinity norm completions, even with relaxed rank constraints.

Conclusion: The results deepen understanding of the computational limits of low-rank matrix completion and introduce new techniques for hardness proofs.

Abstract: The low-rank matrix completion problem asks whether a given real matrix with
missing values can be completed so that the resulting matrix has low rank or is
close to a low-rank matrix. The completed matrix is often required to satisfy
additional structural constraints, such as positive semi-definiteness or a
bounded infinity norm. The problem arises in various research fields, including
machine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad
real-world applications.
  This paper presents new $\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix
completion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and
any real number $\varepsilon \in [ 2^{-O(d)},\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial
matrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive
semi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a
positive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an
additive error of at most $\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to
exceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\frac{1}{\varepsilon ^2 \cdot
\log(1/\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,
and Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than
$2$ and to $\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar
$\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is
constrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive
semi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity
assumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture. Our proofs involve a novel
notion of nearly orthonormal representations of graphs, the concept of line
digraphs, and bounds on the rank of perturbed identity matrices.

*Yuan Zhong,Ruinan Jin,Xiaoxiao Li,Qi Dou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Common VLMs, when fine-tuned, can match or outperform medical-specific VLMs in medical imaging tasks, offering a cost-effective alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if fine-tuned common VLMs can compete with medical-specific VLMs in medical imaging tasks, reducing resource needs.

Method: Systematic evaluation of CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models in disease diagnosis and VQA, comparing off-the-shelf performance, fine-tuning impact, and OOD generalization.

Result: Common VLMs rival medical VLMs after lightweight fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA), showing strong adaptability in OOD tasks.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned common VLMs are a scalable, cost-effective alternative to medical-specific VLMs, challenging the necessity of medical pretraining.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) leverage large-scale pretraining for
diverse imaging tasks but require substantial computational and data resources.
Meanwhile, common or general-purpose VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA), though not
trained for medical use, show promise with fine-tuning. This raises a key
question: Can efficient fine-tuned common VLMs rival generalist medical VLMs
for solving specific medical imaging tasks? This study systematically evaluates
common and medical VLMs across disease diagnosis and visual question answering
(VQA). Using CLIP-based and LLaVA-based models, we examine (1) off-the-shelf
performance gaps in in-domain (ID) settings, (2) whether fine-tuning bridges
these gaps, and (3) generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) tasks on unseen
medical modalities. While medical-specific pretraining provides advantages in
ID settings, common VLMs match or surpass medical-specific models after
lightweight fine-tuning, with LoRA-based adaptation proving highly effective
among different tasks. In OOD tasks, common VLMs demonstrate strong
adaptability in some tasks, challenging the assumption that medical-specific
pre-training is essential. These findings suggest that leveraging common VLMs
with fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to developing
large-scale medical VLMs, providing crucial insights for future research in the
medical imaging field.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A GAN-based framework (MTSIC) enhances TIR image colorization using multi-band spectral data and self-attention mechanisms, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIR images lack color/texture, limiting tasks and causing visual fatigue. Existing methods use single-band data, leading to distortion and ambiguity.

Method: Proposes MTSIC with multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer (STformer) and spatial-spectral attention residual blocks (SARB) for multi-band feature mapping.

Result: Significantly outperforms traditional techniques, improving visual quality of infrared images.

Conclusion: MTSIC effectively integrates spectral data, reduces semantic confusion, and enhances infrared image colorization.

Abstract: Thermal infrared (TIR) images, acquired through thermal radiation imaging,
are unaffected by variations in lighting conditions and atmospheric haze.
However, TIR images inherently lack color and texture information, limiting
downstream tasks and potentially causing visual fatigue. Existing colorization
methods primarily rely on single-band images with limited spectral information
and insufficient feature extraction capabilities, which often result in image
distortion and semantic ambiguity. In contrast, multiband infrared imagery
provides richer spectral data, facilitating the preservation of finer details
and enhancing semantic accuracy. In this paper, we propose a generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based framework designed to integrate spectral
information to enhance the colorization of infrared images. The framework
employs a multi-stage spectral self-attention Transformer network (MTSIC) as
the generator. Each spectral feature is treated as a token for self-attention
computation, and a multi-head self-attention mechanism forms a spatial-spectral
attention residual block (SARB), achieving multi-band feature mapping and
reducing semantic confusion. Multiple SARB units are integrated into a
Transformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped
architecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale
wavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency
dual domain. Multiple STformer modules are cascaded to form MTSIC,
progressively optimizing the reconstruction quality. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional
techniques and effectively enhances the visual quality of infrared images.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A machine learning framework predicts no-reflow post-EVT using intra-procedural DSA sequences and clinical data, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: No-reflow after EVT worsens outcomes; current MRI-based detection is delayed. Early prediction is needed for timely intervention.

Method: ML classifiers trained on DSA sequence features and clinical variables to predict no-reflow in AIS patients.

Result: ML method achieved higher AUC (0.7703) and accuracy (0.8125) than clinical-features baseline.

Conclusion: DSA-based ML enables real-time no-reflow prediction, improving patient management without delayed imaging.

Abstract: Following successful large-vessel recanalization via endovascular
thrombectomy (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), some patients experience a
complication known as no-reflow, defined by persistent microvascular
hypoperfusion that undermines tissue recovery and worsens clinical outcomes.
Although prompt identification is crucial, standard clinical practice relies on
perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24 hours post-procedure,
delaying intervention. In this work, we introduce the first-ever machine
learning (ML) framework to predict no-reflow immediately after EVT by
leveraging previously unexplored intra-procedural digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) sequences and clinical variables. Our retrospective analysis
included AIS patients treated at UCLA Medical Center (2011-2024) who achieved
favorable mTICI scores (2b-3) and underwent pre- and post-procedure MRI.
No-reflow was defined as persistent hypoperfusion (Tmax > 6 s) on
post-procedural imaging. From DSA sequences (AP and lateral views), we
extracted statistical and temporal perfusion features from the target
downstream territory to train ML classifiers for predicting no-reflow. Our
novel method significantly outperformed a clinical-features baseline(AUC:
0.7703 $\pm$ 0.12 vs. 0.5728 $\pm$ 0.12; accuracy: 0.8125 $\pm$ 0.10 vs. 0.6331
$\pm$ 0.09), demonstrating that real-time DSA perfusion dynamics encode
critical insights into microvascular integrity. This approach establishes a
foundation for immediate, accurate no-reflow prediction, enabling clinicians to
proactively manage high-risk patients without reliance on delayed imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LVPNet improves lossless medical image compression by using global latent variables and quantization compensation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from posterior collapse and inefficient latent variable use due to uniform information distribution in sub-images.

Method: Proposes LVPNet with Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM) for latent representation and Quantization Compensation Module (QCM) to refine features.

Result: Achieves superior compression efficiency and competitive inference speed on benchmarks.

Conclusion: LVPNet effectively addresses limitations of prior methods, enhancing lossless compression performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive Initial Bits is a framework that integrates sub-image
autoregression and latent variable modeling, demonstrating its advantages in
lossless medical image compression. However, in existing methods, the image
segmentation process leads to an even distribution of latent variable
information across each sub-image, which in turn causes posterior collapse and
inefficient utilization of latent variables. To deal with these issues, we
propose a prediction-based end-to-end lossless medical image compression method
named LVPNet, leveraging global latent variables to predict pixel values and
encoding predicted probabilities for lossless compression. Specifically, we
introduce the Global Multi-scale Sensing Module (GMSM), which extracts compact
and informative latent representations from the entire image, effectively
capturing spatial dependencies within the latent space. Furthermore, to
mitigate the information loss introduced during quantization, we propose the
Quantization Compensation Module (QCM), which learns the distribution of
quantization errors and refines the quantized features to compensate for
quantization loss. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves superior compression efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art lossless image compression approaches, while maintaining
competitive inference speed. The code is at

TL;DR: MÂ³Bind is a pre-training framework that aligns multiple medical imaging modalities through a shared text space without needing paired data, outperforming CLIP-like models in tasks like classification and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image analysis requires aligned feature representations across modalities, but existing methods like CLIP need paired data, which is hard to acquire in medical contexts.

Method: MÂ³Bind fine-tunes CLIP-like models to align modality-specific text embeddings and distills them into a unified model for a shared text space.

Result: MÂ³Bind achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification, and cross-modal retrieval on diverse medical imaging tasks.

Conclusion: MÂ³Bind effectively enables cross-modal alignment in medical image analysis without requiring explicit paired data.

Abstract: Medical image analysis increasingly relies on the integration of multiple
imaging modalities to capture complementary anatomical and functional
information, enabling more accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Achieving
aligned feature representations across these diverse modalities is therefore
important for effective multimodal analysis. While contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) and its variant have enabled image-text alignments, they
require explicitly paired data between arbitrary two modalities, which is
difficult to acquire in medical contexts. To address the gap, we present
Multimodal Medical Image Binding with Text (M\textsuperscript{3}Bind), a novel
pre-training framework that enables seamless alignment of multiple medical
imaging modalities through a shared text representation space without requiring
explicit paired data between any two medical image modalities. Specifically,
based on the insight that different images can naturally bind with text,
M\textsuperscript{3}Bind first fine-tunes pre-trained CLIP-like image-text
models to align their modality-specific text embedding space while preserving
their original image-text alignments. Subsequently, we distill these
modality-specific text encoders into a unified model, creating a shared text
embedding space. Experiments on X-ray, CT, retina, ECG, and pathological images
on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that M\textsuperscript{3}Bind achieves
state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, few-shot classification and
cross-modal retrieval tasks compared to its CLIP-like counterparts. These
results validate M\textsuperscript{3}Bind's effectiveness in achieving
cross-image-modal alignment for medical analysis.

*Sara Rehmat,Hafeez Ur Rehman*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework translates H&E-stained images to high-fidelity IHC images for HER2 assessment, outperforming existing methods and offering a cost-effective diagnostic alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HER2-positive breast cancer requires precise diagnosis, but standard IHC is costly and labor-intensive, while H&E lacks specificity.

Method: Modified pyramid pix2pix with a novel variance-based penalty to mitigate GAN mode collapse and enhance structural diversity.

Result: Superior performance in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, with high PSNR, SSIM, and FID scores.

Conclusion: The model advances AI-driven precision oncology, providing a scalable and efficient HER2 diagnostic tool.

Abstract: The overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in
breast cells is a key driver of HER2-positive breast cancer, a highly
aggressive subtype requiring precise diagnosis and targeted therapy.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the standard technique for HER2 assessment but is
costly, labor-intensive, and highly dependent on antibody selection. In
contrast, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, a routine histopathological
procedure, offers broader accessibility but lacks HER2 specificity. This study
proposes an advanced deep learning-based image translation framework to
generate highfidelity IHC images from H&E-stained tissue samples, enabling
cost-effective and scalable HER2 assessment. By modifying the loss function of
pyramid pix2pix, we mitigate mode collapse, a fundamental limitation in
generative adversarial networks (GANs), and introduce a novel variance-based
penalty that enforces structural diversity in generated images. Our model
particularly excels in translating HER2-positive (IHC 3+) images, which have
remained challenging for existing methods due to their complex morphological
variations. Extensive evaluations on the BCI histopathological dataset
demonstrate that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak
signal-tonoise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Frechet
Inception Distance (FID), particularly in accurately translating HER2-positive
(IHC 3+) images. Beyond medical imaging, our model exhibits superior
performance in general image-to-image translation tasks, showcasing its
potential across multiple domains. This work marks a significant step toward
AI-driven precision oncology, offering a reliable and efficient alternative to
traditional HER2 diagnostics.

*Haoneng Lin,Cheng Xu,Jing Qin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A review of adapting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for medical image analysis, covering strategies, challenges, and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs show promise in medical image analysis but face challenges like domain gaps and task diversity, necessitating systematic adaptation strategies.

Method: Summarizes core learning strategies (pretraining, fine-tuning, prompt learning) and categorizes five VLM adaptation strategies across eleven medical imaging tasks.

Result: Highlights current implementations, key challenges, and potential future research directions.

Conclusion: The review aims to guide researchers in leveraging VLMs for medical image analysis, addressing limitations and promoting safe clinical application.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in
cross-modal semantic understanding between visual and textual modalities. Given
the intrinsic need for multi-modal integration in clinical applications, VLMs
have emerged as a promising solution for a wide range of medical image analysis
tasks. However, adapting general-purpose VLMs to medical domain poses numerous
challenges, such as large domain gaps, complicated pathological variations, and
diversity and uniqueness of different tasks. The central purpose of this review
is to systematically summarize recent advances in adapting VLMs for medical
image analysis, analyzing current challenges, and recommending promising yet
urgent directions for further investigations. We begin by introducing core
learning strategies for medical VLMs, including pretraining, fine-tuning, and
prompt learning. We then categorize five major VLM adaptation strategies for
medical image analysis. These strategies are further analyzed across eleven
medical imaging tasks to illustrate their current practical implementations.
Furthermore, we analyze key challenges that impede the effective adaptation of
VLMs to clinical applications and discuss potential directions for future
research. We also provide an open-access repository of related literature to
facilitate further research, available at
https://github.com/haonenglin/Awesome-VLM-for-MIA. It is anticipated that this
article can help researchers who are interested in harnessing VLMs in medical
image analysis tasks have a better understanding on their capabilities and
limitations, as well as current technical barriers, to promote their
innovative, robust, and safe application in clinical practice.

*Atifa Kalsoom,M. A. Iftikhar,Amjad Ali,Zubair Shah,Shidin Balakrishnan,Hazrat Ali*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces BLCB-CNN, a deep learning pipeline with a bi-level class balancing scheme for retinal blood vessel segmentation, achieving high performance metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels is challenging due to imbalanced data and varying vessel thickness, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Uses a CNN with bi-level class balancing (vessel/non-vessel and thick/thin vessel balancing) and pre-processing techniques like GCN, CLAHE, and gamma correction.

Result: Achieved 98.23% AUC, 96.22% accuracy, 81.57% sensitivity, and 97.65% specificity, with successful cross-validation on STARE images.

Conclusion: BLCB-CNN is effective for retinal vessel segmentation, demonstrating high accuracy and generalization capability.

Abstract: Retinal fundus images provide valuable insights into the human eye's interior
structure and crucial features, such as blood vessels, optic disk, macula, and
fovea. However, accurate segmentation of retinal blood vessels can be
challenging due to imbalanced data distribution and varying vessel thickness.
In this paper, we propose BLCB-CNN, a novel pipeline based on deep learning and
bi-level class balancing scheme to achieve vessel segmentation in retinal
fundus images. The BLCB-CNN scheme uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture and an empirical approach to balance the distribution of pixels
across vessel and non-vessel classes and within thin and thick vessels. Level-I
is used for vessel/non-vessel balancing and Level-II is used for thick/thin
vessel balancing. Additionally, pre-processing of the input retinal fundus
image is performed by Global Contrast Normalization (GCN), Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), and gamma corrections to increase
intensity uniformity as well as to enhance the contrast between vessels and
background pixels. The resulting balanced dataset is used for
classification-based segmentation of the retinal vascular tree. We evaluate the
proposed scheme on standard retinal fundus images and achieve superior
performance measures, including an area under the ROC curve of 98.23%, Accuracy
of 96.22%, Sensitivity of 81.57%, and Specificity of 97.65%. We also
demonstrate the method's efficacy through external cross-validation on STARE
images, confirming its generalization ability.

*Daniel M. Lang,Richard Osuala,Veronika Spieker,Karim Lekadir,Rickmer Braren,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: TeNCA improves synthetic contrast enhancement in breast MRI by modeling temporal evolution using neural cellular automata, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long acquisition times and high costs limit MRI's use in breast imaging. Synthetic contrast enhancement can address these issues, but current methods lack temporal consistency.

Method: TeNCA extends neural cellular automata (NCA) to model sparse, non-uniformly sampled data. It uses adaptive loss computation and iterative training to mimic physical progression.

Result: TeNCA outperforms SOTA methods, generating images that better align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.

Conclusion: TeNCA offers a robust solution for synthetic contrast enhancement, improving temporal consistency and physiological plausibility.

Abstract: Synthetic contrast enhancement offers fast image acquisition and eliminates
the need for intravenous injection of contrast agent. This is particularly
beneficial for breast imaging, where long acquisition times and high cost are
significantly limiting the applicability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as
a widespread screening modality. Recent studies have demonstrated the
feasibility of synthetic contrast generation. However, current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods lack sufficient measures for consistent temporal evolution.
Neural cellular automata (NCA) offer a robust and lightweight architecture to
model evolving patterns between neighboring cells or pixels. In this work we
introduce TeNCA (Temporal Neural Cellular Automata), which extends and further
refines NCAs to effectively model temporally sparse, non-uniformly sampled
imaging data. To achieve this, we advance the training strategy by enabling
adaptive loss computation and define the iterative nature of the method to
resemble a physical progression in time. This conditions the model to learn a
physiologically plausible evolution of contrast enhancement. We rigorously
train and test TeNCA on a diverse breast MRI dataset and demonstrate its
effectiveness, surpassing the performance of existing methods in generation of
images that align with ground truth post-contrast sequences.

TL;DR: A CT radiomics-based explainable ML model was developed for diagnosing endometrial cancer (EC), achieving high accuracy (AUC 0.96) and clinical utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary interventions in EC by leveraging explainable ML and radiomics.

Method: Used 83 EC patients' CT scans, extracted 1132 radiomic features, and tested six ML models. Random Forest was optimal, validated via SHAP, ROC, and decision curve analysis.

Result: Random Forest model showed training AUC of 1.00 and testing AUC of 0.96, with significant feature associations (P < 0.05).

Conclusion: The model is a promising intelligent tool for EC diagnosis, combining high performance with clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Aimed to develop and validate a CT radiomics-based explainable machine
learning model for diagnosing malignancy and benignity specifically in
endometrial cancer (EC) patients. A total of 83 EC patients from two centers,
including 46 with malignant and 37 with benign conditions, were included, with
data split into a training set (n=59) and a testing set (n=24). The regions of
interest (ROIs) were manually segmented from pre-surgical CT scans, and 1132
radiomic features were extracted from the pre-surgical CT scans using
Pyradiomics. Six explainable machine learning modeling algorithms were
implemented respectively, for determining the optimal radiomics pipeline. The
diagnostic performance of the radiomic model was evaluated by using
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices,
and ROC curves. To enhance clinical understanding and usability, we separately
implemented SHAP analysis and feature mapping visualization, and evaluated the
calibration curve and decision curve. By comparing six modeling strategies, the
Random Forest model emerged as the optimal choice for diagnosing EC, with a
training AUC of 1.00 and a testing AUC of 0.96. SHAP identified the most
important radiomic features, revealing that all selected features were
significantly associated with EC (P < 0.05). Radiomics feature maps also
provide a feasible assessment tool for clinical applications. DCA indicated a
higher net benefit for our model compared to the "All" and "None" strategies,
suggesting its clinical utility in identifying high-risk cases and reducing
unnecessary interventions. In conclusion, the CT radiomics-based explainable
machine learning model achieved high diagnostic performance, which could be
used as an intelligent auxiliary tool for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboTwin 2.0 is a scalable simulation framework for generating diverse, realistic synthetic data for bimanual manipulation, improving sim-to-real transfer and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing synthetic datasets are insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to inefficient data generation and oversimplified simulations.

Method: RoboTwin 2.0 uses a large-scale object library, MLLMs for task-level code generation, and structured domain randomization across five axes.

Result: Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and significant improvements in generalization (e.g., 367% relative improvement for fine-tuned models).

Conclusion: RoboTwin 2.0 enables scalable, robust bimanual manipulation research with strong sim-to-real generalization, supported by released tools and datasets.

Abstract: Simulation-based data synthesis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing real-world robotic manipulation. However, existing synthetic datasets
remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1)
the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and
(2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world
complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that
enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along
with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct
RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147
categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels.
Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that
combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop
refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve
sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization
along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language
instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We
instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot
embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert
trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success
and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model
fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%)
on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our
synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization
without real-world supervision. We release the data generator, benchmark,
dataset, and code to support scalable research in robust bimanual manipulation.

TL;DR: ARNA is a general-purpose navigation framework using LVLMs for robust, autonomous navigation in unmapped environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems lack generalizability due to task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows. LVLMs offer human-like knowledge but prior integrations rely on pre-mapped spaces and hard-coded representations.

Method: ARNA equips an LVLM-based agent with perception, reasoning, and navigation tools, enabling autonomous task-specific workflows at runtime.

Result: ARNA achieves state-of-the-art performance in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, excelling in exploration, navigation, and embodied question answering.

Conclusion: ARNA provides a novel approach to robotic stack design, enabling robust navigation and reasoning without pre-existing maps or fixed representations.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments
remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on
task-specific neural networks and fixed data flows, limiting generalizability.
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding
human-like knowledge suitable for reasoning and planning. Yet, prior LVLM-robot
integrations typically depend on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations,
and myopic exploration. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation
Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose navigation framework that equips an
LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools
available within modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously
defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query the robotic
modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select appropriate navigation
actions. This approach enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously
unmapped environments, providing a new perspective on robotic stack design.
Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating effective exploration, navigation,
and embodied question answering without relying on handcrafted plans, fixed
input representations, or pre-existing maps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-enabled robots rely on cloud-hosted models, which are impractical in environments with poor communication. PRISM addresses this by enabling on-device SLMs.

Method: PRISM synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, uses LLM-generated plans to create a synthetic dataset, and distills a compact SLM as a replacement.

Result: PRISM boosts performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% to over 93% of GPT-4o's level, with generalization across robotic platforms and environments.

Conclusion: PRISM enables efficient, on-device robotic planning with SLMs, overcoming cloud dependency and improving performance significantly.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) provide robots with powerful contextual
reasoning abilities and a natural human interface. Yet, current LLM-enabled
robots typically depend on cloud-hosted models, limiting their usability in
environments with unreliable communication infrastructure, such as outdoor or
industrial settings. We present PRISM, a framework for distilling small
language model (SLM)-enabled robot planners that run on-device with minimal
human supervision. Starting from an existing LLM-enabled planner, PRISM
automatically synthesizes diverse tasks and environments, elicits plans from
the LLM, and uses this synthetic dataset to distill a compact SLM as a drop-in
replacement of the source model. We apply PRISM to three LLM-enabled planners
for mapping and exploration, manipulation, and household assistance, and we
demonstrate that PRISM improves the performance of Llama-3.2-3B from 10-20% of
GPT-4o's performance to over 93% - using only synthetic data. We further
demonstrate that the distilled planners generalize across heterogeneous robotic
platforms (ground and aerial) and diverse environments (indoor and outdoor). We

Motivation: Enable safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrains for robotic space exploration, addressing the lack of safety guarantees in current generative-AI methods.

Method: Proposes a dual-system framework: System-1 (fast, learned) and System-2 (slow, physics-based), coupled for adaptability and safety. Tested at NASA JPL's Mars Yard.

Result: Reduces failure rates by up to 4x while maintaining goal-reaching performance, leveraging inference-time compute.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances adaptability and safety, proving effective in real-world Mars-analog conditions.

Abstract: Safe, reliable navigation in extreme, unfamiliar terrain is required for
future robotic space exploration missions. Recent generative-AI methods learn
semantically aware navigation policies from large, cross-embodiment datasets,
but offer limited safety guarantees. Inspired by human cognitive science, we
propose a risk-guided diffusion framework that fuses a fast, learned "System-1"
with a slow, physics-based "System-2", sharing computation at both training and
inference to couple adaptability with formal safety. Hardware experiments
conducted at the NASA JPL's Mars-analog facility, Mars Yard, show that our
approach reduces failure rates by up to $4\times$ while matching the
goal-reaching performance of learning-based robotic models by leveraging
inference-time compute without any additional training.

Result: Achieves 8x memory reduction and 2.3x throughput improvement without compromising task success rates.

Conclusion: RLRC outperforms existing compression methods, enabling efficient on-device VLA deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However,
their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant
challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing human-like facial expressions in robotic heads by improving the automatic learning of such expressions.

Method: Uses 3D landmarks and their pairwise distances as input for learning, replacing facial action units. Applied to a different robot head than the original study.

Result: Survey participants preferred the proposed mappings in most cases, though further improvements are needed.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise but requires refinement for broader applicability.

Abstract: The ability to display rich facial expressions is crucial for human-like
robotic heads. While manually defining such expressions is intricate, there
already exist approaches to automatically learn them. In this work one such
approach is applied to evaluate and control a robot head different from the one
in the original study. To improve the mapping of facial expressions from human
actors onto a robot head, it is proposed to use 3D landmarks and their pairwise
distances as input to the learning algorithm instead of the previously used
facial action units. Participants of an online survey preferred mappings from
our proposed approach in most cases, though there are still further
improvements required.

Motivation: Ensuring robustness of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in unstructured real-world environments is challenging.

Method: Introduces RoboMonkey, a framework that samples actions, applies perturbations, and uses a VLM-based verifier to select optimal actions. A synthetic data pipeline trains verifiers.

Result: Significant performance gains: 25% improvement on out-of-distribution tasks, 8% on in-distribution tasks, and 7% when fine-tuning both VLAs and verifiers.

Conclusion: Test-time scaling and verification via RoboMonkey effectively enhance VLA robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in visuomotor control, yet ensuring their robustness in unstructured real-world
environments remains a persistent challenge. In this paper, we investigate
test-time scaling through the lens of sampling and verification as means to
enhance the robustness and generalization of VLAs. We first demonstrate that
the relationship between action error and the number of generated samples
follows an exponentiated power law across a range of VLAs, indicating the
existence of inference-time scaling laws. Building on these insights, we
introduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs. At deployment,
RoboMonkey samples a small set of actions from a VLA, applies Gaussian
perturbation and majority voting to construct an action proposal distribution,
and then uses a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based verifier to select the
optimal action. We propose a synthetic data generation pipeline for training
such VLM-based action verifiers, and demonstrate that scaling the synthetic
dataset consistently improves verification and downstream accuracy. Through
extensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing
VLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%
absolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 8% on in-distribution
tasks. Additionally, when adapting to new robot setups, we show that
fine-tuning both VLAs and action verifiers yields a 7% performance increase
compared to fine-tuning VLAs alone.

Result: Insights into mitigating the sim2real gap and improving docking controller robustness.

Conclusion: Highlights future research directions for marine robotics to enhance docking performance.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) docking in dynamic and uncertain
environments is a critical challenge for underwater robotics. Reinforcement
learning is a promising method for developing robust controllers, but the
disparity between training simulations and the real world, or the sim2real gap,
often leads to a significant deterioration in performance. In this work, we
perform a simulation study on reducing the sim2real gap in autonomous docking
through training various controllers and then evaluating them under realistic
disturbances. In particular, we focus on the real-world challenge of docking
under different payloads that are potentially outside the original training
distribution. We explore existing methods for improving robustness including
randomization techniques and history-conditioned controllers. Our findings
provide insights into mitigating the sim2real gap when training docking
controllers. Furthermore, our work indicates areas of future research that may

Motivation: Address the black-box nature of neural networks in safety-critical applications like Cobot grasping.

Method: Propose a pipeline combining grasping algorithm with explainable AI to extract and correlate learned features for safe tool handling.

Result: Demonstrated consistency and improved handover position in industrial tests.

Conclusion: The approach enhances transparency and reliability in Cobot grasping, validated in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Neural networks are often regarded as universal equations that can estimate
any function. This flexibility, however, comes with the drawback of high
complexity, rendering these networks into black box models, which is especially
relevant in safety-centric applications. To that end, we propose a pipeline for
a collaborative robot (Cobot) grasping algorithm that detects relevant tools
and generates the optimal grasp. To increase the transparency and reliability
of this approach, we integrate an explainable AI method that provides an
explanation for the underlying prediction of a model by extracting the learned
features and correlating them to corresponding classes from the input. These
concepts are then used as additional criteria to ensure the safe handling of
work tools. In this paper, we show the consistency of this approach and the
criterion for improving the handover position. This approach was tested in an
industrial environment, where a camera system was set up to enable a robot to
pick up certain tools and objects.

Method: The L1 KNODE-DW MPC framework combines adaptive learning and control to handle time-varying aerodynamic effects.

Result: The framework enables three-quadrotor teams to maintain vertical alignment in close proximity, outperforming baseline MPC methods.

Conclusion: The L1 adaptive module effectively compensates for unmodeled disturbances when paired with an accurate dynamics model.

Abstract: The task of flying in tight formations is challenging for teams of quadrotors
because the complex aerodynamic wake interactions can destabilize individual
team members as well as the team. Furthermore, these aerodynamic effects are
highly nonlinear and fast-paced, making them difficult to model and predict. To
overcome these challenges, we present L1 KNODE-DW MPC, an adaptive, mixed
expert learning based control framework that allows individual quadrotors to
accurately track trajectories while adapting to time-varying aerodynamic
interactions during formation flights. We evaluate L1 KNODE-DW MPC in two
different three-quadrotor formations and show that it outperforms several MPC
baselines. Our results show that the proposed framework is capable of enabling
the three-quadrotor team to remain vertically aligned in close proximity
throughout the flight. These findings show that the L1 adaptive module
compensates for unmodeled disturbances most effectively when paired with an
accurate dynamics model. A video showcasing our framework and the physical
experiments is available here: https://youtu.be/9QX1Q5Ut9Rs

### [579] [A workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR datasets in simulation environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17378)
*Abhishek Phadke,Shakib Mahmud Dipto,Pratip Rana*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A simulation workflow for synthetic LiDAR datasets is presented, supporting autonomous vehicle perception and sensor security analysis. It uses CoppeliaSim to generate multimodal datasets and examines LiDAR vulnerabilities.

Abstract: This paper presents a simulation workflow for generating synthetic LiDAR
datasets to support autonomous vehicle perception, robotics research, and
sensor security analysis. Leveraging the CoppeliaSim simulation environment and
its Python API, we integrate time-of-flight LiDAR, image sensors, and two
dimensional scanners onto a simulated vehicle platform operating within an
urban scenario. The workflow automates data capture, storage, and annotation
across multiple formats (PCD, PLY, CSV), producing synchronized multimodal
datasets with ground truth pose information. We validate the pipeline by
generating large-scale point clouds and corresponding RGB and depth imagery.
The study examines potential security vulnerabilities in LiDAR data, such as
adversarial point injection and spoofing attacks, and demonstrates how
synthetic datasets can facilitate the evaluation of defense strategies.
Finally, limitations related to environmental realism, sensor noise modeling,
and computational scalability are discussed, and future research directions,
such as incorporating weather effects, real-world terrain models, and advanced
scanner configurations, are proposed. The workflow provides a versatile,
reproducible framework for generating high-fidelity synthetic LiDAR datasets to
advance perception research and strengthen sensor security in autonomous
systems. Documentation and examples accompany this framework; samples of

*Zhou Chen,Sanjoy Kundu,Harsimran S. Baweja,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: EASE is a self-supervised framework for active event perception, using free energy minimization to unify representation learning and control without predefined actions or rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined actions and rewards, limiting adaptability in dynamic scenarios. EASE aims to overcome this by leveraging intrinsic signals.

Method: EASE combines generative perception and control policies, using prediction errors and entropy for event segmentation and tracking.

Result: EASE achieves privacy-preserving, scalable event perception in simulations and real-world tasks, showing adaptability and emergent behaviors.

Conclusion: EASE provides a robust, annotation-free solution for embodied systems in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Active event perception, the ability to dynamically detect, track, and
summarize events in real time, is essential for embodied intelligence in tasks
such as human-AI collaboration, assistive robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, existing approaches often depend on predefined action spaces,
annotated datasets, and extrinsic rewards, limiting their adaptability and
scalability in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Inspired by cognitive theories of
event perception and predictive coding, we propose EASE, a self-supervised
framework that unifies spatiotemporal representation learning and embodied
control through free energy minimization. EASE leverages prediction errors and
entropy as intrinsic signals to segment events, summarize observations, and
actively track salient actors, operating without explicit annotations or
external rewards. By coupling a generative perception model with an
action-driven control policy, EASE dynamically aligns predictions with
observations, enabling emergent behaviors such as implicit memory, target
continuity, and adaptability to novel environments. Extensive evaluations in
simulation and real-world settings demonstrate EASE's ability to achieve
privacy-preserving and scalable event perception, providing a robust foundation
for embodied systems in unscripted, dynamic tasks.

we introduce GeNIE (Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild
Environments), a robust navigation framework designed for global deployment.
GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2

ambiguous settings. We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at
ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three
continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible
score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire
competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new
benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release
the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support
future research in real-world navigation.

*Yongxin Shao,Binrui Wang,Aihong Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ADA-DPM is a LiDAR SLAM strategy that balances accuracy and robustness by filtering noise and dynamic points, using dynamic segmentation, global importance scoring, and multi-scale feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR SLAM methods struggle with trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in dynamic, noisy, or unstructured environments.

Method: Proposes ADA-DPM with Dynamic Segmentation Head for dynamic points, Global Importance Scoring Head for noise suppression, and GLI-GCN for multi-scale feature fusion.

Result: Tested on public datasets, ADA-DPM achieves outstanding performance in accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: ADA-DPM effectively addresses challenges in LiDAR SLAM, offering superior performance in dynamic and noisy environments.

Abstract: LiDAR SLAM has demonstrated significant application value in various fields,
including mobile robot navigation and high-precision map construction. However,
existing methods often need to make a trade-off between positioning accuracy
and system robustness when faced with dynamic object interference, point cloud
noise, and unstructured environments. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive noise filtering SLAM strategy-ADA-DPM, achieving excellent preference
in both aspects. We design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict the
category of feature points belonging to dynamic points, to eliminate dynamic
feature points; design the Global Importance Scoring Head to adaptively select
feature points with higher contribution and features while suppressing noise
interference; and construct the Cross Layer Intra-Graph Convolution Module
(GLI-GCN) to fuse multi-scale neighborhood structures, thereby enhancing the
discriminative ability of overlapping features. Finally, to further validate
the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on several publicly available
datasets and achieved outstanding results.

*Pratik Kunapuli,Jake Welde,Dinesh Jayaraman,Vijay Kumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper highlights challenges in fairly comparing RL and geometric controllers for quadrotor tasks, resolves biases in prior studies, and finds smaller performance gaps when comparisons are symmetric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address unreliable comparisons between RL and geometric controllers in quadrotor tasks, ensuring fair benchmarking.

Method: Develops best practices for synthesizing RL and geometric controllers, resolving asymmetries in task definition, datasets, and feedforward information.

Result: Geometric control has lower steady-state error, while RL excels in transient performance. Performance gaps are smaller than previously claimed.

Conclusion: Fair comparisons are critical; RL and geometric controllers have complementary strengths. Open-sourced implementations promote future development.

Abstract: Learning-based control approaches like reinforcement learning (RL) have
recently produced a slew of impressive results for tasks like quadrotor
trajectory tracking and drone racing. Naturally, it is common to demonstrate
the advantages of these new controllers against established methods like
analytical controllers. We observe, however, that reliably comparing the
performance of such very different classes of controllers is more complicated
than might appear at first sight. As a case study, we take up the problem of
agile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop
a set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric
controllers (GC) for benchmarking. In the process, we resolve widespread
RL-favoring biases in prior studies that provide asymmetric access to: (1) the
task definition, in the form of an objective function, (2) representative
datasets, for parameter optimization, and (3) feedforward information,
describing the desired future trajectory. The resulting findings are the
following: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned
and classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can
yield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,
but we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than
previously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric
control achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better
transient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or
less agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.
Finally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for
these aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.

*Andrea Testa,SÃ¸ren Hauberg,Tamim Asfour,Leonel Rozo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GCF), a framework using Riemannian and Contact geometry to model complex dynamical systems with force exchange and dissipation, ensuring stability and energy conservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate modeling of complex dynamical systems, especially those with force exchange and dissipation, is challenging but essential for applications like fluid dynamics and robotics.

Method: GCF uses Riemannian and Contact geometry to create a latent contact Hamiltonian model, adapted to target dynamics via an ensemble of contactomorphisms, preserving stability and energy properties.

Result: Experiments show GCF effectively learns dynamics for physical systems and controls robots in interaction tasks, with robust generalization to unseen scenarios.

Conclusion: GCF provides a novel, geometry-based approach for modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, demonstrating practical effectiveness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly
those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications
ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges
due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer.
This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework
leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such
systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable
properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of
contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while
preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware
geodesics that attract the system's behavior toward the data support, enabling
robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on
learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on
interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Yang Lyu,Zhenghao Zou,Yanfeng Li,Chunhui Zhao,Quan Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper proposes an IMU-free, feature-association-free framework for agile robot ego-motion velocity estimation using event cameras and millimeter wave radar, ensuring robustness and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable ego-motion estimation for agile robots is challenging due to sensor limitations like measurement blurring and delays in dynamic scenarios.

Method: Combines event camera and radar data to derive velocities directly, avoiding complex feature associations, and uses a continuous-time state-space model for fusion.

Result: The framework achieves reliable and efficient velocity estimation in challenging environments, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust, computationally efficient, and suitable for edge computing in dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving reliable ego motion estimation for agile robots, e.g., aerobatic
aircraft, remains challenging because most robot sensors fail to respond timely
and clearly to highly dynamic robot motions, often resulting in measurement
blurring, distortion, and delays. In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and
feature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity
estimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two
types of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,
First, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive
rotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated
association process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more
robust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more
computationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we
propose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and
event-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged
smoother fashion. In the end, we validate our velometer framework extensively
in self-collected experiment datasets. The results indicate that our IMU-free
and association-free ego motion estimation framework can achieve reliable and
efficient velocity output in challenging environments. The source code,

*Minh Trinh,Andreas RenÃ© Geist,Josefine Monnet,Stefan Vilceanu,Sebastian Trimpe,Christian Brecher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper compares Newtonian and Lagrangian neural networks for inverse dynamics in robots, finding Newtonian networks superior when estimating motor torques due to their explicit modeling of dissipative torques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate inverse dynamics models are crucial for controlling industrial robots, but there's no clear guidance on choosing between Newtonian and Lagrangian neural networks.

Method: The study combines neural network regression with inverse dynamics formulations (Newton-Euler and Euler-Lagrange equations) and tests them on a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.

Result: Newtonian networks outperform Lagrangian networks when motor torques are estimated, as the latter do not explicitly model dissipative torques.

Conclusion: Newtonian neural networks are more effective for inverse dynamics in scenarios involving motor torque estimation.

Abstract: Accurate inverse dynamics models are essential tools for controlling
industrial robots. Recent research combines neural network regression with
inverse dynamics formulations of the Newton-Euler and the Euler-Lagrange
equations of motion, resulting in so-called Newtonian neural networks and
Lagrangian neural networks, respectively. These physics-informed models seek to
identify unknowns in the analytical equations from data. Despite their
potential, current literature lacks guidance on choosing between Lagrangian and
Newtonian networks. In this study, we show that when motor torques are
estimated instead of directly measuring joint torques, Lagrangian networks
prove less effective compared to Newtonian networks as they do not explicitly
model dissipative torques. The performance of these models is compared to
neural network regression on data of a MABI MAX 100 industrial robot.

*Anirban Ghosh,Ian Dahlin,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TDACloud uses Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for local descriptor extraction from point clouds, achieving high recognition accuracy without GPU-based training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in point cloud-based object/place recognition, especially under noise or transformations.

Method: Utilizes ATOL vectorization to generate fixed-size TDA-descriptor vectors from raw point clouds.

Result: Achieves high accuracy in noisy conditions and outperforms baselines by up to 14%.

Conclusion: TDACloud is effective for robust object/place recognition in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in
applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and
localization. Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud
that can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a
challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has
been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we
propose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis
(TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need
resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we
used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike
voxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and
outputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed
TDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford
RobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for
object and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and
transformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated,
or rotated. Our results demonstrate high recognition accuracies in noisy
conditions and large-scale real-world place recognition while outperforming the
baselines by up to approximately 14%.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces an emulator-based methodology using the BorealHDR dataset to benchmark Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods offline, achieving high accuracy (RMSE <1.78%) and concluding that classical AE methods perform best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard datasets limit reproducibility for AE methods due to fixed sensor inputs. The paper addresses this by proposing an offline benchmarking approach.

Method: Uses an emulator with the BorealHDR dataset to generate images at any exposure time, leveraging multi-exposure stereo data and lidar-inertial-odometry maps.

Result: Emulated images achieve RMSE below 1.78% compared to ground truth. Benchmarking shows classical AE methods outperform others.

Conclusion: The offline approach enables reproducible benchmarking, with classical AE methods remaining superior. The dataset and code are publicly shared.

Abstract: Standard datasets often present limitations, particularly due to the fixed
nature of input data sensors, which makes it difficult to compare methods that
actively adjust sensor parameters to suit environmental conditions. This is the
case with Automatic-Exposure (AE) methods, which rely on environmental factors
to influence the image acquisition process. As a result, AE methods have
traditionally been benchmarked in an online manner, rendering experiments
non-reproducible. Building on our prior work, we propose a methodology that
utilizes an emulator capable of generating images at any exposure time. This
approach leverages BorealHDR, a unique multi-exposure stereo dataset, along
with its new extension, in which data was acquired along a repeated trajectory
at different times of the day to assess the impact of changing illumination. In
total, BorealHDR covers 13.4 km over 59 trajectories in challenging lighting
conditions. The dataset also includes lidar-inertial-odometry-based maps with
pose estimation for each image frame, as well as Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) data for comparison. We demonstrate that by using images acquired
at various exposure times, we can emulate realistic images with a
Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) below 1.78% compared to ground truth images.
Using this offline approach, we benchmarked eight AE methods, concluding that
the classical AE method remains the field's best performer. To further support
reproducibility, we provide in-depth details on the development of our backpack
acquisition platform, including hardware, electrical components, and
performance specifications. Additionally, we share valuable lessons learned
from deploying the backpack over more than 25 km across various environments.

TL;DR: GRAND-SLAM is a multi-agent Gaussian splatting SLAM method for large-scale outdoor environments, outperforming existing methods in tracking and rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian SLAM methods are limited to small-scale indoor environments, leaving large-scale outdoor multi-agent scenarios unexplored.

Method: GRAND-SLAM integrates implicit tracking via local submap optimization and inter-/intra-robot loop closure in a pose-graph framework.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 28% higher PSNR on Replica, and 91% lower tracking error on Kimera-Multi.

Conclusion: GRAND-SLAM advances multi-agent Gaussian SLAM for large-scale outdoor use with superior performance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for
RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor
environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising
approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering
scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to
small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian
Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative
Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module
based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and
intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework.
Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance
and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as
well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over
existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.

TL;DR: RoboArena introduces a crowd-sourced, scalable method for evaluating generalist robot policies by aggregating pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and environments, outperforming traditional centralized approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot benchmarking methods are limited by standardization and lack scalability for evaluating generalist policies across varied tasks and environments.

Method: RoboArena crowd-sources evaluations via a distributed network of evaluators who perform double-blind pairwise comparisons of policies in freely chosen tasks and environments.

Result: Over 600 real-robot evaluations showed RoboArena provides more accurate policy rankings than centralized methods, with improved scalability, resilience, and trustworthiness.

Conclusion: RoboArena offers a scalable, reliable, and community-accessible framework for evaluating generalist robot policies, advancing the field beyond traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Comprehensive, unbiased, and comparable evaluation of modern generalist
policies is uniquely challenging: existing approaches for robot benchmarking
typically rely on heavy standardization, either by specifying fixed evaluation
tasks and environments, or by hosting centralized ''robot challenges'', and do
not readily scale to evaluating generalist policies across a broad range of
tasks and environments. In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for
scalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of
standardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we
propose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.
Importantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they
evaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to
perform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating
preference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and
environments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach
across a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID
robot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes
across seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced
approach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist
policies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more
scalable, resilient, and trustworthy. We open our evaluation network to the
community and hope that it can enable more accessible comparisons of generalist
robot policies.

TL;DR: H-GRAIL is a hierarchical architecture for autonomous agents, addressing open-ended learning challenges like goal generation, skill acquisition, and adaptation in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developing agents for real-world settings requires handling changing task structures and non-stationary environments, which existing works often address in isolation.

Method: H-GRAIL uses intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning mechanisms to autonomously generate goals, learn skills, and adapt to changes.

Result: Tested in a robotic scenario, H-GRAIL effectively tackles open-ended learning challenges.

Conclusion: H-GRAIL provides an integrated solution for autonomous agents in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Developing agents capable of autonomously interacting with complex and
dynamic environments, where task structures may change over time and prior
knowledge cannot be relied upon, is a key prerequisite for deploying artificial
systems in real-world settings. The open-ended learning framework identifies
the core challenges for creating such agents, including the ability to
autonomously generate new goals, acquire the necessary skills (or curricula of
skills) to achieve them, and adapt to non-stationary environments. While many
existing works tackles various aspects of these challenges in isolation, few
propose integrated solutions that address them simultaneously. In this paper,
we introduce H-GRAIL, a hierarchical architecture that, through the use of
different typologies of intrinsic motivations and interconnected learning
mechanisms, autonomously discovers new goals, learns the required skills for
their achievement, generates skill sequences for tackling interdependent tasks,
and adapts to non-stationary environments. We tested H-GRAIL in a real robotic
scenario, demonstrating how the proposed solutions effectively address the
various challenges of open-ended learning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study explores Learning-by-Teaching (LbT) using autonomous social robots in classrooms, introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) for real-time learning. Results show higher retention gains for children teaching robots, especially in grammar tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how real-time, interactive learning can be supported by autonomous social robots in classrooms, moving beyond scripted or Wizard-of-Oz behaviors.

Method: Conducted two experiments with 58 primary school children, comparing teaching a robot (using Interactive RL) to self-practice on tablets for learning French vocabulary and grammar.

Result: Children in the LbT condition showed significantly higher retention gains, especially in grammar. Lower prior knowledge learners benefited most. Behavioral metrics indicated adaptive teaching strategies and deeper engagement.

Conclusion: Interactive RL is effective for peer-robot learning, and deploying multiple autonomous robots in classrooms is feasible. Robots enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning outcomes.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in Learning-by-Teaching (LbT), few studies have
explored how this paradigm can be implemented with autonomous, peer-like social
robots in real classrooms. Most prior work has relied on scripted or
Wizard-of-Oz behaviors, limiting our understanding of how real-time,
interactive learning can be supported by artificial agents. This study
addresses this gap by introducing Interactive Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a
cognitive model for teachable social robots. We conducted two between-subject
experiments with 58 primary school children, who either taught a robot or
practiced independently on a tablet while learning French vocabulary
(memorization) and grammatical rules (inference). The robot, powered by
Interactive RL, learned from the child's evaluative feedback. Children in the
LbT condition achieved significantly higher retention gains compared to those
in the self-practice condition, especially on the grammar task. Learners with
lower prior knowledge benefited most from teaching the robot. Behavioural
metrics revealed that children adapted their teaching strategies over time and
engaged more deeply during inference tasks. This work makes two contributions:
(1) it introduces Interactive RL as a pedagogically effective and scalable
model for peer-robot learning, and (2) it demonstrates, for the first time, the
feasibility of deploying multiple autonomous robots simultaneously in real
classrooms. These findings extend theoretical understanding of LbT by showing
that social robots can function not only as passive tutees but as adaptive
partners that enhance meta-cognitive engagement and long-term learning
outcomes.

Method: PSNs learn a symplectification lift via Dirac structures, embedding constrained systems into higher-dimensional manifolds. A recurrent encoder and flow-matching objective are used, followed by a Symplectic Network (SympNet) for constrained trajectory forecasting.

Result: The method is demonstrated on the ANYmal quadruped robot, successfully preserving energy, momentum, and constraints in a contact-rich system.

Conclusion: PSNs bridge constrained, dissipative systems with symplectic learning, enabling new geometric machine learning models grounded in first principles.

Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has achieved remarkable progress by embedding
geometric priors, such as Hamiltonian symmetries and variational principles,
into neural networks, enabling structure-preserving models that extrapolate
with high accuracy. However, in systems with dissipation and holonomic
constraints, ubiquitous in legged locomotion and multibody robotics, the
canonical symplectic form becomes degenerate, undermining the very invariants
that guarantee stability and long-term prediction. In this work, we tackle this
foundational limitation by introducing Presymplectification Networks (PSNs),
the first framework to learn the symplectification lift via Dirac structures,
restoring a non-degenerate symplectic geometry by embedding constrained systems
into a higher-dimensional manifold. Our architecture combines a recurrent
encoder with a flow-matching objective to learn the augmented phase-space
dynamics end-to-end. We then attach a lightweight Symplectic Network (SympNet)
to forecast constrained trajectories while preserving energy, momentum, and
constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate our method on the dynamics of the
ANYmal quadruped robot, a challenging contact-rich, multibody system. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that effectively bridges the
gap between constrained, dissipative mechanical systems and symplectic
learning, unlocking a whole new class of geometric machine learning models,
grounded in first principles yet adaptable from data.

*Alessandro Saviolo,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NOVA is an onboard, object-centric framework for autonomous aerial target tracking in GPS-denied environments using stereo cameras and IMU, achieving high-speed performance without external aids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on motion capture or pre-mapped scenes, limiting real-world deployment. NOVA aims to enable robust tracking in unstructured environments without these dependencies.

Method: NOVA combines lightweight object detection, stereo depth completion, histogram-based filtering, visual-inertial state estimation, and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) with high-order control barrier functions for obstacle avoidance.

Result: NOVA successfully tracks targets at speeds over 50 km/h in challenging scenarios like urban mazes and forests, showing resilience to GPS loss and lighting changes.

Conclusion: NOVA demonstrates that high-speed vision-based tracking is feasible in unstructured environments using only onboard sensors, eliminating reliance on external systems.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial target tracking in unstructured and GPS-denied environments
remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Many existing methods rely on
motion capture systems, pre-mapped scenes, or feature-based localization to
ensure safety and control, limiting their deployment in real-world conditions.
We introduce NOVA, a fully onboard, object-centric framework that enables
robust target tracking and collision-aware navigation using only a stereo
camera and an IMU. Rather than constructing a global map or relying on absolute
localization, NOVA formulates perception, estimation, and control entirely in
the target's reference frame. A tightly integrated stack combines a lightweight
object detector with stereo depth completion, followed by histogram-based
filtering to infer robust target distances under occlusion and noise. These
measurements feed a visual-inertial state estimator that recovers the full
6-DoF pose of the robot relative to the target. A nonlinear model predictive
controller (NMPC) plans dynamically feasible trajectories in the target frame.
To ensure safety, high-order control barrier functions are constructed online
from a compact set of high-risk collision points extracted from depth, enabling
real-time obstacle avoidance without maps or dense representations. We validate
NOVA across challenging real-world scenarios, including urban mazes, forest
trails, and repeated transitions through buildings with intermittent GPS loss
and severe lighting changes that disrupt feature-based localization. Each
experiment is repeated multiple times under similar conditions to assess
resilience, showing consistent and reliable performance. NOVA achieves agile
target following at speeds exceeding 50 km/h. These results show that
high-speed vision-based tracking is possible in the wild using only onboard
sensing, with no reliance on external localization or environment assumptions.

### [595] [MinD: Unified Visual Imagination and Control via Hierarchical World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18897)
*Xiaowei Chi,Kuangzhi Ge,Jiaming Liu,Siyuan Zhou,Peidong Jia,Zichen He,Yuzhen Liu,Tingguang Li,Lei Han,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MinD is a hierarchical diffusion-based framework for video generation models (VGMs) in robotics, addressing slow generation speed and poor video-action consistency. It uses a dual-system design and a novel co-training strategy to enable real-time interaction and coherent visual guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGMs are limited by slow generation speed and inconsistency between imagined videos and executable actions, hindering real-time robotics applications.

Method: MinD employs a dual-system design with low-frequency VGM for video prediction and high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction. It introduces DiffMatcher for video-action alignment and a co-training strategy with separate schedulers.

Result: MinD achieves state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench and functions as a reliable world simulator for task prediction.

Conclusion: MinD advances unified world modeling in robotics by improving real-time interaction and video-action consistency, with potential for preemptive task evaluation.

Abstract: Video generation models (VGMs) offer a promising pathway for unified world
modeling in robotics by integrating simulation, prediction, and manipulation.
However, their practical application remains limited due to (1) slowgeneration
speed, which limits real-time interaction, and (2) poor consistency between
imagined videos and executable actions. To address these challenges, we propose
Manipulate in Dream (MinD), a hierarchical diffusion-based world model
framework that employs a dual-system design for vision-language manipulation.
MinD executes VGM at low frequencies to extract video prediction features,
while leveraging a high-frequency diffusion policy for real-time interaction.
This architecture enables low-latency, closed-loop control in manipulation with
coherent visual guidance. To better coordinate the two systems, we introduce a
video-action diffusion matching module (DiffMatcher), with a novel co-training
strategy that uses separate schedulers for each diffusion model. Specifically,
we introduce a diffusion-forcing mechanism to DiffMatcher that aligns their
intermediate representations during training, helping the fast action model
better understand video-based predictions. Beyond manipulation, MinD also
functions as a world simulator, reliably predicting task success or failure in
latent space before execution. Trustworthy analysis further shows that VGMs can
preemptively evaluate task feasibility and mitigate risks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MinD achieves
state-of-the-art manipulation (63%+) in RL-Bench, advancing the frontier of
unified world modeling in robotics.

### [596] [Bayesian Inference for Left-Truncated Log-Logistic Distributions for Time-to-event Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17852)
*Fahad Mostafa,Md Rejuan Haque,Md Mostafijur Rahman,Farzana Nasrin*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Bayesian method for estimating parameters of the left-truncated log-logistic (LTLL) distribution, demonstrating its robustness and reliability in handling truncated time-to-event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parameter estimation in truncated distributions is challenging, especially for time-to-event data. Bayesian methods offer probabilistic inference and uncertainty quantification, which are crucial for small or truncated samples.

Method: A Bayesian approach is used with independent priors for LTLL parameters. Posterior inference is done via Metropolis-Hastings MCMC sampling to estimate scale (Î±) and shape (Î²) parameters.

Result: Bayesian estimation provides stable and reliable parameter estimates, outperforming traditional methods, especially with irregular likelihood surfaces due to truncation.

Conclusion: Bayesian inference is advantageous for parameter estimation in truncated distributions, offering robust uncertainty quantification for time-to-event data analysis.

Abstract: Parameter estimation is a foundational step in statistical modeling, enabling
us to extract knowledge from data and apply it effectively. Bayesian estimation
of parameters incorporates prior beliefs with observed data to infer
distribution parameters probabilistically and robustly. Moreover, it provides
full posterior distributions, allowing uncertainty quantification and
regularization, especially useful in small or truncated samples. Utilizing the
left-truncated log-logistic (LTLL) distribution is particularly well-suited for
modeling time-to-event data where observations are subject to a known lower
bound such as precipitation data and cancer survival times. In this paper, we
propose a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the LTLL
distribution with a fixed truncation point \( x_L > 0 \). Given a random
variable \( X \sim LL(\alpha, \beta; x_L) \), where \( \alpha > 0 \) is the
scale parameter and \( \beta > 0 \) is the shape parameter, the likelihood
function is derived based on a truncated sample \( X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N \) with
\( X_i > x_L \). We assume independent prior distributions for the parameters,
and the posterior inference is conducted via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling,
specifically using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain posterior
estimates \( \hat{\alpha} \) and \( \hat{\beta} \). Through simulation studies
and real-world applications, we demonstrate that Bayesian estimation provides
more stable and reliable parameter estimates, particularly when the likelihood
surface is irregular due to left truncation. The results highlight the
advantages of Bayesian inference outperform the estimation of parameter
uncertainty in truncated distributions for time to event data analysis.

*Shu Yu Tew,Daniel F. Schmidt,Mario Boley*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: GRASP is a Bayesian framework using the NBP prior for grouped regression, offering adaptive sparsity and efficient hyperparameter estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify grouped regression by directly controlling tail behavior of the NBP prior, avoiding complex hierarchies.

Method: Assigns NBP prior to local and group shrinkage parameters, quantifies within-group correlations, and uses a Metropolis-Hastings sampler.

Result: Demonstrates robustness and versatility in grouped regression across varying sparsity and signal-to-noise ratios.

Conclusion: GRASP provides a flexible, efficient solution for grouped regression with adaptive sparsity.

Abstract: We introduce GRASP, a simple Bayesian framework for regression with grouped
predictors, built on the normal beta prime (NBP) prior. The NBP prior is an
adaptive generalization of the horseshoe prior with tunable hyperparameters
that control tail behavior, enabling a flexible range of sparsity, from strong
shrinkage to ridge-like regularization. Unlike prior work that introduced the
group inverse-gamma gamma (GIGG) prior by decomposing the NBP prior into
structured hierarchies, we show that directly controlling the tails is
sufficient without requiring complex hierarchical constructions. Extending the
non-tail adaptive grouped half-Cauchy hierarchy of Xu et al., GRASP assigns the
NBP prior to both local and group shrinkage parameters allowing adaptive
sparsity within and across groups. A key contribution of this work is a novel
framework to explicitly quantify correlations among shrinkage parameters within
a group, providing deeper insights into grouped shrinkage behavior. We also
introduce an efficient Metropolis-Hastings sampler for hyperparameter
estimation. Empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate the
robustness and versatility of GRASP across grouped regression problems with
varying sparsity and signal-to-noise ratios.

*Alexandre Le Nepvou*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: A novel modal logic framework, Stratified Actualization Logic (SAL), replaces traditional possible worlds with stratified actualization, focusing on local, dynamic processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Kripke semantics overlook the dynamic and asymmetric nature of actualization processes, prompting the need for a more nuanced approach.

Method: Develops SAL with modalities indexed by ontological stability levels, defining syntax, semantics, axioms, and proving soundness/completeness.

Result: SAL captures ontological structure without abstract possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to modal realism.

Conclusion: SAL provides a dynamic, locally grounded framework for modal logic, applicable to temporal becoming, quantum decoherence, and metaphysics.

Abstract: This article develops a novel framework for modal logic based on the idea of
stratified actualization, rather than the classical model of global possible
worlds. Traditional Kripke semantics treat modal operators as quantification
over fully determinate alternatives, neglecting the local, dynamic, and often
asymmetric nature of actualization processes. We propose a system Stratified
Actualization Logic (SAL) in which modalities are indexed by levels of
ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. Each modality
operates over a structured layer of possibility, grounded in the internal
coherence of transitions between layers. We formally define the syntax and
semantics of SAL, introduce its axioms, and prove soundness and completeness.
Applications are discussed in connection with temporal becoming, quantum
decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics. The result is a logic that captures
the ontological structure of actualization without recourse to abstract
possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.

*Hao Peng,Steve Jiang,Robert Timmerman*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces PULSAR and DDIM to improve adaptive radiotherapy by predicting tumor evolution and treatment response, showing promising results for personalized care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variability in dose and timing for brain cancer treatment complicates response prediction, necessitating better predictive tools.

Method: Uses Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to simulate tumor evolution and response, comparing single-step and iterative denoising strategies.

Result: DDIM effectively models tumor evolution and localizes treatment response regions, improving adaptive interventions.

Conclusion: The framework enhances personalized radiotherapy by addressing spatial and temporal tumor response patterns, enabling early adaptive decisions.

Abstract: Radiation therapy outcomes are decided by two key parameters, dose and
timing, whose best values vary substantially across patients. This variability
is especially critical in the treatment of brain cancer, where fractionated or
staged stereotactic radiosurgery improves safety compared to single fraction
approaches, but complicates the ability to predict treatment response. To
address this challenge, we employ Personalized Ultra-fractionated Stereotactic
Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), a strategy that dynamically adjusts treatment
based on how each tumor evolves over time. However, the success of PULSAR and
other adaptive approaches depends on predictive tools that can guide early
treatment decisions and avoid both overtreatment and undertreatment. However,
current radiomics and dosiomics models offer limited insight into the evolving
spatial and temporal patterns of tumor response. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel framework using Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM),
which learns data-driven mappings from pre to post treatment imaging. In this
study, we developed single step and iterative denoising strategies and compared
their performance. The results show that diffusion models can effectively
simulate patient specific tumor evolution and localize regions associated with
treatment response. The proposed strategy provides a promising foundation for
modeling heterogeneous treatment response and enabling early, adaptive
interventions, paving the way toward more personalized and biologically
informed radiotherapy.

TL;DR: The study compares three methods (radiomics, gradient-based features, and CNN with CAM) for predicting brain metastasis treatment response, finding pixel-wise CAM most effective for spatial insights and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized radiation therapy by identifying spatially informative features and adapting treatment based on individual response.

Method: Analyzed 69 brain metastases using an autoencoder classifier to predict tumor shrinkage (>20%) at 3 months, comparing radiomics, gradient-based features, and CNN with CAM.

Result: Pixel-wise CAM outperformed others in accuracy and spatial detail, identifying lesion-specific regions and potential radio-resistant areas.

Conclusion: Pixel-wise CAM shows promise for guiding personalized radiotherapy, though further validation is needed.

Abstract: Personalized precision radiation therapy requires more than simple
classification, it demands the identification of prognostic, spatially
informative features and the ability to adapt treatment based on individual
response. This study compares three approaches for predicting treatment
response: standard radiomics, gradient based features, and convolutional neural
networks enhanced with Class Activation Mapping. We analyzed 69 brain
metastases from 39 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery. An
integrated autoencoder classifier model was used to predict whether tumor
volume would shrink by more than 20 percent at a three months follow up, framed
as a binary classification task. The results highlight their strength in
hierarchical feature extraction and the classifiers discriminative capacity.
Among the models, pixel wise CAM provides the most detailed spatial insight,
identifying lesion specific regions rather than relying on fixed patterns,
demonstrating strong generalization. In non responding lesions, the activated
regions may indicate areas of radio resistance. Pixel wise CAM outperformed
both radiomics and gradient based methods in classification accuracy. Moreover,
its fine grained spatial features allow for alignment with cellular level data,
supporting biological validation and deeper understanding of heterogeneous
treatment responses. Although further validation is necessary, these findings
underscore the promise in guiding personalized and adaptive radiotherapy
strategies for both photon and particle therapies.

TL;DR: Quantum Hybrid Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) outperform classical methods in anomaly detection for Industrial Control Systems, showing higher F1 scores and better kernel-target alignment with minimal noise impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cyberphysical security by leveraging quantum computing for more effective anomaly detection in critical infrastructures.

Method: Parameterization of QSVMs using datasets from Cyber-Physical Systems, with noise simulations based on real IBMQ hardware.

Result: QSVMs achieve 13.3% higher F1 scores, 91.023% better kernel-target alignment, and only 0.98% maximum error under noise.

Conclusion: QSVMs offer a significant advantage in anomaly detection for ICS, improving security and integrity of critical infrastructures.

Abstract: Sensitive data captured by Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play a large role
in the safety and integrity of many critical infrastructures. Detection of
anomalous or malicious data, or Anomaly Detection (AD), with machine learning
is one of many vital components of cyberphysical security. Quantum kernel-based
machine learning methods have shown promise in identifying complex anomalous
behavior by leveraging the highly expressive and efficient feature spaces of
quantum computing. This study focuses on the parameterization of Quantum Hybrid
Support Vector Machines (QSVMs) using three popular datasets from
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The results demonstrate that QSVMs outperform
traditional classical kernel methods, achieving 13.3% higher F1 scores.
Additionally, this research investigates noise using simulations based on real
IBMQ hardware, revealing a maximum error of only 0.98% in the QSVM kernels.
This error results in an average reduction of 1.57% in classification metrics.
Furthermore, the study found that QSVMs show a 91.023% improvement in
kernel-target alignment compared to classical methods, indicating a potential
"quantum advantage" in anomaly detection for critical infrastructures. This
effort suggests that QSVMs can provide a substantial advantage in anomaly
detection for ICS, ultimately enhancing the security and integrity of critical
infrastructures.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Sleek, a step-by-step reasoning-based black-box attack that exposes failures in existing unlearning methods for LLMs, showing that erased knowledge can still be retrieved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of current unlearning techniques in LLMs, which often leave knowledge retrievable, and to highlight the risks of information leakage.

Method: A structured attack framework with adversarial prompt generation, an attack mechanism to recall erased content, and categorization of prompts to exploit unlearning weaknesses.

Result: Existing unlearning methods fail to reliably remove knowledge; 62.5% of adversarial prompts retrieved forgotten facts, and 50% exposed unfair suppression of retained knowledge.

Conclusion: Current unlearning strategies are insufficient, necessitating more robust methods to ensure reliable knowledge erasure in LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge erasure in large language models (LLMs) is important for ensuring
compliance with data and AI regulations, safeguarding user privacy, mitigating
bias, and misinformation. Existing unlearning methods aim to make the process
of knowledge erasure more efficient and effective by removing specific
knowledge while preserving overall model performance, especially for retained
information. However, it has been observed that the unlearning techniques tend
to suppress and leave the knowledge beneath the surface, thus making it
retrievable with the right prompts. In this work, we demonstrate that
\textit{step-by-step reasoning} can serve as a backdoor to recover this hidden
information. We introduce a step-by-step reasoning-based black-box attack,
Sleek, that systematically exposes unlearning failures. We employ a structured
attack framework with three core components: (1) an adversarial prompt
generation strategy leveraging step-by-step reasoning built from LLM-generated
queries, (2) an attack mechanism that successfully recalls erased content, and
exposes unfair suppression of knowledge intended for retention and (3) a
categorization of prompts as direct, indirect, and implied, to identify which
query types most effectively exploit unlearning weaknesses. Through extensive
evaluations on four state-of-the-art unlearning techniques and two widely used
LLMs, we show that existing approaches fail to ensure reliable knowledge
removal. Of the generated adversarial prompts, 62.5% successfully retrieved
forgotten Harry Potter facts from WHP-unlearned Llama, while 50% exposed unfair
suppression of retained knowledge. Our work highlights the persistent risks of
information leakage, emphasizing the need for more robust unlearning strategies
for erasure.

TL;DR: The paper explores privacy risks in Federated Learning (FL) despite local differential privacy (LDP) protection, showing that Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) can still succeed with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding the effectiveness of MIAs against LDP-protected data in FL, providing theoretical and practical insights.

Method: Derives theoretical lower bounds for MIA success rates on LDP-protected data, focusing on fully connected or self-attention layers, and validates with practical evaluations on federated vision models.

Result: Even with LDP, privacy risks persist based on the privacy budget, and mitigating attacks with noise harms model utility.

Conclusion: LDP alone is insufficient for privacy in FL; balancing privacy and utility requires careful consideration of the privacy budget.

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative learning among clients via a
coordinating server while avoiding direct data sharing, offering a perceived
solution to preserve privacy. However, recent studies on Membership Inference
Attacks (MIAs) have challenged this notion, showing high success rates against
unprotected training data. While local differential privacy (LDP) is widely
regarded as a gold standard for privacy protection in data analysis, most
studies on MIAs either neglect LDP or fail to provide theoretical guarantees
for attack success rates against LDP-protected data. To address this gap, we
derive theoretical lower bounds for the success rates of low-polynomial time
MIAs that exploit vulnerabilities in fully connected or self-attention layers.
We establish that even when data are protected by LDP, privacy risks persist,
depending on the privacy budget. Practical evaluations on federated vision
models confirm considerable privacy risks, revealing that the noise required to
mitigate these attacks significantly degrades models' utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of systematic methods to evaluate LLM vulnerability to jailbreak attacks in safety-critical applications creates a security gap.

Method: Boa uses a three-phase approach: constructing block lists, breadth-first sampling, and depth-first priority search guided by safety scores.

Result: Boa enables rigorous security assessments, defense evaluation, and model certification under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: The formalization of the jailbreak oracle problem and Boa's algorithm provide a principled way to study and mitigate jailbreak vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in
safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their
vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We
introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding
strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with
likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a
principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle
problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows
exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first
efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a
three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal
patterns, (2) breadth-first sampling to identify easily accessible jailbreaks,
and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to
systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous
security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized
comparison of red team attacks, and model certification under extreme
adversarial conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces "plan injection," a new attack exploiting vulnerabilities in autonomous web navigation agents' context memory, showing higher success rates than prompt-based attacks and emphasizing the need for secure memory handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing deployment of autonomous web agents for complex tasks exposes security risks due to their reliance on vulnerable client-side or third-party memory systems, as demonstrated by recent attacks.

Method: The authors formalize "plan injection" attacks and evaluate them on two popular web agents (Browser-use and Agent-E), comparing their success rates with prompt-based attacks and introducing "context-chained injections."

Result: Plan injections achieve up to 3x higher success rates than prompt-based attacks, with context-chained injections increasing success by 17.7% for privacy exfiltration tasks.

Conclusion: Secure memory handling must be prioritized in agentic systems to mitigate such vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Autonomous web navigation agents, which translate natural language
instructions into sequences of browser actions, are increasingly deployed for
complex tasks across e-commerce, information retrieval, and content discovery.
Due to the stateless nature of large language models (LLMs), these agents rely
heavily on external memory systems to maintain context across interactions.
Unlike centralized systems where context is securely stored server-side, agent
memory is often managed client-side or by third-party applications, creating
significant security vulnerabilities. This was recently exploited to attack
production systems.
  We introduce and formalize "plan injection," a novel context manipulation
attack that corrupts these agents' internal task representations by targeting
this vulnerable context. Through systematic evaluation of two popular web
agents, Browser-use and Agent-E, we show that plan injections bypass robust
prompt injection defenses, achieving up to 3x higher attack success rates than
comparable prompt-based attacks. Furthermore, "context-chained injections,"
which craft logical bridges between legitimate user goals and attacker
objectives, lead to a 17.7% increase in success rate for privacy exfiltration
tasks. Our findings highlight that secure memory handling must be a first-class
concern in agentic systems.

Conclusion: XAI effectively addresses cybersecurity gaps in Healthcare 5.0, with network and biomedical data playing distinct roles in intrusion and spoofing detection, respectively.

Abstract: Healthcare 5.0 integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of
Things (IoT), real-time monitoring, and human-centered design toward
personalized medicine and predictive diagnostics. However, the increasing
reliance on interconnected medical technologies exposes them to cyber threats.
Meanwhile, current AI-driven cybersecurity models often neglect biomedical
data, limiting their effectiveness and interpretability. This study addresses
this gap by applying eXplainable AI (XAI) to a Healthcare 5.0 dataset that
integrates network traffic and biomedical sensor data. Classification outputs
indicate that XGBoost achieved 99% F1-score for benign and data alteration, and
81% for spoofing. Explainability findings reveal that network data play a
dominant role in intrusion detection whereas biomedical features contributed to
spoofing detection, with temperature reaching a Shapley values magnitude of
0.37.

### [609] [CUBA: Controlled Untargeted Backdoor Attack against Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17350)
*Yinghao Wu,Liyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUBA, a Constrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack, blending untargeted flexibility with targeted intentionality to evade defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks are mostly targeted, making them detectable. CUBA aims to combine untargeted randomness with controlled intentionality to bypass defenses.

Method: CUBA uses logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with flipped one-hot labels to constrain the attack's randomness within a selected target range.

Result: Experiments show CUBA effectively evades existing backdoor defense methods by producing uniform class distributions within constrained targets.

Conclusion: CUBA successfully merges untargeted and targeted attack properties, proving resilient against current defenses.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks have emerged as a critical security threat against deep
neural networks in recent years. The majority of existing backdoor attacks
focus on targeted backdoor attacks, where trigger is strongly associated to
specific malicious behavior. Various backdoor detection methods depend on this
inherent property and shows effective results in identifying and mitigating
such targeted attacks. However, a purely untargeted attack in backdoor
scenarios is, in some sense, self-weakening, since the target nature is what
makes backdoor attacks so powerful. In light of this, we introduce a novel
Constrained Untargeted Backdoor Attack (CUBA), which combines the flexibility
of untargeted attacks with the intentionality of targeted attacks. The
compromised model, when presented with backdoor images, will classify them into
random classes within a constrained range of target classes selected by the
attacker. This combination of randomness and determinedness enables the
proposed untargeted backdoor attack to natively circumvent existing backdoor
defense methods. To implement the untargeted backdoor attack under controlled
flexibility, we propose to apply logit normalization on cross-entropy loss with
flipped one-hot labels. By constraining the logit during training, the
compromised model will show a uniform distribution across selected target
classes, resulting in controlled untargeted attack. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CUBA on different datasets.

*Zongjie Li,Daoyuan Wu,Shuai Wang,Zhendong Su*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), a novel method for extracting SFT data from LLMs, demonstrates its effectiveness, and proposes a defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the risk of data extraction from SFT datasets, which are valuable but vulnerable.

Method: Develops DDE, leveraging model confidence and behavioral differences between fine-tuned and base models.

Result: DDE outperforms existing extraction methods in various attack settings.

Conclusion: Reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and suggests mitigation strategies.

Abstract: The increasing demand for domain-specific and human-aligned Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to the widespread adoption of Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) techniques. SFT datasets often comprise valuable instruction-response
pairs, making them highly valuable targets for potential extraction. This paper
studies this critical research problem for the first time. We start by formally
defining and formulating the problem, then explore various attack goals, types,
and variants based on the unique properties of SFT data in real-world
scenarios. Based on our analysis of extraction behaviors of direct extraction,
we develop a novel extraction method specifically designed for SFT models,
called Differentiated Data Extraction (DDE), which exploits the confidence
levels of fine-tuned models and their behavioral differences from pre-trained
base models. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains and
scenarios, we demonstrate the feasibility of SFT data extraction using DDE. Our
results show that DDE consistently outperforms existing extraction baselines in
all attack settings. To counter this new attack, we propose a defense mechanism
that mitigates DDE attacks with minimal impact on model performance. Overall,
our research reveals hidden data leak risks in fine-tuned LLMs and provides
insights for developing more secure models.

### [611] [Shrinking the Generation-Verification Gap with Weak Verifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18203)
*Jon Saad-Falcon,E. Kelly Buchanan,Mayee F. Chen,Tzu-Heng Huang,Brendan McLaughlin,Tanvir Bhathal,Shang Zhu,Ben Athiwaratkun,Frederic Sala,Scott Linderman,Azalia Mirhoseini,Christopher RÃ©*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Weaver is a framework combining multiple weak verifiers into a strong one, improving response selection in language models without heavy labeled data dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between imperfect verifiers (like LM judges) and oracle verifiers by leveraging weak supervision and ensemble methods.

Method: Weaver combines weak verifiers using weighted ensembles, normalizes outputs with dataset statistics, and filters low-quality verifiers. It also trains a smaller cross-encoder for efficiency.

Result: Weaver significantly improves Pass@1 performance, achieving 87.7% accuracy in reasoning and math tasks, comparable to GPT-4o's gains.

Conclusion: Weaver effectively enhances verifier performance with minimal labeled data, offering a scalable solution for improving language model outputs.

Abstract: Verifiers can improve language model capabilities by scoring and ranking
responses from generated candidates. Currently, high-quality verifiers are
either unscalable (e.g., humans) or limited in utility (e.g., tools like Lean).
While LM judges and reward models have become broadly useful as general-purpose
verifiers, a significant performance gap remains between them and oracle
verifiers (verifiers with perfect accuracy). To help close this gap, we
introduce Weaver, a framework for designing a strong verifier by combining
multiple weak, imperfect verifiers. We find weighted ensembles of verifiers,
which typically require learning from labeled data, significantly outperform
unweighted combinations due to differences in verifier accuracies. To reduce
dependency on labeled data, Weaver leverages weak supervision to estimate each
verifier's accuracy and combines outputs into a unified score that better
reflects true response quality. However, directly applying weak supervision
algorithms poses challenges, including inconsistent verifier output formats and
handling low-quality verifiers. Weaver addresses these using dataset statistics
to normalize outputs and filter specific verifiers. We study Weaver's
effectiveness in test-time repeated sampling, where a model generates multiple
candidate responses and selects one. Our evaluations show Weaver significantly
improves over Pass@1-performance when selecting the first candidate-across
reasoning and math tasks, achieving o3-mini-level accuracy with Llama 3.3 70B
Instruct as generator, and an ensemble of 70B or smaller judge and reward
models as verifiers (87.7% average). This gain mirrors the jump between GPT-4o
and o3-mini (69.0% vs. 86.7%), which required extensive finetuning and
post-training. To reduce computational costs of verifier ensembles, we train a
400M cross-encoder using Weaver's combined output scores.

### [612] [Efficient Malware Detection with Optimized Learning on High-Dimensional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17309)
*Aditya Choudhary,Sarthak Pawar,Yashodhara Haribhakta*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes using XGBoost-based feature selection and PCA to reduce high-dimensional malware detection features, achieving high accuracy with LightGBM on reduced dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional feature vectors in malware detection introduce computational challenges, necessitating efficient dimensionality reduction.

Method: Applied XGBoost feature selection and PCA to reduce 2381 features to 128, 256, and 384 dimensions. Evaluated four models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, Random Forest) on unified datasets.

Result: LightGBM on 384-dimensional features achieved 97.52% accuracy, with strong generalization (95.31% on TRITIUM, 93.98% on INFERNO).

Conclusion: The approach balances computational efficiency and accuracy, offering a scalable solution for malware detection.

Abstract: Malware detection using machine learning requires feature extraction from
binary files, as models cannot process raw binaries directly. A common approach
involves using LIEF for raw feature extraction and the EMBER vectorizer to
generate 2381-dimensional feature vectors. However, the high dimensionality of
these features introduces significant computational challenges. This study
addresses these challenges by applying two dimensionality reduction techniques:
XGBoost-based feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We
evaluate three reduced feature dimensions (128, 256, and 384), which correspond
to approximately 5.4%, 10.8%, and 16.1% of the original 2381 features, across
four models-XGBoost, LightGBM, Extra Trees, and Random Forest-using a unified
training, validation, and testing split formed from the EMBER-2018, ERMDS, and
BODMAS datasets. This approach ensures generalization and avoids dataset bias.
Experimental results show that LightGBM trained on the 384-dimensional feature
set after XGBoost feature selection achieves the highest accuracy of 97.52% on
the unified dataset, providing an optimal balance between computational
efficiency and detection performance. The best model, trained in 61 minutes
using 30 GB of RAM and 19.5 GB of disk space, generalizes effectively to
completely unseen datasets, maintaining 95.31% accuracy on TRITIUM and 93.98%
accuracy on INFERNO. These findings present a scalable, compute-efficient
approach for malware detection without compromising accuracy.

### [613] [Mechanistic Interpretability in the Presence of Architectural Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18053)
*Marcos Florencio,Thomas Barton*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Architectural obfuscation in LLMs alters activation patterns but preserves computational graphs, hindering interpretability while maintaining task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study whether architectural obfuscation thwarts mechanistic interpretability or merely relocates circuits.

Method: Analyzed a GPT-2-small model with obfuscation using logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and attention-head ablation.

Result: Obfuscation disrupts activation patterns and hampers reverse-engineering but leaves feed-forward and residual pathways intact.

Conclusion: Obfuscation retains global model behavior while impeding fine-grained interpretability, guiding future privacy defenses.

Abstract: Architectural obfuscation - e.g., permuting hidden-state tensors, linearly
transforming embedding tables, or remapping tokens - has recently gained
traction as a lightweight substitute for heavyweight cryptography in
privacy-preserving large-language-model (LLM) inference. While recent work has
shown that these techniques can be broken under dedicated reconstruction
attacks, their impact on mechanistic interpretability has not been
systematically studied. In particular, it remains unclear whether scrambling a
network's internal representations truly thwarts efforts to understand how the
model works, or simply relocates the same circuits to an unfamiliar coordinate
system. We address this gap by analyzing a GPT-2-small model trained from
scratch with a representative obfuscation map. Assuming the obfuscation map is
private and the original basis is hidden (mirroring an honest-but-curious
server), we apply logit-lens attribution, causal path-patching, and
attention-head ablation to locate and manipulate known circuits. Our findings
reveal that obfuscation dramatically alters activation patterns within
attention heads yet preserves the layer-wise computational graph. This
disconnect hampers reverse-engineering of user prompts: causal traces lose
their alignment with baseline semantics, and token-level logit attributions
become too noisy to reconstruct. At the same time, feed-forward and residual
pathways remain functionally intact, suggesting that obfuscation degrades
fine-grained interpretability without compromising top-level task performance.
These results establish quantitative evidence that architectural obfuscation
can simultaneously (i) retain global model behaviour and (ii) impede
mechanistic analyses of user-specific content. By mapping where
interpretability breaks down, our study provides guidance for future privacy
defences and for robustness-aware interpretability tooling.

### [614] [A Locally Differential Private Coding-Assisted Succinct Histogram Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17767)
*Hsuan-Po Liu,Hessam Mahdavifar*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A practical LDP protocol using polar codes and Gaussian perturbations for constructing succinct histograms, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure privacy and data utility in large-scale, privacy-sensitive machine learning by leveraging error-correcting codes under LDP.

Method: Uses polar codes and SCL decoding with Gaussian-based perturbations for efficient soft decoding.

Result: Outperforms prior methods, especially for low-frequency items, while maintaining accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed protocol effectively balances privacy and utility for succinct histograms.

Abstract: A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across
clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale,
privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous
framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local
differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To
preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally
adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising
tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first
practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms
using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their
successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the
underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces
Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items
with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation
accuracy.

### [615] [AdRo-FL: Informed and Secure Client Selection for Federated Learning in the Presence of Adversarial Aggregator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17805)
*Md. Kamrul Hossain,Walid Aljoby,Anis Elgabli,Ahmed M. Abdelmoniem,Khaled A. Harras*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AdRo-FL introduces a robust federated learning framework that defends against Biased Selection Attacks while enabling informed client selection, improving both performance and privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FL systems are vulnerable to Biased Selection Attacks (BSA) where adversarial aggregators bypass Secure Aggregation (SA) by manipulating client selection, compromising privacy and performance.

Method: AdRo-FL proposes two client selection frameworks: one for clustered clients with mutual trust (enforcing quotas and utility-based selection) and another for distributed clients (using utility-driven ranking and verifiable random functions). It also includes quantization and strict deadlines for efficiency.

Result: AdRo-FL achieves up to 1.85Ã faster time-to-accuracy and 1.06Ã higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.

Conclusion: AdRo-FL effectively balances informed client selection and robust defense against BSA, enhancing both performance and privacy in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning without exposing
clients' data. While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,
studies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these
updates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during
transmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where
adversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,
constituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random
selection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL
performance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which
simultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and
robust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL
implements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The
first framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual
trust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework
handles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.
For the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)
enforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a
cluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to
prioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a
two-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients
based on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)
ensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to
reduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve
energy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\times$ faster time-to-accuracy
and up to $1.06\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of maintaining efficient performance while ensuring data privacy in AI-driven edge and cloud systems.

Method: Combines federated learning with secure multi-party computation and LLMs, integrating adversarial training for threat resistance.

Result: Outperforms traditional federated learning by 15% in data protection and model robustness.

Conclusion: The method effectively improves security and efficiency in edge cloud AI systems.

Abstract: With the widespread application of edge computing and cloud systems in

edge cloud AI systems, and use large-scale language models (LLMs) to enhance
data privacy protection and system robustness. Based on the existing federated
learning framework, this method introduces a secure multi-party computation
protocol, which optimizes the data aggregation and encryption process between
distributed nodes by using LLM to ensure data privacy and improve system
efficiency. By combining advanced adversarial training techniques, the model
enhances the resistance of edge cloud AI systems to security threats such as
data leakage and model poisoning. Experimental results show that the proposed
method is 15% better than the traditional federated learning method in terms of
data protection and model robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of IoT introduces security challenges, and traditional IDS models lack temporal awareness for early threat detection.

Method: Proposes EIDS using Transformer architecture with dynamic temporal positional encodings and a data augmentation pipeline.

Result: Outperforms existing models on CICIoT2023 dataset in accuracy and earliness, with real-time feasibility on IoT devices.

Conclusion: EIDS enhances intrusion detection by capturing temporal irregularities, offering efficient and adaptive security for IoT.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced
significant security challenges, necessitating efficient and adaptive Intrusion
Detection Systems (IDS). Traditional IDS models often overlook the temporal
characteristics of network traffic, limiting their effectiveness in early
threat detection. We propose a Transformer-based Early Intrusion Detection
System (EIDS) that incorporates dynamic temporal positional encodings to
enhance detection accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. By
leveraging network flow timestamps, our approach captures both sequence
structure and timing irregularities indicative of malicious behaviour.
Additionally, we introduce a data augmentation pipeline to improve model
robustness. Evaluated on the CICIoT2023 dataset, our method outperforms
existing models in both accuracy and earliness. We further demonstrate its
real-time feasibility on resource-constrained IoT devices, achieving
low-latency inference and minimal memory footprint.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes Smart-LLaMA-DPO, a method for smart contract vulnerability detection, addressing dataset limitations and LLM misinterpretations. It outperforms baselines with improved F1 and accuracy scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing smart contract vulnerability detection methods lack comprehensive datasets and struggle with LLM misinterpretations of security concepts.

Method: The approach involves constructing a comprehensive dataset, continual pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with human feedback.

Result: Smart-LLaMA-DPO achieves average improvements of 10.43% in F1 score and 7.87% in accuracy, with better explanations.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances smart contract vulnerability detection and explanation quality.

Abstract: Smart contract vulnerability detection remains a major challenge in
blockchain security. Existing vulnerability detection methods face two main
issues: (1) Existing datasets lack comprehensive coverage and high-quality
explanations for preference learning. (2) Large language models (LLMs) often
struggle with accurately interpreting specific concepts in smart contract
security. Empirical analysis shows that even after continual pre-training (CPT)
and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), LLMs may misinterpret the execution order of
state changes, resulting in incorrect explanations despite making correct
detection decisions. To address these challenges, we propose Smart-LLaMA-DPO
based on LLaMA-3.1-8B. We construct a comprehensive dataset covering four major
vulnerability types and machine-unauditable vulnerabilities, including precise
labels, explanations, and locations for SFT, as well as high-quality and
low-quality output pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Second, we
perform CPT using large-scale smart contract to enhance the LLM's understanding
of specific security practices in smart contracts. Futhermore, we conduct SFT
with our comprehensive dataset. Finally, we apply DPO, leveraging human
feedback and a specially designed loss function that increases the probability
of preferred explanations while reducing the likelihood of non-preferred
outputs. We evaluate Smart-LLaMA-DPO on four major vulnerability types:
reentrancy, timestamp dependence, integer overflow/underflow, and delegatecall,
as well as machine-unauditable vulnerabilities. Our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with average improvements of 10.43% in
F1 score and 7.87% in accuracy. Moreover, both LLM evaluation and human
evaluation confirm that our method generates more correct, thorough, and clear
explanations.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the vulnerability of DeepSeek-series LLMs to jailbreak attacks, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. DeepSeek shows selective robustness due to its MoE architecture but higher vulnerability to certain attacks, unlike GPT-4 Turbo's consistent safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the robustness of open-source LLMs like DeepSeek against jailbreak attacks, given their growing use and lack of thorough evaluation compared to proprietary models.

Method: Systematic evaluation using HarmBench, testing seven attack strategies across 510 harmful behaviors, comparing DeepSeek with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

Result: DeepSeek's MoE architecture provides selective robustness but higher vulnerability to prompt-based attacks, while GPT-4 Turbo shows stronger, consistent safety.

Conclusion: Open-source LLMs need targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to balance architectural efficiency and alignment generalization.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large language models (LLMs) has raised critical
concerns over their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, i.e., adversarial
prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms and elicit harmful or policy-violating
outputs. While proprietary models like GPT-4 have undergone extensive
evaluation, the robustness of emerging open-source alternatives such as
DeepSeek remains largely underexplored, despite their growing adoption in
real-world applications. In this paper, we present the first systematic
jailbreak evaluation of DeepSeek-series models, comparing them with GPT-3.5 and
GPT-4 using the HarmBench benchmark. We evaluate seven representative attack
strategies across 510 harmful behaviors categorized by both function and
semantic domain. Our analysis reveals that DeepSeek's Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architecture introduces routing sparsity that offers selective robustness
against optimization-based attacks such as TAP-T, but leads to significantly
higher vulnerability under prompt-based and manually engineered attacks. In
contrast, GPT-4 Turbo demonstrates stronger and more consistent safety
alignment across diverse behaviors, likely due to its dense Transformer design
and reinforcement learning from human feedback. Fine-grained behavioral
analysis and case studies further show that DeepSeek often routes adversarial
prompts to under-aligned expert modules, resulting in inconsistent refusal
behaviors. These findings highlight a fundamental trade-off between
architectural efficiency and alignment generalization, emphasizing the need for
targeted safety tuning and modular alignment strategies to ensure secure
deployment of open-source LLMs.

### [620] [Zero-Shot Cognitive Impairment Detection from Speech Using AudioLLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17351)
*Mostafa Shahin,Beena Ahmed,Julien Epps*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes a zero-shot speech-based method for cognitive impairment detection using Qwen2-AudioLLM, showing comparable performance to supervised methods with cross-language generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cognitive impairment is crucial, and speech offers a non-invasive biomarker. Traditional methods require manual annotation and lack generalizability.

Method: Uses Qwen2-AudioLLM with prompt-based instructions to classify speech samples as normal or impaired, evaluated on English and multilingual datasets.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to supervised methods, with strong generalizability across languages, tasks, and datasets.

Conclusion: The zero-shot AudioLLM approach is effective, scalable, and generalizable for cognitive impairment detection.

Abstract: Cognitive impairment (CI) is of growing public health concern, and early
detection is vital for effective intervention. Speech has gained attention as a
non-invasive and easily collectible biomarker for assessing cognitive decline.
Traditional CI detection methods typically rely on supervised models trained on
acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech, which often require
manual annotation and may not generalise well across datasets and languages. In
this work, we propose the first zero-shot speech-based CI detection method
using the Qwen2- Audio AudioLLM, a model capable of processing both audio and
text inputs. By designing prompt-based instructions, we guide the model in
classifying speech samples as indicative of normal cognition or cognitive
impairment. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: one in English and
another multilingual, spanning different cognitive assessment tasks. Our
results show that the zero-shot AudioLLM approach achieves performance
comparable to supervised methods and exhibits promising generalizability and
consistency across languages, tasks, and datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes using ASR models to transcribe and detect AI-generated music lyrics, showing robustness against perturbations and outperforming audio-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in detecting AI-generated music when perfect lyrics are unavailable, improving real-life applicability.

Method: Uses ASR models (e.g., Whisper large-v2) and LLM2Vec embeddings to transcribe and detect AI-generated lyrics.

Result: Strong detection performance across languages and genres, with robustness to audio perturbations and unseen generators.

Conclusion: The method is effective and practical for real-world AI-generated music detection, outperforming audio-based approaches.

Abstract: The recent rise in capabilities of AI-based music generation tools has
created an upheaval in the music industry, necessitating the creation of
accurate methods to detect such AI-generated content. This can be done using
audio-based detectors; however, it has been shown that they struggle to
generalize to unseen generators or when the audio is perturbed. Furthermore,
recent work used accurate and cleanly formatted lyrics sourced from a lyrics
provider database to detect AI-generated music. However, in practice, such
perfect lyrics are not available (only the audio is); this leaves a substantial
gap in applicability in real-life use cases. In this work, we instead propose
solving this gap by transcribing songs using general automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models. We do this using several detectors. The results on
diverse, multi-genre, and multi-lingual lyrics show generally strong detection
performance across languages and genres, particularly for our best-performing
model using Whisper large-v2 and LLM2Vec embeddings. In addition, we show that
our method is more robust than state-of-the-art audio-based ones when the audio
is perturbed in different ways and when evaluated on different music
generators. Our code is available at

*Duygu Altinok*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method using large language models (LLMs) to transcribe disfluencies in spoken language as explicit tokens with timestamps, showing robustness even with imperfect textual inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving automatic speech and language processing systems by accurately detecting disfluencies for more inclusive technologies.

Method: Integrates acoustic representations with textual inputs (clean or imperfect) and uses LLMs to generate disfluency-annotated transcripts.

Result: LLMs can effectively handle imperfect textual inputs with timestamp cues to produce accurate disfluency transcripts.

Conclusion: LLMs are robust for disfluency transcription, even with imperfect inputs, enhancing speech and language technologies.

Abstract: Accurate detection of disfluencies in spoken language is crucial for
enhancing the performance of automatic speech and language processing systems,
as well as fostering the development of more inclusive speech and language
technologies. Leveraging the growing trend of large language models (LLMs) as
versatile learners capable of processing both lexical and non-lexical inputs
(e.g., audio and video), we propose a novel approach to transcribing
disfluencies as explicit tokens with timestamps, enabling the generation of
fully annotated disfluency-rich transcripts. Our method integrates acoustic
representations extracted from an audio encoder with textual inputs of varying
quality: clean transcriptions without disfluencies, time-aligned transcriptions
from aligners, or outputs from phoneme-based ASR models -- all of which may
contain imperfections. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that textual
inputs do not need to be flawless. As long as they include timestamp-related
cues, LLMs can effectively smooth the input and produce fully
disfluency-annotated transcripts, underscoring their robustness in handling
imperfect hints.

*Mingyang Yao,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes a two-stage training method for composer-style music generation, leveraging pre-training on a broad music corpus and fine-tuning with a lightweight adapter for style-specific modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity for certain control modalities, like composer-style music generation, limits modeling of styles and fundamental music elements.

Method: A two-stage approach: pre-train a REMI-based model on a diverse music corpus, then fine-tune it on a small dataset of four composers using a lightweight adapter for style conditioning.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in style accuracy and musicality, achieving precise composer-style modeling and better aesthetics.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines general music knowledge with style-specific refinement, demonstrating improved performance in composer-style generation.

Abstract: Despite progress in controllable symbolic music generation, data scarcity
remains a challenge for certain control modalities. Composer-style music
generation is a prime example, as only a few pieces per composer are available,
limiting the modeling of both styles and fundamental music elements (e.g.,
melody, chord, rhythm). In this paper, we investigate how general music
knowledge learned from a broad corpus can enhance the mastery of specific
composer styles, with a focus on piano piece generation. Our approach follows a
two-stage training paradigm. First, we pre-train a REMI-based music generation
model on a large corpus of pop, folk, and classical music. Then, we fine-tune
it on a small, human-verified dataset from four renowned composers, namely
Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, using a lightweight adapter module to
condition the model on style indicators. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we conduct both objective and subjective evaluations on style
accuracy and musicality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms ablations and baselines, achieving more precise composer-style
modeling and better musical aesthetics. Additionally, we provide observations
on how the model builds music concepts from the generality pre-training and
refines its stylistic understanding through the mastery fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSL models are domain-specific (speech or non-speech), limiting their versatility. USAD aims to integrate diverse audio types into one model.

Method: USAD uses layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train a unified student model on a comprehensive audio dataset.

Result: Competitive performance across benchmarks (SUPERB, HEAR) in speech processing, audio tagging, and sound classification.

Conclusion: USAD successfully unifies audio representation learning, offering versatility and strong performance with a single encoder.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized audio representations, yet
models often remain domain-specific, focusing on either speech or non-speech
tasks. In this work, we present Universal Speech and Audio Distillation (USAD),
a unified approach to audio representation learning that integrates diverse
audio types - speech, sound, and music - into a single model. USAD employs
efficient layer-to-layer distillation from domain-specific SSL models to train
a student on a comprehensive audio dataset. USAD offers competitive performance
across various benchmarks and datasets, including frame and instance-level
speech processing tasks, audio tagging, and sound classification, achieving

TL;DR: CultureMERT-95M improves cross-cultural music representation learning with a two-stage pre-training strategy, outperforming prior models on non-Western music tasks while maintaining Western performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited effectiveness of music foundation models across diverse musical traditions.

Method: A two-stage continual pre-training strategy with learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, trained on a 650-hour multi-cultural dataset (Greek, Turkish, Indian).

Result: 4.9% average improvement in ROC-AUC and AP for non-Western auto-tagging tasks, with no regression on Western benchmarks.

Conclusion: CultureMERT-95M and its task arithmetic variant enhance cross-cultural music understanding and are publicly released to support further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in music foundation models have improved audio representation
learning, yet their effectiveness across diverse musical traditions remains
limited. We introduce CultureMERT-95M, a multi-culturally adapted foundation
model developed to enhance cross-cultural music representation learning and
understanding. To achieve this, we propose a two-stage continual pre-training
strategy that integrates learning rate re-warming and re-decaying, enabling
stable adaptation even with limited computational resources. Training on a
650-hour multi-cultural data mix, comprising Greek, Turkish, and Indian music
traditions, results in an average improvement of 4.9% in ROC-AUC and AP across
diverse non-Western music auto-tagging tasks, surpassing prior
state-of-the-art, with minimal forgetting on Western-centric benchmarks. We
further investigate task arithmetic, an alternative approach to multi-cultural
adaptation that merges single-culture adapted models in the weight space. Task
arithmetic performs on par with our multi-culturally trained model on
non-Western auto-tagging tasks and shows no regression on Western datasets.
Cross-cultural evaluation reveals that single-culture models transfer with
varying effectiveness across musical traditions, whereas the multi-culturally
adapted model achieves the best overall performance. To support research on
world music representation learning, we publicly release CultureMERT-95M and
CultureMERT-TA-95M, fostering the development of more culturally aware music
foundation models.

*Quoc Thinh Vo,Joe Woods,Priontu Chowdhury,David K. Han*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: A multi-branch network architecture using CNNs and Conformers with self-attention is proposed for accurate underwater sound source localization, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localizing acoustic sources in the ocean is challenging due to high noise, irregular geometries, and varying acoustic properties.

Method: The network combines CNNs for spatial features and Conformers for temporal dependencies, using log-mel spectrograms and GCC-PHAT features. An AGC layer ensures consistent input energy levels.

Result: The method outperforms SOTA approaches, even with limited test-domain data for fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture sets new benchmarks for underwater sound localization, demonstrating robust performance in complex environments.

Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to
the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high
background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic
properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we
propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the
distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world
underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with
self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel
spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT)
features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model
performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively
adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels
across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the
model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it
in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain
for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater
sound localization.

*Yuqin Dai,Wanlu Zhu,Ronghui Li,Xiu Li,Zhenyu Zhang,Jun Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: TCDiff++ is a music-driven framework for harmonious group dance generation, addressing multi-dancer collisions, foot sliding, and abrupt swapping in long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with multi-dancer collisions, foot sliding, and abrupt swapping in long group dance generation.

Method: Uses dancer positioning embedding, distance-consistency loss, swap mode embedding, Footwork Adaptor, long group diffusion sampling, and Sequence Decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality group dance.

Conclusion: TCDiff++ effectively addresses key challenges in group dance generation, delivering superior results.

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its
wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group
choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing
methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer
foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this
paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to
generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer
collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the
relative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a
distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within
plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we
introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design
a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For
long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling
strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional
information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder
layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and
coherent group dance generation.

*Nasser-Eddine Monir,Paul Magron,Romain Serizel*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposed perceptually-informed SDR loss variants for speech enhancement, improving perceptual metrics and phoneme intelligibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional loss functions like SDR may not preserve fine-grained spectral cues crucial for phoneme intelligibility.

Method: Developed frequency-weighted SDR loss variants, including fixed (ANSI band-importance) and adaptive (spectral/dynamic) weighting schemes, applied to FaSNet.

Result: Marginal SDR improvement but substantial gains in perceptual metrics and better consonant reconstruction.

Conclusion: Perceptually-informed losses enhance phoneme-level speech cues, improving intelligibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved multichannel
speech enhancement algorithms, yet conventional training loss functions such as
the scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) may fail to preserve
fine-grained spectral cues essential for phoneme intelligibility. In this work,
we propose perceptually-informed variants of the SDR loss, formulated in the
time-frequency domain and modulated by frequency-dependent weighting schemes.
These weights are designed to emphasize time-frequency regions where speech is
prominent or where the interfering noise is particularly strong. We investigate
both fixed and adaptive strategies, including ANSI band-importance weights,
spectral magnitude-based weighting, and dynamic weighting based on the relative
amount of speech and noise. We train the FaSNet multichannel speech enhancement
model using these various losses. Experimental results show that while standard
metrics such as the SDR are only marginally improved, their perceptual
frequency-weighted counterparts exhibit a more substantial improvement.
Besides, spectral and phoneme-level analysis indicates better consonant
reconstruction, which points to a better preservation of certain acoustic cues.

TL;DR: MuseControlLite is a lightweight method for fine-tuning text-to-music models, improving control accuracy with fewer parameters by using positional embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance precision in text-to-music generation by leveraging time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals.

Method: Uses rotary positional embeddings in decoupled cross-attention layers for better time-function conditioning.

Result: Increases control accuracy from 56.6% to 61.1% with 6.75x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MuseControlLite offers improved controllability at lower fine-tuning cost, outperforming existing models like MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet.

Abstract: We propose MuseControlLite, a lightweight mechanism designed to fine-tune
text-to-music generation models for precise conditioning using various
time-varying musical attributes and reference audio signals. The key finding is
that positional embeddings, which have been seldom used by text-to-music
generation models in the conditioner for text conditions, are critical when the
condition of interest is a function of time. Using melody control as an
example, our experiments show that simply adding rotary positional embeddings
to the decoupled cross-attention layers increases control accuracy from 56.6%
to 61.1%, while requiring 6.75 times fewer trainable parameters than
state-of-the-art fine-tuning mechanisms, using the same pre-trained diffusion
Transformer model of Stable Audio Open. We evaluate various forms of musical
attribute control, audio inpainting, and audio outpainting, demonstrating
improved controllability over MusicGen-Large and Stable Audio Open ControlNet
at a significantly lower fine-tuning cost, with only 85M trainble parameters.

*Duong Bach*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a framework for synchronized memory pruning in multi-agent systems (MAS), combining semantic voting, temporal decay, and PBFT consensus to reduce memory footprint and improve efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Managing shared knowledge in MAS is challenging due to outdated or irrelevant data. The protocol aims to mimic biological forgetting to maintain synchronized, relevant memories.

Method: The protocol integrates context-aware semantic voting (using DistilBERT), multi-scale temporal decay, and PBFT consensus for fault-tolerant decision-making. It uses gRPC, Pinecone, and SQLite for communication and storage.

Result: Experiments show a 52% memory reduction, 88% voting accuracy, 92% consensus success under Byzantine conditions, and 82% cache hit rate.

Conclusion: The Co-Forgetting Protocol effectively addresses memory management in MAS, balancing efficiency, accuracy, and fault tolerance.

Abstract: The proliferation of multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex, dynamic
environments necessitates robust and efficient mechanisms for managing shared
knowledge. A critical challenge is ensuring that distributed memories remain
synchronized, relevant, and free from the accumulation of outdated or
inconsequential data - a process analogous to biological forgetting. This paper
introduces the Co-Forgetting Protocol, a novel, comprehensive framework
designed to address this challenge by enabling synchronized memory pruning in
MAS. The protocol integrates three key components: (1) context-aware semantic
voting, where agents utilize a lightweight DistilBERT model to assess the
relevance of memory items based on their content and the current operational
context; (2) multi-scale temporal decay functions, which assign diminishing
importance to memories based on their age and access frequency across different
time horizons; and (3) a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based
consensus mechanism, ensuring that decisions to retain or discard memory items
are agreed upon by a qualified and fault-tolerant majority of agents, even in
the presence of up to f Byzantine (malicious or faulty) agents in a system of N
greater than or equal to 3f+1 agents. The protocol leverages gRPC for efficient
inter-agent communication and Pinecone for scalable vector embedding storage
and similarity search, with SQLite managing metadata. Experimental evaluations
in a simulated MAS environment with four agents demonstrate the protocol's
efficacy, achieving a 52% reduction in memory footprint over 500 epochs, 88%
voting accuracy in forgetting decisions against human-annotated benchmarks, a
92% PBFT consensus success rate under simulated Byzantine conditions, and an
82% cache hit rate for memory access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local search in vehicle routing problems is computationally expensive, especially for large or complex instances, necessitating efficient acceleration methods.

Method: The proposed method uses an attribute-based representation and offloads intensive computations to the GPU, ensuring extensibility and low-coupling integration.

Result: Comparative experiments show significant computational advantages over CPU-based implementations, with detailed analysis of strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: The findings enhance understanding of GPU acceleration for local search and suggest future improvements, highlighting its potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Local search plays a central role in many effective heuristic algorithms for
the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and its variants. However, neighborhood
exploration is known to be computationally expensive and time consuming,
especially for large instances or problems with complex constraints. In this
study, we explore a promising direction to address this challenge by
introducing an original tensor-based GPU acceleration method designed to speed
up the commonly used local search operators in vehicle routing. By using an
attribute-based representation, the method offers broad extensibility, making
it applicable to different VRP variants. Its low-coupling architecture, with
intensive computations completely offloaded to the GPU, ensures seamless
integration in various local search-based algorithms and frameworks, leading to
significant improvements in computational efficiency and potentially improved
solution quality. Through comparative experiments on benchmark instances of
three routing problems, we demonstrate the substantial computational advantages
of the proposed approach over traditional CPU-based implementations. We also
provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and limitations of the method,
providing valuable insights into its performance characteristics and
identifying potential bottlenecks in practical applications. These findings
contribute to a better understanding and suggest directions for future
improvements.

Result: The framework identifies inefficiencies in resource sharing, unfair scheduling, and static model server configurations, offering insights for optimization.

Conclusion: ConsumerBench provides practical guidance for developers, emphasizing custom kernels and SLO-aware scheduling to improve performance on consumer-grade hardware.

Abstract: The recent shift in Generative AI (GenAI) applications from cloud-only
environments to end-user devices introduces new challenges in resource
management, system efficiency, and user experience. This paper presents
ConsumerBench, a comprehensive benchmarking framework designed to evaluate the
system efficiency and response time of GenAI models running on end-user

supports customizable workflows that simulate complex tasks requiring
coordination among multiple applications. ConsumerBench captures both
application-level metrics, including latency and Service Level Objective (SLO)
attainment, and system-level metrics like CPU/GPU utilization and memory
bandwidth. Through extensive experiments, ConsumerBench reveals inefficiencies
in resource sharing, unfair scheduling under greedy allocation, and performance
pitfalls of static model server configurations. The paper also provides
practical insights for model developers and system designers, highlighting the
benefits of custom kernels tailored to consumer-grade GPU architectures and the
value of implementing SLO-aware scheduling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and communication bottlenecks in LLM-based recommendation systems due to large model sizes and data volumes.

Method: Implements tensor and pipeline parallelism with load-balancing for model parallelism, and combines gradient compression/sparsification with synchronous/asynchronous modes for data parallelism.

Result: Hybrid parallelism increases training throughput by 30% and resource utilization by 20%, maintaining scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: Highlights trade-offs in parallel strategies and suggests future work on heterogeneous hardware and automated scheduling.

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in recommendation
systems, the computational and communication bottlenecks caused by their
massive parameter sizes and large data volumes have become increasingly
prominent. This paper systematically investigates two classes of optimization
methods-model parallelism and data parallelism-for distributed training of LLMs
in recommendation scenarios. For model parallelism, we implement both tensor
parallelism and pipeline parallelism, and introduce an adaptive load-balancing
mechanism to reduce cross-device communication overhead. For data parallelism,
we compare synchronous and asynchronous modes, combining gradient compression
and sparsification techniques with an efficient aggregation communication
framework to significantly improve bandwidth utilization. Experiments conducted
on a real-world recommendation dataset in a simulated service environment
demonstrate that our proposed hybrid parallelism scheme increases training
throughput by over 30% and improves resource utilization by approximately 20%
compared to traditional single-mode parallelism, while maintaining strong
scalability and robustness. Finally, we discuss trade-offs among different
parallel strategies in online deployment and outline future directions
involving heterogeneous hardware integration and automated scheduling
technologies.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A surrogate model using an artificial neural network unifies kinetic and equilibrium regimes for methane steam reforming, achieving high predictive accuracy and robustness for process optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient hydrogen production, especially for fuel cells, drives the development of a unified model for methane steam reforming, overcoming limitations of existing models that address only one regime.

Method: An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset (experimental, interpolated, and theoretical data) with data augmentation and weighted training. Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling were evaluated for model selection.

Result: The model showed high accuracy (mean squared error of 0.000498) and strong correlation (Pearson coefficient of 0.927), with continuous derivatives for process modeling.

Conclusion: The surrogate model is robust for simulating methane steam reforming in both regimes, proving valuable for design and optimization.

Abstract: Hydrogen's role is growing as an energy carrier, increasing the need for
efficient production, with methane steam reforming being the most widely used
technique. This process is crucial for applications like fuel cells, where
hydrogen is converted into electricity, pushing for reactor miniaturization and
optimized process control through numerical simulations. Existing models
typically address either kinetic or equilibrium regimes, limiting their
applicability. Here we show a surrogate model capable of unifying both regimes.
An artificial neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset that includes
experimental data from kinetic and equilibrium experiments, interpolated data,
and theoretical data derived from theoretical models for each regime. Data
augmentation and assigning appropriate weights to each data type enhanced
training. After evaluating Bayesian Optimization and Random Sampling, the
optimal model demonstrated high predictive accuracy for the composition of the
post-reaction mixture under varying operating parameters, indicated by a mean
squared error of 0.000498 and strong Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.927.
The network's ability to provide continuous derivatives of its predictions
makes it particularly useful for process modeling and optimization. The results
confirm the surrogate model's robustness for simulating methane steam reforming
in both kinetic and equilibrium regimes, making it a valuable tool for design
and process optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Differential Graph Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic stock relationship modeling and price prediction, outperforming baselines with optimal correlation metrics and clustering insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock price prediction is challenging due to nonlinear dynamics and evolving inter-stock correlations, which traditional static models fail to capture.

Method: The DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into multi-head self-attention, using causal temporal attention and evaluating correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's Tau) as spatial-attention priors.

Result: DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87). Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). Clustering revealed stable correlations in defensive stocks.

Conclusion: The study innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers, validating dynamic modeling and identifying optimal metrics. The framework advances financial prediction through dynamic interaction analysis.

Abstract: Stock price prediction is vital for investment decisions and risk management,
yet remains challenging due to markets' nonlinear dynamics and time-varying
inter-stock correlations. Traditional static-correlation models fail to capture
evolving stock relationships. To address this, we propose a Differential Graph
Transformer (DGT) framework for dynamic relationship modeling and price
prediction. Our DGT integrates sequential graph structure changes into
multi-head self-attention via a differential graph mechanism, adaptively
preserving high-value connections while suppressing noise. Causal temporal
attention captures global/local dependencies in price sequences. We further
evaluate correlation metrics (Pearson, Mutual Information, Spearman, Kendall's
Tau) across global/local/dual scopes as spatial-attention priors. Using 10
years of S&P 500 closing prices (z-score normalized; 64-day sliding windows),
DGT with spatial priors outperformed GRU baselines (RMSE: 0.24 vs. 0.87).
Kendall's Tau global matrices yielded optimal results (MAE: 0.11). K-means
clustering revealed "high-volatility growth" and "defensive blue-chip" stocks,
with the latter showing lower errors (RMSE: 0.13) due to stable correlations.
Kendall's Tau and Mutual Information excelled in volatile sectors. This study
innovatively combines differential graph structures with Transformers,
validating dynamic relationship modeling and identifying optimal correlation
metrics/scopes. Clustering analysis supports tailored quantitative strategies.
Our framework advances financial time-series prediction through dynamic
modeling and cross-asset interaction analysis.

TL;DR: KnoVo is a framework using LLMs to quantify research novelty by comparing papers along dynamic dimensions, aiding in tracking knowledge evolution and identifying gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional citation analysis lacks novelty assessment. KnoVo addresses this by evaluating relative novelty in citation networks.

Method: Uses LLMs to extract comparison dimensions (e.g., methodology) and compares papers via tournament-inspired analysis, generating novelty scores.

Result: Demonstrated on 20 diverse papers, showing performance of open-source LLMs in KnoVo.

Conclusion: KnoVo effectively assesses novelty, tracks knowledge evolution, and identifies research gaps, enhancing scientific literature analysis.

Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework
designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the
scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which
primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both
prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a
target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application,
dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these
same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament
selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative
improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific
aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for
instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo
facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar
work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions,
uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We
demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers
from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various
open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.

TL;DR: A proof-of-concept method for analyzing incunabula pages was developed, achieving high performance in object detection, OCR, and image classification, highlighting ML's potential for early printed books.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the analysis of incunabula pages' structure and content, leveraging machine learning for efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Used YOLO11n/s models for object detection on a custom dataset and DocLayNet, followed by OCR (Tesseract/Kraken) and image classification (ResNet18, CLIP).

Result: YOLO11n achieved F1=0.94 on custom data; Tesseract outperformed Kraken in OCR; ResNet18 achieved 98.7% accuracy in image classification.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows promise for incunabula analysis, but improvements in OCR and visual content interpretation are needed.

Abstract: We developed a proof-of-concept method for the automatic analysis of the
structure and content of incunabula pages. A custom dataset comprising 500
annotated pages from five different incunabula was created using resources from
the Jagiellonian Digital Library. Each page was manually labeled with five
predefined classes: Text, Title, Picture, Table, and Handwriting. Additionally,
the publicly available DocLayNet dataset was utilized as supplementary training
data. To perform object detection, YOLO11n and YOLO11s models were employed and
trained using two strategies: a combined dataset (DocLayNet and the custom
dataset) and the custom dataset alone. The highest performance (F1 = 0.94) was
achieved by the YOLO11n model trained exclusively on the custom data. Optical
character recognition was then conducted on regions classified as Text, using
both Tesseract and Kraken OCR, with Tesseract demonstrating superior results.
Subsequently, image classification was applied to the Picture class using a
ResNet18 model, achieving an accuracy of 98.7% across five subclasses:
Decorative_letter, Illustration, Other, Stamp, and Wrong_detection.
Furthermore, the CLIP model was utilized to generate semantic descriptions of
illustrations. The results confirm the potential of machine learning in the
analysis of early printed books, while emphasizing the need for further
advancements in OCR performance and visual content interpretation.

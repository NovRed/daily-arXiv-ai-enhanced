### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage is a novel method for verifying dataset ownership in image recognition models by embedding imperceptible traces in hard samples, balancing verification effectiveness and data integrity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns about unauthorized use of proprietary image datasets in AI models necessitate reliable ownership verification methods without compromising data integrity.

Method: HoneyImage selectively modifies hard samples to embed verifiable traces, ensuring minimal impact on dataset integrity and downstream performance.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets show HoneyImage achieves strong verification accuracy with imperceptible modifications and minimal performance impact.

Conclusion: HoneyImage offers a practical solution for data owners to protect dataset ownership, promoting safe sharing and leveraging AI's potential.

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg is a diffusion framework for joint synthesis of microstructure images and masks, improving segmentation accuracy by addressing data scarcity, especially for rare morphologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of human-annotated phase masks limits machine learning effectiveness in metallographic microstructure segmentation, particularly for rare or complex morphologies.

Method: PF-DiffSeg uses a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage denoising diffusion framework to jointly generate microstructure images and masks, conditioned on global phase-fraction vectors.

Result: The method improves segmentation accuracy, especially for minority classes, outperforms GAN baselines, and reduces inference time.

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg offers a scalable, unified solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

### [5] [Benefits of Feature Extraction and Temporal Sequence Analysis for Video Frame Prediction: An Evaluation of Hybrid Deep Learning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00898)
*Jose M. Sánchez Velázquez,Mingbo Cai,Andrew Coney,Álvaro J. García- Tejedor,Alberto Nogales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates hybrid deep learning models combining autoencoders with RNNs and 3D CNNs for video frame prediction, showing improved performance, especially with 3D CNNs and ConvLSTMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video frame prediction has critical applications in fields like weather forecasting and autonomous systems, but current models need improvement.

Method: Hybrid deep learning approaches combining autoencoders with RNNs and 3D CNNs were tested on diverse datasets.

Result: Performance improved, with SSIM metrics rising from 0.69 to 0.82, showing 3D CNNs and ConvLSTMs as most effective.

Conclusion: Hybrid models with 3D CNNs and ConvLSTMs are highly effective, especially for grayscale real-world videos.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC is a self-supervised pre-training framework for event-based perception, leveraging long-term temporal information to improve recurrent models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods for event-based pre-training ignore temporal information, limiting their effectiveness for recurrent models.

Method: TESPEC uses masked image modeling with a novel reconstruction target, accumulating events into pseudo grayscale videos for robust learning.

Result: TESPEC achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation.

Conclusion: TESPEC effectively bridges the gap between self-supervised pre-training and recurrent models for event-based perception.

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing

performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mismatched attention and suboptimal performance in VLMs by ensuring consistent cross-modal alignment.

Method: Proposes CCRA with LPWCA for regional-semantic correlations and PAI to coordinate attention mechanisms progressively.

Result: CCRA-enhanced LLaVA-v1.5-7B outperforms baselines on ten benchmarks with only 3.55M extra parameters.

Conclusion: CCRA enhances performance and interpretability in VLMs through consistent attention alignment.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To adapt infrared thermography for ergometer cycling by leveraging existing treadmill running data and improving deep neural network performance with minimal manual annotations.

Method: Transfer stereo- and multimodal-based labeling from treadmill to cycling, train a semantic segmentation network with automatic labels, and fine-tune with manual annotations. Compare dataset combinations.

Result: Fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data improves deep neural network performance. Combining automatic and manual labels accelerates adaptation to new use cases.

Conclusion: Combining automatic and minimal manual annotations efficiently adapts deep neural networks for new applications like transitioning from treadmill to cycling.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

### [10] [ROVI: A VLM-LLM Re-Captioned Dataset for Open-Vocabulary Instance-Grounded Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01008)
*Cihang Peng,Qiming Hou,Zhong Ren,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI is a synthetic dataset for text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M web images using a re-captioning strategy with VLM and LLM, outperforming existing datasets in quality and resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve instance-grounded text-to-image generation by creating a high-quality dataset with comprehensive visual descriptions and open-vocabulary categories.

Method: Uses re-captioning with VLM for visual descriptions and LLM for category extraction, processed by OVDs.

Result: ROVI exceeds existing datasets in quality, resolution, and category count. GLIGEN trained on ROVI outperforms alternatives in accuracy and quality.

Conclusion: ROVI provides a superior dataset for text-to-image generation, with open-vocabulary capabilities and high-quality outputs.

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at
https://github.com/CihangPeng/ROVI.

### [11] [AutoSIGHT: Automatic Eye Tracking-based System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01015)
*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSIGHT uses eye-tracking data to classify human expertise in visual tasks, achieving AUROC scores of 0.751 (5s window) and 0.8306 (30s window). It explores human-AI pairing dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the assessment of human expertise in visual tasks using eye-tracking data, enabling dynamic human-AI collaboration.

Method: AutoSIGHT employs an ensemble of features from eye-tracking data to classify experts and non-experts, tested on iris PAD tasks.

Result: AUROC scores of 0.751 (5s window) and 0.8306 (30s window) demonstrate viable expertise detection.

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT shows promise for human-AI pairing, with potential applications in dynamic expertise assessment.

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

### [12] [3D Reconstruction via Incremental Structure From Motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01019)
*Muhammad Zeeshan,Umer Zaki,Syed Ahmed Pasha,Zaar Khizar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper discusses incremental Structure from Motion (SfM) for 3D reconstruction, highlighting its flexibility and robustness in sparse datasets compared to global SfM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D reconstruction is crucial for robotics, mapping, and scene understanding, but global SfM struggles with noise or missing data. Incremental SfM offers a more adaptable solution.

Method: The paper details an incremental SfM pipeline, emphasizing geometric consistency and iterative refinement via bundle adjustment. It tests the method on a real dataset.

Result: The approach shows practical utility, with assessments based on reprojection error and camera trajectory coherence confirming reliable sparse 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: Incremental SfM is a robust method for 3D reconstruction in visually structured environments, especially where data is sparse or noisy.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

### [13] [Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Anomaly Classification in 3D Chest CT Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01045)
*Theo Di Piazza,Carole Lazarus,Olivier Nempont,Loic Boussel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A graph-based approach for multi-label classification of 3D CT scans is proposed, addressing limitations of 3D CNNs and Vision Transformers by leveraging spectral domain convolution on structured graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing workload of radiologists necessitates automated methods for CT scan analysis, but existing techniques struggle with long-range dependencies or high computational costs.

Method: The paper introduces a graph-based method modeling CT scans as structured graphs, using axial slice triplets and spectral domain convolution for improved anomaly classification.

Result: The approach shows strong cross-dataset generalization, competitive performance, and robustness to z-axis translation.

Conclusion: The proposed graph-based method offers an effective alternative for multi-label CT scan classification, balancing performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

*Hongyu Zhu,Sichu Liang,Wenwen Wang,Zhuomeng Zhang,Fangqi Li,Shi-Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified evasion framework to bypass Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) methods, outperforming existing attacks by leveraging task-relevant knowledge transfer using out-of-distribution datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DOV methods are evaluated with oversimplified evasion attacks, creating a false sense of security. The paper aims to expose vulnerabilities in current DOV approaches.

Method: A teacher model learns from the copyright dataset, then transfers task-relevant knowledge to a surrogate student using an OOD dataset. Vision-Language and Large Language Models curate informative subsets for effective transfer.

Result: The framework eliminates copyright identifiers and outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in generalization and effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead.

Conclusion: The study reveals key vulnerabilities in DOV methods, emphasizing the need for long-term improvements to enhance their practicality.

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Motivation: To improve asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation by evaluating and advancing 3D reconstruction techniques.

Method: Systematic analysis using 2D perceptual (image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics on custom datasets.

Result: Model performance is domain-dependent: better image quality for spacecraft, better shape accuracy for asteroids. Hunyuan-3D leads in both domains.

Conclusion: DreamSat-2.0 establishes new benchmarks, with Hunyuan-3D outperforming others, marking progress in 3D reconstruction for space applications.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

### [16] [COSTARR: Consolidated Open Set Technique with Attenuation for Robust Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01087)
*Ryan Rabinowitz,Steve Cruz,Walter Scheirer,Terrance E. Boult*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COSTARR improves open-set recognition by leveraging attenuated features, outperforming existing methods across various architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-set recognition methods rely on familiar features, missing the potential of attenuated features for novelty detection.

Method: COSTARR combines familiar features and attenuated features, with a probabilistic score for classification. Ablation studies validate the role of pre- and post-attenuated features.

Result: COSTARR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets like ImageNet2012-1K and others, generalizing well across architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, ResNet).

Conclusion: COSTARR advances open-set recognition by utilizing attenuated features, demonstrating significant performance improvements and generalization.

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current monitoring systems lack specificity in distinguishing smoke types and struggle with environmental variability, limiting their effectiveness.

*Yuekun Dai,Haitian Li,Shangchen Zhou,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter for diffusion-based inpainting models to handle RGBA images directly, addressing transparency consistency and edge quality issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inpainting methods are limited to RGB images, and conventional RGBA inpainting pipelines struggle with transparency consistency and edge quality.

Method: Introduces Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter for diffusion models, supporting controllable editing via ControlNet and integration with community models. Evaluated using LayerBench and a novel alpha edge quality metric.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in preserving transparency and improving edge quality in RGBA image inpainting.

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter successfully addresses transparency and edge quality challenges in RGBA image inpainting, offering a versatile solution.

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability to handle unknown materials. MASIV aims to overcome this by being material-agnostic.

Method: MASIV employs learnable neural constitutive models and dense geometric guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories.

Result: MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Conclusion: MASIV successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by being material-agnostic and leveraging dense geometric guidance.

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

TL;DR: The paper introduces EARL, an RL-based image editing model, and compares three strategies (SFT, RL, CoT) for performance enhancement, finding RL with a multi-modal LLM verifier most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance on diverse image editing tasks by exploring and comparing three strategies in a unified framework.

Method: Adopts an autoregressive multimodal model for unified processing of textual and visual tokens, testing SFT, RL, and CoT reasoning.

Result: RL combined with a multi-modal LLM verifier is most effective; EARL performs competitively with less training data.

Conclusion: EARL advances autoregressive multimodal models for image editing, with code and models publicly released.

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Egocentric Motion Generation and Forecasting tasks, proposing UniEgoMotion, a unified model for first-person motion synthesis using scene context from images, and a new dataset EE4D-Motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing AR/VR, human-robot interaction, assistive tech, and healthcare by improving egocentric motion prediction and simulation, addressing limitations of third-person methods.

Method: UniEgoMotion, a conditional motion diffusion model with head-centric motion representation, uses first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without explicit 3D scenes.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction; first model to generate motion from a single egocentric image.

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion sets a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling, enabling novel applications in AR/VR, robotics, and healthcare.

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

TL;DR: A semi-supervised anomaly detection framework using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for brain MRI and industrial datasets, achieving high AUROC scores and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance in anomaly detection, particularly for brain MRI volumes.

Method: Integrates DRL with feature representations, preprocessing (normalization, skull-stripping, co-registering), and uses datasets (IXI, BraTS 2021, MVTec AD) for validation.

Result: Achieved AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7% (image-level) on brain MRI, and 99.8% (pixel-level) and 99.3% (image-level) on industrial datasets, outperforming SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The domain-agnostic DRL approach is robust, generalizable, and efficient, showing promise for real-world clinical and industrial applications.

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

### [23] [Dataset Condensation with Color Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01139)
*Huyu Wu,Duo Su,Junjie Hou,Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC3 improves dataset condensation by addressing color's dual role, using a latent diffusion model for color compensation, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with inefficiency or semantic distortion; DC3 focuses on enhancing color diversity for better representation learning.

Method: DC3 uses a calibrated selection strategy and a latent diffusion model to enhance color diversity in condensed images.

Result: DC3 outperforms SOTA methods across benchmarks, proving feasibility of training with high-quality condensed datasets.

Conclusion: DC3 successfully addresses dataset condensation challenges, offering superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Method: The framework integrates 3D Gaussian representation and a Truncated Signed Distance Field for semantic feature fusion. It also uses MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding for refined object segmentation.

Result: Achieves a 17% improvement in 3D mIoU over fixed threshold strategies and outperforms existing methods in scene reconstruction and interaction.

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion advances open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding, demonstrating superior performance in semantic modeling and language-guided interaction.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its

TL;DR: Proposes Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA) for text-to-image diffusion models, allowing user-specific safety control while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety mechanisms lack personalization, ignoring diverse user preferences shaped by age, mental health, and beliefs.

Method: Introduces PSA framework with personalized user profiles integrated via cross-attention, tested on the Sage dataset.

Result: PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate.

Conclusion: PSA effectively personalizes safety in generative models, balancing user preferences and content quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,

TL;DR: LawDIS is a controllable dichotomous image segmentation framework using language and window controls for high-quality mask generation, outperforming 11 state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object mask quality and user control in image segmentation by integrating language prompts and adjustable windows.

Method: Uses a latent diffusion model with macro (language-controlled segmentation) and micro (window-controlled refinement) modes, coordinated by a mode switcher.

Result: Significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods, achieving F_β^ω gains of 4.6% with both strategies and 3.6% with LS alone on DIS-TE.

Conclusion: LawDIS is effective for high-accuracy, personalized segmentation tasks, with code available for public use.

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STR is challenging due to complex visuals and limited semantic priors. TEACH aims to improve accuracy without external pretraining or inference overhead.

Method: TEACH injects ground-truth text as auxiliary input, encodes labels into embeddings, and uses loss-aware masking to simulate curriculum learning.

Result: Experiments show TEACH improves accuracy across benchmarks, especially in challenging conditions.

Conclusion: TEACH is robust, model-agnostic, and enhances STR performance without added complexity.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dense long-term 3D point tracking are computationally expensive, especially with transformer-based iterative tracking and correlation feature computation.

Method: Introduces a coarse-to-fine strategy with a learnable interpolation module and optimizes correlation feature computation.

Result: Achieves a 5-100x speedup over prior methods while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm effectively addresses computational bottlenecks, enabling faster and accurate 3D point tracking.

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPFSplat is a framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images without ground-truth poses, achieving state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient 3D Gaussian splatting without requiring ground-truth poses during training or inference, addressing practical challenges in novel view synthesis and pose estimation.

Method: Uses a shared feature extraction backbone to predict 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space in one feed-forward step, with rendering and reprojection losses for geometric constraints.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis under significant viewpoint changes and limited overlap, and outperforms methods with geometry priors in pose estimation.

Conclusion: SPFSplat's pose-free training and efficient design make it practical and effective for 3D Gaussian splatting tasks.

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

*Xinhang Wan,Dongqiang Gou,Xinwang Liu,En Zhu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel approach for 3D affordance grounding and classification in Embodied AI, addressing inconsistencies and scale issues by learning an affordance-aware 3D representation and using a stage-wise inference strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve object manipulation learning in Embodied AI by addressing the lack of dependency modeling between affordance grounding and classification, and the limitations of incomplete and fixed-scale predictions.

Method: Develops a cross-modal 3D representation with efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, and employs a two-stage prediction mechanism to couple grounding and classification tasks.

Result: Experiments show improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of affordance understanding by leveraging dependency modeling and multi-scale features, enhancing performance in both grounding and classification.

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual grounding tasks rely on bounding boxes, which lack fine-grained details and accuracy in object representation.

Method: GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model, integrates visual, textual, and point cloud features for voxel-wise predictions and refined localization, aided by 2D grounding and depth estimation modules.

Result: GroundingOcc outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding, demonstrating improved precision.

Conclusion: The benchmark and GroundingOcc model advance 3D occupancy grounding, offering more accurate object perception for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

TL;DR: The paper explores using satellite images and deep learning for cost-effective pavement condition evaluation, achieving over 90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional infrastructure inspection methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming, prompting the need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Deep learning models were applied to analyze over 3,000 satellite images of pavement sections, paired with evaluation ratings from TxDOT's PMIS database.

Result: The study achieved an accuracy rate exceeding 90% in evaluating pavement conditions.

Conclusion: This research offers a rapid, cost-effective future approach for pavement network evaluation.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

*Tianze Wang,Zhang Zhang,Chao Yue,Nuoran Li,Chao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RoadMamba, a method combining local and global perception for road surface classification using visual Mamba architectures, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving autonomous vehicle safety and comfort by accurately classifying road surface conditions using visual technologies.

Method: Proposes RoadMamba, utilizing Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) for global and local feature extraction and Dual Attention Fusion (DAF) for feature decoding. Includes a dual auxiliary loss to balance feature reliance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on a dataset with 1 million samples.

Conclusion: RoadMamba effectively combines local and global perception for superior road surface classification, benefiting autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

### [34] [StyDeco: Unsupervised Style Transfer with Distilling Priors and Semantic Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01215)
*Yuanlin Yang,Quanjian Song,Zhexian Gao,Ge Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaoyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco is an unsupervised framework for style transfer that addresses the semantic gap in text-driven diffusion models by learning tailored text representations, outperforming existing methods in fidelity and structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-driven diffusion models treat textual descriptions uniformly, ignoring the spatial-semantic gap in style transfer, leading to loss of fine-grained details.

Method: StyDeco uses Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD) for unsupervised stylistic knowledge distillation and Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD) to adapt text encoders with domain-specific weights.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods on benchmarks, achieving better stylistic fidelity and structural preservation, and supports de-stylization.

Conclusion: StyDeco effectively bridges the semantic gap in text-driven style transfer, offering improved performance and extensibility.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

### [35] [Perspective from a Broader Context: Can Room Style Knowledge Help Visual Floorplan Localization?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01216)
*Bolei Chen,Shengsheng Yan,Yongzheng Cui,Jiaxu Kang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an unsupervised learning technique to enhance visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) by leveraging scene context from room images, improving robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FLoc methods rely on 2D structural cues or 3D geometry, ignoring richer visual context, leading to ambiguous localization.

Method: An unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints pre-trains a room discriminator to extract room types from images, injecting this context into FLoc algorithms.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks, showing significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Incorporating scene context via unsupervised learning effectively eliminates localization uncertainty in FLoc.

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGaFace improves 3D head avatar reconstruction by refining geometry and texture during Gaussian rendering, addressing misalignment issues with a momentum-guided module and latent texture attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, leading to poor rendering quality and loss of fine details.

Method: Introduces Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry for temporal/multi-view consistency and Latent Texture Attention for geometry-aware texture refinement.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity reconstruction and better novel-view synthesis, even with inaccurate mesh initialization.

Conclusion: MoGaFace outperforms existing methods by refining geometry and texture continuously during rendering.

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes weights in an orthonormal eigenbasis to improve feature clarity and learning dynamics. ENN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image classification and cross-modal retrieval, and its BP-free variant, ENN-ℓ, achieves faster training and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the disordered weight structures in DNNs caused by gradient-based optimization, which harm feature clarity and learning dynamics.

Method: ENN reparameterizes each layer's weights in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis, enforcing decorrelated and well-aligned weight dynamics. It also introduces a BP-free variant, ENN-ℓ, for efficient local learning.

Result: ENN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and sets a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. ENN-ℓ achieves over 2× training speedup and surpasses end-to-end backpropagation accuracy.

Conclusion: ENN addresses representational deficiencies of BP, enhancing performance and enabling efficient, parallelizable training.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Motivation: Overcome the high latency of strictly sequential computation in reversible spiking neural networks (RevSNNs).

Method: Proposes ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks.

Result: Matches or exceeds RevSNN accuracy, reduces training time by up to 35.2%, and inference time to 18.15%.

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN is efficient for resource-constrained scenarios, balancing speed and memory benefits.

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MCP and MCP++, multi-cache enhanced prototype-based test-time adaptation methods, improving generalization performance by addressing unreliable low-entropy samples and ensuring intra-class compactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on low-entropy samples, which may be unreliable under distribution shifts, leading to non-compact intra-class distributions.

Method: Introduces MCP with three caches (entropy, align, negative) and MCP++ with cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively enhance generalization by improving intra-class compactness and prototype reliability.

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

TL;DR: A multi-view open-set learning framework is proposed to address class incompleteness and view-induced biases, using ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view learning models fail in open-set scenarios due to class incompleteness assumptions and static view-induced biases.

Method: The framework includes O-Mix for generating ambiguous samples, an ambiguity perception network, and an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module.

Result: The framework improves unknown-class recognition while maintaining strong closed-set performance on multi-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively handles open-set challenges and view biases, enhancing generalization in multi-view learning.

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

*Mingyu Fu,Wei Suo,Ji Ma,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Peng Wang,Yanning Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACCM reduces computational costs in LVLMs by compensating for visual information loss with adaptive captions, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational costs of LVLMs due to long visual sequences limit their applications, and existing pruning methods degrade performance.

Method: ACCM uses a lightweight caption model and selector to generate and choose relevant captions, trained via self-supervised learning.

Result: ACCM surpasses SOTA by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: ACCM effectively mitigates visual information loss and reduces computational costs, enhancing LVLM efficiency.

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

TL;DR: OCSplats is a novel framework for anti-noise 3D reconstruction using 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving noise classification and reconstruction accuracy without scene-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in real-world 3D reconstruction (e.g., moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces) causes errors, and existing methods lack effective separation or require impractical fine-tuning.

Method: Proposes OCSplats, combining hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive correction, with a dynamic anchor point pipeline for noise classification.

Result: OCSplats achieves leading reconstruction performance and precise noise classification across diverse scenarios without parameter adjustments.

Conclusion: OCSplats effectively addresses label noise in 3DGS, offering robust and adaptable reconstruction without scene-specific tuning.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NS-Net improves AI-generated image detection by decoupling semantic info from CLIP features, achieving 7.4% higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Concerns over misuse of realistic AI-generated images and limitations of current detectors in generalizing to unknown models.

Method: Proposes NS-Net, using NULL-Space projection and contrastive learning, plus Patch Selection for fine-grained artifact preservation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.4% on a benchmark with 40 generative models.

Conclusion: NS-Net demonstrates strong generalization across GAN- and diffusion-based techniques.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP) to reduce annotation costs by using weak supervision like image-level labels and natural language descriptions. It proposes DisFaceRep, a framework to disentangle co-occurring facial components, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face parsing methods require expensive dense pixel-level annotations. WSFP aims to reduce this cost by leveraging weak supervision.

Method: DisFaceRep disentangles co-occurring facial components using explicit (co-occurring component disentanglement) and implicit (text-guided component disentanglement loss) mechanisms.

Result: DisFaceRep significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods on datasets like CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen.

Conclusion: WSFP is challenging but feasible with DisFaceRep, which effectively leverages weak supervision for accurate face parsing.

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be

Motivation: To tackle real-world object detection challenges involving domain and category shifts, ensuring adaptability.

Method: Uses large language models for domain-agnostic text prompts and learns domain embeddings from images, integrating them for customized embeddings.

Result: The OD-LVIS benchmark (46,949 images, 18 domains, 1,203 categories) and proposed method show superior performance.

Conclusion: The work validates ODOV detection, the benchmark's utility, and the method's effectiveness.

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a self-enhanced framework for image clustering using cross-modal semantic consistency to improve task-specific performance by fine-tuning the encoder, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods freeze the encoder in large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP, creating a mismatch between generic features and task-specific clustering demands, limiting performance.

Method: The framework uses cross-modal semantic consistency to align clustering heads with pre-trained model semantics, followed by self-enhanced fine-tuning using pseudo-labels for joint optimization of the encoder and clustering heads.

Result: The method outperforms existing deep clustering methods on six datasets, with a ViT-B/32 model matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods using larger models like ViT-L/14.

Conclusion: The proposed self-enhanced framework effectively bridges the gap between generic pre-trained features and task-specific clustering needs, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

### [47] [SpatioTemporal Difference Network for Video Depth Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01259)
*Zhengxue Wang,Yuan Wu,Xiang Li,Zhiqiang Yan,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes STDNet, a SpatioTemporal Difference Network, to address long-tailed distribution issues in video depth super-resolution by leveraging spatial and temporal difference mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video depth super-resolution suffers from long-tailed distributions in spatial non-smooth regions and temporal variation zones, which degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: STDNet includes a spatial difference branch for intra-frame RGB-D aggregation and a temporal difference branch for motion compensation using temporal variation information.

Result: STDNet outperforms existing methods across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed STDNet successfully mitigates long-tailed effects in video depth super-resolution, improving reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

*Lexiao Zou,Gongwei Chen,Yanda Chen,Miao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACS improves dataset distillation by using adversarial-guided curriculum sampling to enhance diversity and efficiency in distilled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation and lack of diversity in dataset distillation, especially with larger datasets or higher resolutions.

Method: Proposes Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the dataset into curricula and uses adversarial loss to guide diffusion sampling, ensuring diversity and systematic coverage.

Result: Achieves improvements of 4.1% on Imagewoof and 2.1% on ImageNet-1k over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ACS effectively mitigates information redundancy and enhances dataset distillation performance.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

*Pedro Alonso,Tianrui Li,Chongshou Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ModelNet40-E is a new benchmark for evaluating point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like noise, including noise-corrupted data and uncertainty annotations. Point Transformer v3 shows better calibration under noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess robustness and calibration of point cloud models under noise, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Method: Introduces ModelNet40-E with noise-corrupted point clouds and uncertainty annotations. Evaluates PointNet, DGCNN, and Point Transformer v3 using accuracy, calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness.

Result: All models degrade with noise, but Point Transformer v3 outperforms in calibration, aligning uncertainties with measurement noise.

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E enables fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty modeling, with Point Transformer v3 demonstrating superior calibration under noise.

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

### [50] [SGCap: Decoding Semantic Group for Zero-shot Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01270)
*Zeyu Pan,Ping Li,Wenxiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGCap introduces Semantic Group Captioning for zero-shot video captioning, addressing temporal dynamics and enhancing generalization with novel modules like SGD, KSS, and PSS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot image captioning methods fail to capture video temporal dynamics and lack sufficient video-level supervision.

Method: Proposes SGCap with Semantic Group Decoding (SGD), Key Sentences Selection (KSS), and Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) to model inter-frame relationships and enhance generalization.

Result: SGCap outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods and competes with fully supervised ones on benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGCap effectively addresses zero-shot video captioning challenges, offering superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

*Zonglei Jing,Xiao Yang,Xiaoqian Li,Siyuan Liang,Aishan Liu,Mingchuan Zhang,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptSafe is a gated prompt tuning framework for T2I models to prevent NSFW content, balancing safety and image quality by adapting defensive strength based on prompt toxicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models often produce NSFW content, and existing defenses are computationally expensive, degrade image quality, and lack adaptability to diverse safety needs.

Method: Uses a text-only training corpus from rewritten safe prompts, optimizes a universal soft prompt, and employs a gated control network to adjust defense intensity.

Result: Achieves a 2.36% unsafe generation rate, preserves benign image quality, and generalizes well to unseen harmful categories and model architectures.

Conclusion: PromptSafe offers a practical, scalable solution for safe T2I generation with strong performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

### [52] [Integrating Disparity Confidence Estimation into Relative Depth Prior-Guided Unsupervised Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01275)
*Chuang-Wei Liu,Mingjian Sun,Cairong Zhao,Hanli Wang,Alexander Dvorkovich,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised stereo matching framework using disparity confidence estimation and depth prior-guided loss functions to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in unsupervised stereo matching, such as ambiguities from repetitive patterns and texture-less regions, by leveraging 3D geometric knowledge.

Method: Introduces a disparity confidence estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions to enhance learning from quasi-dense correspondences.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on KITTI Stereo benchmarks among unsupervised methods.

Conclusion: The framework effectively improves stereo matching by efficiently utilizing 3D geometric knowledge and reducing noise from disparity estimates.

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

*Ngoc Bui Lam Quang,Nam Le Nguyen Binh,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Le Thien Phuc Nguyen,Quan Nguyen,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-language MIL framework improves WSI classification by using multi-agent description generation and a list-based text encoding strategy for better alignment with visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MIL methods for WSI classification using VLMs are limited by token capacity and lack domain-specific grounding in generated descriptions, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes a grounded multi-agent system for generating diverse clinical descriptions and a list-based text encoding strategy to enhance alignment with visual features.

Result: Outperforms single-prompt baselines and matches state-of-the-art models on renal and lung cancer datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, improving classification accuracy through richer and more accurate clinical descriptions.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

*Shuangli Du,Jing Wang,Minghua Zhao,Zhenyu Xu,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data augmentation (UgDA) method to improve stereo matching models' generalization by perturbing RGB image statistics to simulate unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stereo matching models trained on synthetic data struggle with real-world domain differences like color and texture.

Method: UgDA perturbs RGB image statistics (mean, standard deviation) and uses Gaussian distributions to model uncertainty in perturbation. It enforces feature consistency between original and augmented data.

Result: The method significantly improves generalization of stereo matching networks on benchmarks.

Conclusion: UgDA is a simple, architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing cross-domain feature learning in stereo matching.

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes C3D-AD, a continual learning framework for 3D anomaly detection, handling new classes over time with Kernel Attention and representation rehearsal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D AD methods lack generalization across classes and adaptability to new emerging classes.

Method: Uses Kernel Attention Layers (KAL) for feature extraction, Kernel Attention with Advisor (KAA) for reconstruction, and Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) for consistency.

Result: Achieves 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD datasets.

Conclusion: C3D-AD effectively generalizes across classes and adapts to new ones, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

TL;DR: A novel multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture improves distal myopathy diagnosis by combining global and local deep learning features, enhancing accuracy and interpretability, though gaps in clinical specificity remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnosing distal myopathy is challenging due to its genetic heterogeneity and varied clinical manifestations. The study aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and interpretability in radiology.

Method: The proposed method integrates features from two deep learning models (global and local) using an attention gate mechanism, evaluated on BUSI and a proprietary dataset.

Result: Achieves high classification accuracy and generates clinically relevant saliency maps, but gaps in anatomical specificity and clinical usefulness persist.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for richer interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to meet real-world clinical expectations.

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSINet, a unified segmentation framework for RRSIS, addressing scale variation issues by integrating cross-view semantics and collaborative attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with tiny, ambiguous targets in remote sensing due to single-view structures. Inspired by human observation, the paper aims to enhance global and local semantics.

Method: CSINet uses a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) for global-local semantics integration and a Collaboratively Dilated Attention Decoder (CDAD) for multiscale feature fusion.

Result: The framework significantly improves segmentation accuracy while maintaining speed.

Conclusion: CSINet effectively addresses scale variation and semantic integration challenges in RRSIS, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of labeled dermatological datasets and provide a scalable, flexible tool for erythema detection without annotated training masks.

Method: Uses edit-friendly inversion in diffusion models to synthesize reference images free from erythema, aligns them with original images, and performs color-space analysis with minimal user intervention.

Result: Successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, outperforming baseline threshold-based techniques.

Conclusion: Combining generative diffusion models and color segmentation enables efficient erythema detection without prior training data, promising for computer-aided dermatology.

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

TL;DR: StyleSentinel protects artwork copyright by verifying stylistic fingerprints, outperforming existing methods in one-sample verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unauthorized use of personal artwork via diffusion models threatens artists' intellectual property, and current defenses like watermarks are inadequate.

Method: StyleSentinel uses semantic self-reconstruction for stylistic expressiveness, fuses multi-layer features for a stylistic fingerprint, and models style as a hypersphere boundary for verification.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in one-sample verification and proves effective on online platforms.

Conclusion: StyleSentinel offers a robust solution for copyright protection by leveraging inherent stylistic features.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

*Ziqi Sheng,Junyan Wu,Wei Lu,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLaCo is a vision-language framework for weakly supervised image forgery localization, leveraging pre-trained VLMs for semantic guidance and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited performance of weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL) methods by introducing semantic supervision from pre-trained VLMs.

Method: ViLaCo uses a vision-language feature modeling network, adaptive reasoning network, dual prediction heads, and a contrastive patch consistency module for localization.

Result: ViLaCo outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in detection and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: ViLaCo effectively bridges the gap between weak supervision and fine-grained localization, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in

Abstract: With increasing demand for ride comfort in new energy vehicles, accurate
real-time detection of speed bumps and potholes is critical for predictive
suspension control. This paper proposes SBP-YOLO, a lightweight detection
framework based on YOLOv11, optimized for embedded deployment. The model
integrates GhostConv for efficient computation, VoVGSCSPC for multi-scale

reduce early-stage feature processing costs. A hybrid training strategy
combining NWD loss, knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based weather
augmentation improves detection robustness, especially for small and distant
targets. Experiments show SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP (outperforming YOLOv11n

*Rongzhen Zhao,Jian Li,Juho Kannala,Joni Pajarinen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RandSF.Q improves video Object-Centric Learning by incorporating next-frame features and learning transition dynamics, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video OCL methods lack next-frame feature incorporation and fail to learn transition dynamics, limiting query prediction.

Method: Proposes RandSF.Q: a transitioner using slots and features for query prediction, trained with random slot-feature pairs to learn dynamics.

Result: Achieves up to 10-point improvement in object discovery and benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling.

Conclusion: RandSF.Q sets a new state-of-the-art in video OCL by addressing key limitations of current methods.

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using vision-language models (VLMs) to improve damage assessment in HADR by addressing data imbalance and labeling inaccuracies, showing promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for HADR damage assessment struggle with data imbalance, lack of moderate damage examples, and human labeling errors.

Method: Leverages VLMs to fuse imagery with human knowledge, generating diverse damage data for better generalization.

Result: Initial experiments show improved classification of structural damage levels in buildings, roads, and infrastructure.

Conclusion: VLMs offer a viable solution to enhance damage assessment accuracy in HADR scenarios.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in
humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning
approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data
classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel
labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and
exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse
imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate
a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial
experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which
demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of
structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

*Qiang Guo,Rubo Zhang,Bingbing Zhang,Junjie Liu,Jianqing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Full-stage Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm to reduce false positives in pedestrian detection by refining proposals during training and testing stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: False positives in pedestrian detection remain unresolved, prompting the need for an effective solution.

Method: The FRP algorithm uses pedestrian feature re-evaluation strategies, including TFRP for training, and CFRP and SFRP for inference, to filter low-quality proposals.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks and SY-Metro datasets show the algorithm effectively reduces false positives and improves detection on edge devices.

Conclusion: The FRP algorithm enhances pedestrian detection by suppressing false positives across all stages, proving effective in various scenarios.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fast Window Attention (FWA), a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature map sizes, and proposes LOLViT, a hybrid backbone network combining FWA with GhostNet, achieving superior speed and accuracy over CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational imbalance between CNNs and attention mechanisms in hybrid models, particularly for long-sequence modeling, and resolve issues like fixed-size feature map reduction and computational saturation.

Method: Proposes FWA for adaptive feature map sizes and window aggregation, uses ReLU to simulate SoftMax in lightweight attention, and integrates FWA with GhostNet to create LOLViT.

Result: LOLViT outperforms same-level CNNs in speed and accuracy, with LOLViT-X being 5x faster than MobileViT-X on tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: FWA and LOLViT effectively balance computational efficiency and performance, offering a practical solution for lightweight hybrid models.

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

### [67] [Construction of Digital Terrain Maps from Multi-view Satellite Imagery using Neural Volume Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01386)
*Josef X. Biberstein,Guilherme Cavalheiro,Juyeop Han,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Neural Terrain Maps (NTM), a method using neural volume rendering to create high-quality digital terrain maps from satellite imagery without relying on depth or structural priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for producing digital terrain maps (DTMs) are cumbersome and require manual preprocessing. The need for better DTMs is growing with more ambitious robotic exploration missions.

Method: NTM learns textured DTMs directly from satellite imagery using neural volume rendering, requiring only the locus for each image pixel.

Result: Tested on synthetic and real satellite data, NTM achieves terrain prediction precision nearly matching the resolution of satellite images, even with imperfect camera parameters.

Conclusion: NTM offers a promising alternative to traditional multi-view stereo pipelines for generating high-quality DTMs.

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

*Pouya Parsa,Keya Li,Kara M. Kockelman,Seongjin Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using vision-language models (VLMs) for automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make/model recognition in videos from handheld or non-static cameras, achieving high accuracy and cost-effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges like camera motion and occlusions in non-static ALPR and vehicle recognition, leveraging VLMs for scalable solutions.

Method: Proposes pipelines for ALPR and make/model recognition using VLMs with multimodal prompts and a self-reflection module for corrections.

Result: Achieves 91.67% ALPR and 66.67% make/model accuracy on a smartphone dataset, with improvements via self-reflection.

Conclusion: VLMs offer a scalable, cost-effective solution for in-motion traffic video analysis.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

*Minjeong Park,Hongbeen Park,Sangwon Lee,Yoonha Jang,Jinkyu Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval (OAPR) to handle novel attributes in real-world scenarios, proposing a framework for generalizable body part representations and reconstructing datasets for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PAR methods assume closed-set attributes, limiting real-world applicability where new attributes emerge. Predefined attributes are also less discriminative for person retrieval.

Method: Proposes OAPR task and a framework to learn generalizable body part representations. Reconstructs four datasets for open-attribute recognition.

Result: Experiments validate the necessity of OAPR and the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The OAPR task addresses limitations of closed-set PAR, with the proposed framework showing promise for real-world applications.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

*Zhuohua Ye,Liming Zhang,Hongru Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFAE enhances RAW image object detection by combining spatial and frequency domain representations, preserving details through spatialized frequency bands and cross-domain fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW data's wide dynamic range and linear response suppress object details, which spatial-domain methods struggle to recover.

Method: SFAE spatializes frequency bands, uses cross-domain fusion attention, and applies adaptive nonlinear adjustments.

Result: Improved object detection by effectively recovering suppressed details in RAW images.

Conclusion: SFAE's spatial-frequency synergy offers a robust solution for RAW-based object detection.

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

TL;DR: ForenX is a novel method using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to detect and explain AI-generated images, outperforming classifiers by aligning with human forensic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between AI-generated image detection methods and human cognitive forensic analysis drives the need for a more interpretable and accurate approach.

Method: ForenX employs MLLMs with a specialized forensic prompt to detect forgeries and provide human-like explanations, supported by the ForgReason dataset.

Result: ForenX enhances generalization and explanation quality, validated on benchmarks and subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: ForenX bridges the gap between AI and human forensic analysis, offering accurate detection and interpretable explanations.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

*Shitian Yang,Deyu Li,Xiaoke Jiang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DRot is a plug-and-play augmentation method for RGB-based 3D tasks that preserves geometric consistency by rotating/mirroring images about the camera's optical center, improving performance metrics like IoU and mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based 3D tasks face challenges due to scarce annotations and limited augmentation options, as traditional transforms disrupt geometric consistency.

Method: 3DRot rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to maintain projective geometry.

Result: On SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot improves IoU3D from 43.21 to 44.51, reduces rotation error from 22.91° to 20.93°, and increases mAP0.5 from 35.70 to 38.11.

Conclusion: 3DRot is effective for monocular 3D detection and can be easily adapted to other 3D tasks due to its camera-space transform approach.

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

TL;DR: SPECTRUM is a temporal-frequency synergistic model for online handwriting verification, combining temporal and frequency features for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unlock the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning in online handwriting verification (OHV) by integrating temporal and frequency features.

Method: SPECTRUM uses a multi-scale interactor, self-gated fusion module, and multi-domain distance-based verifier to synergistically combine temporal and frequency features.

Result: SPECTRUM outperforms existing OHV methods, showing the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning.

Conclusion: Multi-domain learning enhances handwriting verification, paving the way for future research in multi-domain approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

*Zhuoran Peng,Yiqing Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-granularity tensor decomposition model for HSI recovery, addressing limitations of fixed-format non-local priors by alternating coarse-grained (Tucker) and fine-grained (FCTN) decompositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HSI recovery methods use fixed non-local priors, limiting adaptability to diverse missing scenarios.

Method: Alternates coarse-grained (Tucker) and fine-grained (FCTN) tensor decompositions to capture global and local details.

Result: The model shows strong applicability and outperforms in various missing scenarios (pixels, stripes).

Conclusion: The multi-granularity approach unifies global, local, and non-local priors, enhancing HSI recovery.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

TL;DR: A novel framework predicts segmentation quality without ground truth annotations, using uncertainty maps and predicted segmentations, outperforming prior methods on 2D and 3D datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical settings lack manual annotations for segmentation quality assessment, hindering model adoption.

Method: Proposes two frameworks: one uses predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, the other integrates input images, uncertainty, and segmentations. Bayesian adaptations of SwinUNet and FPN with ResNet50 are used, with uncertainty quantified via Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation.

Result: Achieves high R2 scores (93.25) and Pearson correlations (96.58) on HAM10000, and robust performance on 3D liver segmentation. Aggregates uncertainty estimates for comprehensive quality assessment.

Conclusion: The framework effectively predicts segmentation quality without ground truth, with cross-modality robustness and interpretability via Grad-CAM and UMAP.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Method: Introduces Can3Tok, a VAE for encoding Gaussian primitives, and a pipeline for 3D scene data processing to handle scale inconsistency.

Result: Validated on DL3DV-10K, Can3Tok generalizes to novel scenes, unlike other methods that fail to converge or generalize.

Conclusion: Can3Tok enables downstream tasks like image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation, advancing scene-level 3D generation.

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

TL;DR: EfficientGFormer integrates pretrained models, graph reasoning, and efficiency mechanisms for fast, accurate 3D brain tumor segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of heterogeneous tumor subregions and high computational costs in neuroimaging.

Method: Combines nnFormer for modality-aware encoding, dual-edge graph for spatial/semantic features, pruned GAT for reasoning, and distillation for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced memory and inference time on MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable, interpretable, and generalizable solution for clinical tumor delineation.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and
graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast
and accurate volumetric tumor delineation, combining scalability,
interpretability, and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MiraGe is a method for detecting AI-generated images by learning generator-invariant features, improving generalizability across unseen models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing detectors struggle with new or unseen generative models due to overlapping features. MiraGe addresses this by minimizing intra-class variation and maximizing inter-class separation.

Method: MiraGe uses multimodal prompt learning to refine CLIP embeddings, aligning features within classes and separating them between classes.

Result: MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, even against unseen generators like Sora.

Conclusion: MiraGe enhances generalizability in AI-generated image detection by leveraging multimodal discriminative representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small-scale models struggle with fine-grained temporal reasoning in video understanding, necessitating enhanced methods.

Method: Three-stage training: text-only reasoning, video fine-tuning, and temporal-aware reinforcement learning with T-GRPO and sub-action decomposition.

Result: Achieves 67.2%, 94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, with notable improvements over baselines.

Conclusion: Progressive training enables competitive performance in small models while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,
15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our
progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive
video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high computational and storage demands of VLMs hinder their deployment on mobile devices, which are the most accessible computing platforms.

Method: MagicVL-2B uses a lightweight visual encoder (<100M parameters), a dynamic resolution scheme, and multimodal curriculum learning to enhance performance.

Result: The model matches state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmarks while reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%.

Conclusion: MagicVL-2B is a practical solution for mobile vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence on smartphones.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile
vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run
directly on smartphones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-VRAG is a novel video RAG framework that improves efficiency and accuracy in video understanding by combining hierarchical frame pre-filtering, lightweight VLM scoring, and multi-view question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs face limitations in processing long videos due to high computational costs and restricted context windows, while existing RAG methods struggle with balancing retrieval efficiency and accuracy.

Method: E-VRAG uses hierarchical query decomposition for frame pre-filtering, a lightweight VLM for scoring, and a global statistical distribution-based retrieval strategy. It also employs a multi-view QA scheme.

Result: E-VRAG reduces computational costs by ~70% and achieves higher accuracy than baselines on four benchmarks, without additional training.

Conclusion: E-VRAG effectively enhances efficiency and accuracy in video RAG tasks, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GlimpsePrune dynamically prunes visual tokens in LVLMs, retaining performance while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed compression ratios in LVLMs lead to imprecise pruning and degraded performance.

Method: Introduces GlimpsePrune, a dynamic pruning framework inspired by human cognition, which prunes irrelevant tokens in one forward pass.

Result: Prunes 92.6% of tokens while maintaining baseline performance; GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of baseline performance.

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune enables more efficient and powerful LVLMs.

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM adaptation methods are manually designed, requiring expertise and time. Automating this process can enhance efficiency and performance.

Method: A two-stage LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm optimizes feature selection and logits computation, using divide-and-conquer to manage the search space. Low-precision code conversion and web-based execution improve stability.

Result: EvoVLMA improves the APE algorithm by 1.91 points in 8-shot image classification accuracy.

Conclusion: EvoVLMA demonstrates the potential for automating adaptation algorithm design for pre-trained multimodal models, offering better performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

TL;DR: A predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework reduces LiDAR energy consumption by 65% while maintaining 3D object detection performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LiDAR sensors ignore temporal continuity, causing redundancy and high power consumption, limiting practicality on resource-constrained platforms.

Method: Uses a lightweight predictor network and differentiable Mask Generator with Gumbel-Softmax sampling to identify critical ROIs for adaptive scanning.

Result: Reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining or improving detection performance on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently balances energy savings and detection accuracy, enhancing LiDAR-camera fusion practicality.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

TL;DR: LetheViT is a contrastive unlearning method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that addresses privacy compliance by enabling selective data forgetting while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA require models to forget user data upon request, posing challenges for ViTs. Machine unlearning is needed to remove data influence without retraining.

Method: LetheViT uses masked and original image inputs to generate positive and negative logits, guiding the model to forget specific details while retaining general class outlines.

Result: LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, balancing privacy compliance and model efficacy.

Conclusion: LetheViT effectively addresses the challenge of random data forgetting in ViTs, ensuring privacy compliance without compromising performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TopoImages, a method to encode local topological structures in images using persistent homology, enhancing deep learning frameworks for improved classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image processing methods often overlook topological structures, which are crucial for understanding image content, especially in biomedical applications.

Method: The approach involves computing persistence diagrams of image patches, vectorizing them into TopoImages, and generating multi-view TopoImages using various filtration functions for fusion with input images in DL frameworks.

Result: Experiments on medical image datasets show significant accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TopoImages provide a versatile and effective way to integrate topological information into DL frameworks, enhancing classification performance.

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore CLIP's textual semantic priors for continual learning, mitigating interference from unrelated tasks and bridging the modality gap in CLIP.

Method: Proposes SECA with SG-AKT for semantic-aware knowledge transfer and SE-VPR for refining visual prototypes using textual embeddings.

Result: Validated on multiple benchmarks, SECA effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning.

Conclusion: SECA demonstrates the potential of textual semantics in CLIP for improving continual learning performance.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Set Pivot Learning (SPL), a new domain generalization paradigm leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), focusing on dynamic adaptation and VFM-centric tuning for better real-world alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional domain generalization assumes inaccessible target domains, but VFMs challenge this. SPL addresses this by redefining domain migration tasks for modern needs.

Method: SPL emphasizes dynamic adaptation and VFM-centric tuning. A Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method is proposed, combining Dynamic Class-aware Prompter and Prompt-guided Feature Focuser.

Result: Experiments show SPL's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, especially in generalized segmentation.

Conclusion: SPL offers a more adaptive and robust approach to domain generalization, aligning better with evolving real-world conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STCN is a novel two-stage method for stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, addressing mode collapse and improving flexibility in motion sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with learning continuous temporal dynamics and predicting stochastic motion sequences, often overlooking flexibility and suffering from mode collapse.

Method: STCN uses a spatio-temporal continuous network for smoother motion sequences and introduces an anchor set to prevent mode collapse. It also employs GMM and sampling strategies to address intra-class differences.

Result: STCN achieves competitive performance in diversity and accuracy on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I datasets.

Conclusion: STCN effectively addresses challenges in stochastic human motion prediction, offering improved flexibility and reduced mode collapse.

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr²R), a method for lifelong person re-identification (LReID) that condenses sequential data into pixel-space replay samples, balancing privacy and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns in replay-based LReID methods while mitigating performance degradation from forgetting past knowledge representations.

Method: Condenses training data into pixel-space images for replay, aligns domains during replay, and adapts samples to current domain styles.

Result: Pr²R improves accuracy by 4-6% over state-of-the-art methods while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: Pr²R effectively balances privacy and performance in LReID, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

*Erhang Zhang,Junyi Ma,Yin-Dong Zheng,Yixuan Zhou,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoLoc is a zero-shot temporal interaction localization method for egocentric videos, improving accuracy and efficiency by combining 2D/3D observations and closed-loop feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for temporal action localization rely on annotated data, causing domain bias and inefficiency. Zero-shot approaches lack precision due to coarse-grained estimations.

Method: EgoLoc uses self-adaptive sampling for visual prompts, integrates 2D/3D observations, and employs closed-loop feedback for refinement.

Result: EgoLoc outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in temporal interaction localization on egocentric videos.

Conclusion: EgoLoc offers a robust solution for zero-shot TIL, with potential applications in behavior analysis and robotics.

Abstract: Locating human-object interaction (HOI) actions within video serves as the
foundation for multiple downstream tasks, such as human behavior analysis and
human-robot skill transfer. Current temporal action localization methods
typically rely on annotated action and object categories of interactions for
optimization, which leads to domain bias and low deployment efficiency.
Although some recent works have achieved zero-shot temporal action localization
(ZS-TAL) with large vision-language models (VLMs), their coarse-grained
estimations and open-loop pipelines hinder further performance improvements for
temporal interaction localization (TIL). To address these issues, we propose a
novel zero-shot TIL approach dubbed EgoLoc to locate the timings of grasp
actions for human-object interaction in egocentric videos. EgoLoc introduces a
self-adaptive sampling strategy to generate reasonable visual prompts for VLM
reasoning. By absorbing both 2D and 3D observations, it directly samples
high-quality initial guesses around the possible contact/separation timestamps
of HOI according to 3D hand velocities, leading to high inference accuracy and
efficiency. In addition, EgoLoc generates closed-loop feedback from visual and
dynamic cues to further refine the localization results. Comprehensive
experiments on the publicly available dataset and our newly proposed benchmark
demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves better temporal interaction localization for
egocentric videos compared to state-of-the-art baselines. We will release our
code and relevant data as open-source at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

*Hanxi Li,Jingqi Wu,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Mingliang Li,Deyin Liu,Jialie Shen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNARM introduces a self-referential learning framework for industrial anomaly detection, using inter- and intra-residual features and a Mamba module for SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve anomaly detection by dynamically refining detection using self-generated references within test images, reducing reliance on pre-trained features.

Method: Computes inter-residuals from test patches vs. training features, uses small-norm residuals as self-references for intra-residuals, and employs a Mamba module with dynamic navigation.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on MVTec AD, MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks, with improvements in Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Conclusion: SNARM's self-referential learning and dynamic navigation effectively enhance anomaly detection, outperforming conventional methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

### [93] [DMTrack: Spatio-Temporal Multimodal Tracking via Dual-Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01592)
*Weihong Li,Shaohua Dong,Haonan Lu,Yanhao Zhang,Heng Fan,Libo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMTrack introduces a dual-adapter architecture (STMA and PMCA) for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, achieving state-of-the-art results with minimal trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve spatio-temporal multimodal tracking by bridging modality gaps and enhancing cross-modality fusion.

Method: Uses STMA for self-prompting spatio-temporal features and PMCA for progressive cross-modality prompting with shallow and deep adapters.

Result: Achieves top performance on five benchmarks with only 0.93M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: DMTrack's dual-adapter design effectively enhances multimodal tracking efficiency and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

### [94] [CLIMD: A Curriculum Learning Framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01594)
*Kai Han,Chongwen Lyu,Lele Ma,Chengxuan Qian,Siqi Ma,Zheng Pang,Jun Chen,Zhe Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CLIMD, a curriculum learning framework for imbalanced multimodal diagnosis, addressing class imbalance and cross-modal interactions in medical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in multimodal medical data hinders accurate diagnosis, and existing methods like resampling or loss reweighting often lead to overfitting or underfitting.

Method: CLIMD uses a multimodal curriculum measurer (intra-modal confidence and inter-modal complementarity) and a class distribution-guided training scheduler.

Result: CLIMD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets and handles imbalanced data effectively.

Conclusion: CLIMD is a plug-and-play framework that enhances multimodal diagnosis accuracy and can be integrated into other models.

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

### [95] [Enhancing Zero-Shot Brain Tumor Subtype Classification via Fine-Grained Patch-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01602)
*Lubin Gan,Jing Zhang,Linhao Qu,Yijun Wang,Siying Wu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FG-PAN is a zero-shot framework for fine-grained brain tumor subtype classification, combining patch-level visual refinement and LLM-generated semantic prototypes to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in subtle morphological variations and limited annotated data for brain tumor subtypes, with existing vision-language models lacking fine-grained discrimination.

Method: FG-PAN includes a local feature refinement module for patch-level visual enhancement and a text description generation module using LLMs for semantic prototypes.

Result: FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot classification on datasets like EBRAINS and TCGA.

Conclusion: FG-PAN effectively addresses fine-grained classification challenges by aligning refined visual and semantic features, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

### [96] [Towards Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01603)
*Yiheng Li,Zichang Tan,Zhen Lei,Xu Zhou,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL) to improve AI-generated image detection by dynamically adjusting prompts based on input images, achieving high accuracy on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting AI-generated images struggle with generalization to unseen generators, as they rely on fixed parameters fine-tuned on limited data.

Method: IAPL introduces two adaptive modules: Conditional Information Learner (for forgery-specific and image-specific conditions) and Confidence-Driven Adaptive Prediction (for optimizing tokens and selecting confident views).

Result: IAPL achieves 95.61% and 96.7% mean accuracy on UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances adaptability to diverse forged images, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

*Lingyao Li,Runlong Yu,Qikai Hu,Bowei Li,Min Deng,Yang Zhou,Xiaowei Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces IMAGEO-Bench, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs for image geolocalization, revealing performance disparities, geospatial biases, and key factors like urban settings and landmarks influencing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' underexplored potential in image geolocalization for applications like crisis response and digital forensics.

Method: Developed IMAGEO-Bench with three diverse datasets, testing 10 LLMs on accuracy, distance error, bias, and reasoning.

Result: Closed-source models outperformed open-source ones, with biases favoring high-resource regions. Urban and landmark-rich images yielded better results.

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench highlights LLMs' spatial reasoning gaps and biases, guiding future geolocation-aware AI development.

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaDA-MedV is a new biomedical vision-language model using masked diffusion, outperforming ARMs and setting state-of-the-art results in biomedical VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore masked diffusion models in biomedical VLMs, where ARMs dominate, and improve performance in biomedical image understanding.

Method: LLaDA-MedV uses vision instruction tuning for biomedical image understanding, with detailed analysis of training and inference stages.

Result: Achieves 7.855% and 1.867% gains over LLaVA-Med and LLaDA-V, respectively, and sets new benchmarks in VQA tasks (84.93% on VQA-RAD, 92.31% on SLAKE, 95.15% on PathVQA).

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV demonstrates the potential of diffusion models in biomedical VLMs, offering longer, more informative responses and insights into training and inference optimization.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

TL;DR: A novel preprocessing framework enhances G-PCC by integrating a voxelization network and a differentiable surrogate model, achieving a 38.84% BD-rate reduction without decoder modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-PCC underperforms compared to deep learning-based PCC methods despite its lower computational power. The goal is to improve G-PCC's efficiency without losing interoperability or flexibility.

Method: Proposes a compression-oriented voxelization network and a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly optimized in training. The surrogate mimics G-PCC's rate-distortion behavior for gradient propagation.

Result: Achieves a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction over G-PCC, with no computational overhead for end users.

Conclusion: The framework bridges classical codecs with deep learning, enhancing legacy standards while preserving backward compatibility for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module for RGB-D glass surface segmentation, introduces the MJU-Glass dataset, and demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve glass surface segmentation by effectively fusing RGB and depth data to handle transparency, reflections, and occlusions.

Method: A plug-and-play WFF module dynamically combines RGB and depth features, integrated with deep neural networks. The MJU-Glass dataset is introduced for benchmarking.

Result: Significant improvements in segmentation accuracy (7.49% bIoU boost with PSPNet) and robustness.

Conclusion: The WFF module and MJU-Glass dataset advance glass segmentation in robotics, reducing collision risks with glass objects.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

### [101] [Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641)
*Yujian Liu,Yuechuan Lin,Dongxu Shen,Haoran Li,Yutong Wang,Xiaoli Liu,Shidang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework for efficient and accurate whole-slide image analysis, using only 9 high-resolution patches per image, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency and domain gap in whole-slide image analysis caused by traditional MIL and SSL approaches, which split histological structures and increase computational costs.

Method: CDSR uses a two-stage selective sampling strategy to identify informative regions and a Local-to-Global Network to reconstruct high-resolution representations.

Result: CDSR improves accuracy by 6.3% and AUC by 5.5% on classification tasks, using only 4.5% of patches compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CDSR offers a robust, efficient solution for WSI analysis, balancing morphological fidelity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using text or images lack precision and user-friendliness for hair strand generation.

Method: Proposes a learnable strand upsampling strategy and multi-scale adaptive conditioning with a transformer and diffusion heads.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in realism and precision on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The method offers finer control and user-friendliness, with qualitative results confirming effectiveness.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAG, a diffusion-based framework for 3D affordance grounding, leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to improve generalization and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D affordance grounding lack generalization due to limited affordance knowledge in demonstration images. The authors aim to address this by utilizing the rich affordance knowledge in text-to-image diffusion models.

Method: The proposed DAG framework uses frozen internal representations of text-to-image diffusion models, an affordance block, and a multi-source affordance decoder for 3D dense affordance prediction.

Result: Experiments show DAG outperforms established methods and demonstrates open-world generalization.

Conclusion: The DAG framework effectively unlocks affordance knowledge in diffusion models, achieving superior 3D affordance grounding performance and generalization.

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method to reduce hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by leveraging a 2D semantic map of hidden states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs often generate grammatically correct but factually inconsistent content (hallucinations). Existing methods focus on localized regions, missing widely distributed factual information.

Method: Proposes MAP, using Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention and Global-Local Logit Fusion to refine token representations and predictions by aggregating inter- and intra-layer information.

Result: MAP improves factual consistency and performance across benchmarks like POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench.

Conclusion: The map-level decoding strategy effectively mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs, demonstrating its potential for improving truthfulness.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

Motivation: Existing amodal segmentation methods rely on costly strong prompts or lack interpretability, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: VELA uses a velocity-driven level-set approach, evolving an initial contour from point prompts via a differentiable network predicting shape-specific motion fields.

Result: VELA outperforms strongly prompted methods on benchmarks (COCOA-cls, D2SA, KINS) with only a single-point prompt.

Conclusion: VELA offers interpretable, geometrically grounded amodal segmentation under weak guidance, with potential for broader real-world use.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

*Zhixuan Li,Yujia Liu,Chen Hui,Jeonghaeng Lee,Sanghoon Lee,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeMoE introduces a shape-specific sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation, improving performance by dynamically routing objects to specialized experts based on shape characteristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle with diverse amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity, necessitating a more tailored solution.

Method: ShapeMoE learns a latent shape distribution space and uses a Shape-Aware Sparse Router to dynamically assign objects to specialized experts.

Result: ShapeMoE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA, especially in occluded region segmentation.

Conclusion: ShapeMoE provides interpretable, efficient, and high-capacity amodal segmentation by leveraging shape-specific experts.

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

*Zhixiang Wei,Xiaoxiao Ma,Ruishen Yan,Tao Tu,Huaian Chen,Jinjin Zheng,Yi Jin,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rein++ is an efficient VFM-based segmentation framework addressing data scale disparity and domain shifts in semantic segmentation, combining domain generalization (Rein-G) and adaptation (Rein-A) for superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges in applying Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to semantic segmentation due to small dataset sizes and domain distribution shifts.

Method: Rein++ includes Rein-G (instance-aware tokens for feature refinement) and Rein-A (unsupervised domain adaptation at instance and logit levels, plus a semantic transfer module).

Result: Rein++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating robust generalization and adaptation with efficient training.

Conclusion: Rein++ is an efficient, generalizable, and adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

TL;DR: PatchMap is a benchmark for adversarial patch attacks, revealing vulnerable spots in vision models. A segmentation-guided method improves attack success rates by 8-13% over random placements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial patch attacks undermine vision model reliability, necessitating a systematic study of patch placement impact.

Method: PatchMap evaluates 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet to identify vulnerable regions. A segmentation-guided heuristic uses off-the-shelf masks to optimize patch placement without gradient queries.

Result: PatchMap identifies hot-spots where small patches cause misclassifications. The proposed method boosts attack success rates by 8-13% across architectures, including adversarially trained models.

Conclusion: PatchMap provides a valuable benchmark for location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks, with public release of data and code to accelerate research.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

*Zhaochen Wang,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt-in-Image embeds text instructions into images to reduce VLMs' hallucination by aligning multimodal info through a single visual channel. It improves Qwen2.5-VL but harms LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP due to attention bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address hallucination in VLMs caused by misaligned multimodal information processing.

Method: Embed textual instructions directly into images, forcing models to process all content visually.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL's accuracy improves (POPE +4.1%), while LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP's performance drops sharply.

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image enhances cross-modal alignment for some VLMs but reveals encoder-specific limitations.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

*Yufeng Chi,Huimin Ma,Kafeng Wang,Jianmin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DisCo3D improves 3D editing by distilling 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor, achieving stable multi-view consistency and superior editing quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending diffusion models to 3D editing is challenging due to multi-view inconsistency, slow convergence, and blurry artifacts in classical methods.

Method: DisCo3D fine-tunes a 3D generator with multi-view inputs, trains a 2D editor via consistency distillation, and optimizes edited outputs into 3D using Gaussian Splatting.

Result: DisCo3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality and maintains multi-view consistency.

Conclusion: DisCo3D effectively addresses 3D editing challenges by leveraging consistency distillation and Gaussian Splatting.

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

### [111] [Register Anything: Estimating "Corresponding Prompts" for Segment Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01697)
*Shiqi Huang,Tingfa Xu,Wen Yan,Dean Barratt,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PromptReg, a training-free image registration method that simplifies region-based correspondence by directly searching for corresponding prompts using pre-trained segmentation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional region-based correspondence requires two steps: segmenting ROIs and matching them. The paper aims to simplify this into one step by leveraging pre-trained models for direct prompt-based correspondence.

Method: The method involves identifying corresponding prompts between images, using an "inverse prompt" solution to invert prompts, and marginalizing them across dimensions for registration.

Result: PromptReg outperforms intensity-based and learning-based methods on various datasets, achieving competitive performance with weakly-supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed PromptReg method simplifies and improves image registration by leveraging pre-trained models for prompt-based correspondence, demonstrating superior performance across multiple applications.

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

*Zuhao Yang,Jiahui Zhang,Yingchen Yu,Shijian Lu,Song Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTG is a framework for generating smooth, high-quality transition videos between given frames using text prompts, addressing challenges like object identity preservation and motion smoothness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for video transition generation are limited in handling smoothness and semantic coherence, especially with abrupt content changes.

Method: VTG uses interpolation-based initialization, dual-directional motion fine-tuning, and representation alignment regularization to improve transition quality.

Result: VTG outperforms existing methods on TransitBench, a new benchmark for transition tasks like concept blending and scene transition.

Conclusion: VTG is a versatile and effective solution for high-fidelity transition video generation, setting a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

TL;DR: TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Video-LLM, dynamically routes task-specific tokens to specialized experts for improved Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-LLMs process all task tokens uniformly, failing to address the distinct needs of temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation in VTG tasks.

Method: Introduces TimeExpert, which uses dynamic routing to send task-specific tokens (e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, enhancing computational efficiency and precision.

Result: TimeExpert achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTG tasks like Dense Video Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Conclusion: TimeExpert effectively addresses the limitations of static processing in Video-LLMs, improving event modeling and performance in diverse VTG applications.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LT-Gaussian is a method for updating 3D-GS-based maps in autonomous driving, using multimodal splatting, change detection, and targeted updates to efficiently handle environmental changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Updating 3D-Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) maps is challenging due to high computational costs. LT-Gaussian addresses this by enabling efficient map updates.

Method: LT-Gaussian uses Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection, and Gaussian-Map Update Modules to compare old maps with new LiDAR data and update them.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show LT-Gaussian efficiently updates maps and produces higher-quality reconstructions than rebuilding from scratch.

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian effectively updates 3D-GS maps for autonomous driving, leveraging old and new data for better results.

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

TL;DR: GAID improves text-to-video retrieval by integrating audio-visual features adaptively and enhancing text embeddings with structured perturbations, achieving state-of-the-art results efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on visual cues and neglect audio semantics or use coarse fusion, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations.

Method: GAID uses Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) for fine-grained audio-visual alignment and Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) to enhance text embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX with efficiency gains.

Conclusion: GAID's adaptive fusion and perturbation modules yield stable, expressive representations, advancing multimodal retrieval.

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Motivation: Existing datasets lack fine-grained annotations, making hate speech detection in videos challenging.

Method: A three-stage annotation process was used to create HateClipSeg, with high inter-annotator agreement. Three benchmark tasks were proposed.

Result: Results show significant gaps in current models, highlighting the need for advanced multimodal and temporally aware approaches.

Conclusion: HateClipSeg provides a valuable resource for improving hate speech detection in videos, with publicly available data.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot-assisted surgeries require real-time scene understanding, but static datasets limit segmentation models in dynamic surgical environments. CISS helps adapt to new classes without forgetting prior knowledge.

Method: TOPICS+ incorporates Dice loss for class imbalance, hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and tailored taxonomies. It also introduces six CISS benchmarks and a refined label set for evaluation.

Result: The proposed method enhances segmentation in surgical scenes, with benchmarks and labels provided for evaluation.

Conclusion: TOPICS+ improves surgical scene segmentation, with publicly available code and models for further research.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces Granular Concept Circuit (GCC), a method to discover circuits in deep vision models that encode specific visual concepts, offering fine-grained interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding where and how visual concepts are encoded in distributed deep vision models is challenging but crucial for interpretability.

Method: GCC iteratively assesses inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on functional dependencies and semantic alignment, to construct circuits representing specific concepts.

Result: GCC effectively identifies fine-grained circuits tied to visual concepts across various deep image classification models.

Conclusion: GCC provides a profound, concept-wise interpretation of deep vision models, advancing interpretability at a fine-grained level.

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

TL;DR: AMOT improves multi-object tracking in UAV videos by jointly using appearance and motion cues via an AMC matrix and MTC module, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in UAV videos, like viewpoint changes and complex motion, cause unstable tracking. Existing methods separate motion and appearance cues, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes AMOT with an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix for reliable identity association and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module to reduce broken trajectories.

Result: AMOT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UAV benchmarks (VisDrone2019, UAVDT, VT-MOT-UAV) and generalizes well without training.

Conclusion: AMOT effectively addresses UAV tracking challenges by integrating appearance and motion cues, offering robust and training-free performance.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art

### [120] [CSLRConformer: A Data-Centric Conformer Approach for Continuous Arabic Sign Language Recognition on the Isharah Datase](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01791)
*Fatimah Mohamed Emad Elden*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-centric approach for Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR), introducing feature engineering, preprocessing, and the CSLRConformer model to address signer-independent recognition, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization in CSLR systems by tackling challenges like inter-sign transitions and co-articulation effects, focusing on signer-independent recognition.

Method: A data-centric approach with feature selection via EDA, preprocessing (DBSCAN filtering, spatial normalization), and the novel CSLRConformer architecture (hybrid CNN-Transformer).

Result: Achieved WER of 5.60% (development) and 12.01% (test), securing 3rd place in the competition.

Conclusion: Validates cross-domain adaptation of the Conformer model for CSLR, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

*Yuxiang Zhang,Wei Li,Mengmeng Zhang,Jiawei Han,Ran Tao,Shunlin Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralX is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to handle diverse spectral imagery without extensive pretraining, improving domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of foundation models for multispectral/hyperspectral data and leverage spectral imagery advantages in earth observation.

Method: A two-stage training approach: (1) masked-reconstruction with Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) and Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA), (2) semantic segmentation with Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter).

Result: SpectralX effectively adapts RSFMs to new spectral modalities, enhancing domain generalization for interpreting imagery from new regions/seasons.

Conclusion: SpectralX offers a scalable solution for adapting RSFMs to diverse spectral inputs, reducing the need for extensive pretraining.

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AG$^2$aussian introduces an anchor-graph structure to organize semantic features in 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving segmentation and Gaussian selection for scene understanding and editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian representations lead to noisy segmentation and messy Gaussian selection, necessitating a more structured approach.

Method: The framework uses an anchor-graph structure to organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives, promoting compact and instance-aware distributions.

Result: The approach achieves clean and accurate instance-level Gaussian selection, validated across four applications.

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian effectively addresses limitations of existing methods and benefits diverse applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

### [123] [Simulated Ensemble Attack: Transferring Jailbreaks Across Fine-tuned Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01741)
*Ruofan Wang,Xin Wang,Yang Yao,Xuan Tong,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEA, a grey-box jailbreak method, exploits vulnerabilities in fine-tuned VLMs by simulating parameter shifts and guiding adversarial outputs, achieving high transfer attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight the underexplored risk of transferable vulnerabilities in fine-tuned VLMs inherited from base models.

Method: SEA combines Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG) to generate transferable adversarial attacks.

Result: SEA achieves 86.5% transfer attack success and 49.5% toxicity rates across fine-tuned VLMs, even safety-enhanced ones.

Conclusion: Urgent need for holistic defenses to protect fine-tuned VLMs from inherited vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

*Qiaohui Chu,Haoyu Zhang,Meng Liu,Yisen Feng,Haoxiang Shi,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT is a two-stage framework for egocentric action anticipation, leveraging hand-object interactions and verb-noun dependencies with cognitive reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing methods for long-term action anticipation, such as underutilized visual cues, neglected semantic dependencies, and lack of cognitive reasoning.

Method: A two-stage approach: 1) extracting features from hand-object interactions and verb-noun co-occurrence, 2) reinforcement learning for cognitive reasoning (perception, inference, anticipation).

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks.

Conclusion: INSIGHT effectively overcomes prior limitations, demonstrating strong generalization and forecasting ability.

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

*Runkai Zheng,Vishnu Asutosh Dasu,Yinong Oliver Wang,Haohan Wang,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework improves differentially private dataset distillation by decoupling sampling from optimization and enhancing signal quality, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns in machine learning by efficiently generating synthetic datasets without compromising performance or privacy.

Method: Decouples sampling from optimization and mitigates DP noise impact by matching in an informative subspace.

Result: Achieves 10.0% improvement with 50 images per class and 8.3% increase with reduced distilled set size on CIFAR-10.

Conclusion: The framework advances privacy-preserving dataset distillation, offering better efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

*Kumail Abbas,Zeeshan Afzal,Aqeel Raza,Taha Mansouri,Andrew W. Dowsey,Chaidate Inchaisri,Ali Alameer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-camera, real-time tracking system using advanced computer vision techniques was developed to monitor dairy cow activity accurately, outperforming existing methods with high MOTA and IDF1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual monitoring of dairy cow activity is laborious and inconsistent, necessitating an automated, accurate system for health and welfare assessment.

Method: The system integrates six camera feeds using homographic transformations, employs YOLO11-m for detection, SAMURAI for segmentation, and a motion-aware Kalman filter for tracking.

Result: Achieved high accuracy (MOTA 98.7%-99.3%, IDF1 >99%) with minimal identity switches, outperforming Deep SORT Realtime.

Conclusion: The system enables real-time, precise cow tracking in complex environments, aiding early disease prediction and farm productivity.

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

*Shuo Feng,Zihan Wang,Yuchen Li,Rui Kong,Hengyi Cai,Shuaiqiang Wang,Gim Hee Lee,Piji Li,Shuqiang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a method for guiding embodied agents using visual prompts on 2D top-view maps instead of language, reducing ambiguity and improving usability for non-experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language instructions for navigation are often ambiguous and verbose, hindering effectiveness in complex environments.

Method: VPN uses visual prompts (trajectory markings on 2D maps) and introduces VPNet, a baseline network with view-level and trajectory-level data augmentation.

Result: Experiments evaluate visual prompt forms, map formats, and augmentation strategies, showing improved navigation performance.

Conclusion: VPN offers intuitive, spatially grounded guidance, reducing ambiguity and enhancing usability, with datasets and code provided for further research.

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffSemanticFusion is a fusion framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning, combining raster and graph-based representations for improved HD map generation and autonomous driving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate scene understanding in autonomous driving requires balancing geometric precision (graph-based) and vision model compatibility (raster-based).

Method: The framework uses a semantic raster-fused BEV space enhanced by a map diffusion module to improve stability and expressiveness of online HD maps.

Result: Achieves 5.1% improvement in trajectory prediction on nuScenes and 15% gain in NAVSIM's NavHard scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion effectively combines raster and graph strengths, enhancing performance in trajectory prediction and end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

*Xiaotong Zhang,Alexander Broersen,Gonnie CM van Erp,Silvia L. Pintea,Jouke Dijkstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A point-based method for Couinaud liver segmentation without explicit vessel structure, using graph reasoning to learn anatomical affinities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preoperative liver surgery planning requires accurate segmentation, but point-based methods traditionally need time-consuming prior vessel knowledge.

Method: Proposes a point-based approach with a graph reasoning module to implicitly learn liver vessel structure from point neighborhoods.

Result: Competes with leading point-based methods on MSD and LiTS datasets in Dice and surface distance metrics.

Conclusion: The method effectively segments liver Couinaud regions without explicit vessel structure, improving efficiency.

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GrPn.

TL;DR: EST-LoRA is a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method that balances subject and style in generation tasks by considering energy, style discrepancy, and time steps, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA fusion methods struggle to balance subject and style and often require additional training, while K-LoRA's hyperparameters limit adaptability.

Method: EST-LoRA adaptively selects between subject and style LoRA in each attention layer, using energy, style discrepancy, and time steps for balanced contributions.

Result: EST-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quality and speed, achieving faster generation without additional training.

Conclusion: EST-LoRA provides an effective, training-free solution for balanced subject-style generation, with superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and temporally coherent 3D hand motion reconstruction from videos, especially during hand-object interactions, remains challenging.

Method: A diffusion-based and physics-augmented motion refinement model trained on motion capture data, integrating intuitive physics knowledge like motion states and constraints.

Result: Significantly improves frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving SOTA performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances 3D hand motion recovery by combining diffusion models with physics insights, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately estimate camera pose relative to a planar target from reference points and bearing measurements, addressing noise sensitivity.

Method: Hierarchical approach: first estimates the target plane's normal, then camera position, distance, and full orientation, with averaging for noise robustness.

Result: Validated through experiments, showing improved accuracy and robustness to measurement noise.

Conclusion: The method effectively estimates camera pose from planar targets, with enhanced robustness against noise.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

*Weiqi Yan,Chenlu Lin,Youbiao Wang,Zhipeng Cai,Xiuhong Lin,Yangyang Shi,Weiquan Liu,Yu Zang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniEvent is a unified event representation learning framework for event cameras, eliminating task-specific designs and achieving SOTA performance across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event networks rely on task-specific designs due to unstructured data and spatial-temporal inhomogeneity, limiting reusability.

Method: Proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm: local feature aggregation in spatial and temporal domains independently, using space-filling curves for efficiency, and fusing features via attention.

Result: Outperforms task-specific SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 tasks and 10 datasets.

Conclusion: OmniEvent provides a unified, efficient framework for event data, enabling standard vision models to process it without modification.

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent

### [135] [Beyond Vulnerabilities: A Survey of Adversarial Attacks as Both Threats and Defenses in Computer Vision Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01845)
*Zhongliang Guo,Yifei Qian,Yanli Li,Weiye Li,Chun Tong Lei,Shuai Zhao,Lei Fang,Ognjen Arandjelović,Chun Pong Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on adversarial attacks in computer vision, covering methodologies, evolution, and dual roles as threats and defensive tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand adversarial techniques' impact on neural network robustness and security, and their potential for defensive applications.

Method: Systematic analysis of adversarial attacks in pixel-space, physically realizable, and latent-space domains, tracing technical evolution from gradient-based to advanced optimization techniques.

Result: Identifies critical research gaps, provides a taxonomy, and outlines future directions for robust computer vision systems.

Conclusion: Adversarial techniques are both threats and tools, requiring further research to enhance system robustness and security.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

### [136] [Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852)
*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model to reduce video redundancy by leveraging spatio-temporal contexts more efficiently, addressing issues of model complexity and spatial dependency ordering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conditional entropy models for video redundancy reduction introduce high computational costs and lack explicit modeling of spatial dependency order, limiting context availability during decoding.

Method: The CGT model uses a temporal context resampler with transformer encoders and a teacher-student network for dependency-weighted spatial context. The teacher guides the student to select top-k tokens based on spatial dependency.

Result: The CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by ~65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The CGT model effectively balances computational efficiency and performance by improving spatio-temporal context utilization.

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

### [137] [Distinguishing Target and Non-Target Fixations with EEG and Eye Tracking in Realistic Visual Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01853)
*Mansi Sharma,Camilo Andrés Martínez Martínez,Benedikt Emanuel Wirth,Antonio Krüger,Philipp Müller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates classifying target vs. non-target fixations during free visual search in realistic scenes using gaze and EEG data, outperforming prior methods with 83.6% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior studies used abstract stimuli and ignored scene context, limiting generalizability to real-world scenarios. This work addresses this gap.

Method: A 36-participant study with 140 realistic scenes (e.g., icons on desktops, tools in workshops) using gaze and EEG features.

Result: The approach achieved 83.6% accuracy, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art (56.9%).

Conclusion: The method advances realistic visual search classification, demonstrating strong generalizability across scene types.

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

*Siran Peng,Haoyuan Zhang,Li Gao,Tianshuo Zhang,Bao Li,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffusionFF improves face forgery detection by using diffusion models to localize artifacts and enhance accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for robust detection and precise localization of deepfake artifacts to improve explainability and trust.

Method: Uses a denoising diffusion model to generate DSSIM maps, fused with semantic features from a pretrained detector.

Result: Achieves superior detection performance and fine-grained artifact localization in benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiffusionFF is effective for both detection and localization, enhancing trust in forgery detection.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

### [139] [Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination via Attention Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02419)
*Haohan Zheng,Zhenguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs), identifying a new issue called modality bias where LVLMs ignore both visual and textual cues. It proposes a training-free method to balance attention weights and uses contrastive decoding to reduce overreliance on LLM knowledge, showing effectiveness across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from object hallucination, often attributed to linguistic prior. The study reveals a deeper issue—modality bias—where LVLMs ignore both visual and textual information, leading to fragmented understanding.

Method: The paper introduces a training-free method to adjust attention weights of textual and visual tokens, balancing cross-modal compatibility. It also employs contrastive decoding to reduce reliance on LLM knowledge.

Result: Experiments confirm widespread modality bias in LVLMs. The proposed method effectively mitigates hallucination across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks.

Conclusion: The study highlights modality bias as a key issue in LVLMs and demonstrates the efficacy of a simple, training-free solution to improve cross-modal alignment and reduce hallucination.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes StreamAgent for proactive, goal-driven video understanding in real-time streaming, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations of current methods in real-time video processing, which lack proactive decision-making and future anticipation.

Method: Integrates question semantics and historical observations to anticipate key events, using a streaming KV-cache memory for efficient inference.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and real-time efficiency on streaming and long video tasks.

Conclusion: StreamAgent offers practical value for real-world streaming scenarios by enabling proactive responses and efficient memory usage.

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

*Michael W. Rutherford,Tracy Nolan,Linmin Pei,Ulrike Wagner,Qinyan Pan,Phillip Farmer,Kirk Smith,Benjamin Kopchick,Laura Opsahl-Ong,Granger Sutton,David Clunie,Keyvan Farahani,Fred Prior*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for benchmarking medical image de-identification workflows using a synthetic dataset to ensure privacy and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of patient privacy in medical imaging data sharing by providing an objective evaluation method for de-identification tools.

Method: Developed the MIDI dataset with synthetic PHI/PII, using TCIA data, and created evaluation tools for automated benchmarking.

Result: The MIDI dataset includes 538 subjects and 53,581 DICOM images, with tools for objective assessment of de-identification workflows.

Conclusion: The framework promotes safer, standards-driven medical image sharing by ensuring effective de-identification.

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

*Akshay Paruchuri,Sinan Hersek,Lavisha Aggarwal,Qiao Yang,Xin Liu,Achin Kulshrestha,Andrea Colaco,Henry Fuchs,Ishan Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoTrigger uses audio cues to selectively activate cameras in smart glasses, reducing energy use by 54% while maintaining performance for memory enhancement tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smart glasses need energy-efficient solutions for continuous sensing to support all-day use and human memory enhancement.

Method: EgoTrigger leverages a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and custom classification to trigger cameras based on hand-object interaction sounds.

Result: EgoTrigger reduces frame usage by 54%, saving energy without compromising performance on memory tasks.

Conclusion: EgoTrigger offers an energy-efficient, context-aware approach for smart glasses, enabling all-day use for memory enhancement applications.

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

*Conor Wallace,Isaac Corley,Jonathan Lwowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InspectVLM, a unified vision-language model, shows promise for industrial inspection but falls short in robustness and precision compared to traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the viability of unified vision-language models (VLMs) for simplifying industrial inspection tasks, addressing complexity and inefficiency of task-specific models.

Method: InspectVLM, based on Florence-2 and trained on InspectMM dataset, is tested on classification, detection, and keypoint tasks.

Result: Competitive in classification and keypoint tasks but underperforms in core inspection metrics, showing brittleness and degenerate outputs for fine-grained tasks.

Conclusion: Current VLMs lack visual grounding and robustness for precision-critical industrial inspections despite their conceptual appeal.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore U-Net's potential in query-based segmentation and address challenges like overlapping cells and size variability in biomedical imaging.

Method: IAUNet combines a full U-Net with a lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder and a Transformer decoder for multi-scale feature refinement.

Result: Outperforms existing models on public and new datasets, including the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset.

Conclusion: IAUNet sets a strong baseline for cell instance segmentation, offering efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

*Kyle Stein,Andrew A. Mahyari,Guillermo Francia III,Eman El-Sheikh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBOM is a proactive framework using structured disentanglement to detect and neutralize backdoor threats in datasets, leveraging VLMs for zero-shot generalization to unseen trigger-object pairings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the vulnerability of DNNs and GenAI to backdoor attacks, especially unseen configurations, by detecting poisoned data before training.

Method: Uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to disentangle triggers and objects via visual prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, aided by separation and diversity losses.

Result: Effectively detects poisoned images on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB, improving DNN training pipeline security.

Conclusion: DBOM offers robust detection of backdoor threats, including unseen configurations, enhancing AI model security.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

Result: Superior accuracy and robustness in multi-altitude pose estimation compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: The system is effective for real-world applications like aerial navigation and search and rescue.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-altitude camera pose estimation system, addressing
the challenges of robust and accurate localization across varied altitudes when
only considering sparse image input. The system effectively handles diverse
environmental conditions and viewpoint variations by integrating the cross-view
transformer, deep features, and structure-from-motion into a unified framework.
To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly
collected datasets specifically tailored for multi-altitude camera pose
estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in
both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks
compared to existing solutions, making it well suited for real-world robotic
applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated
inspection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) to pretrain YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled images, reducing dependency on labeled data. Results show improved performance in low-label scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on large-scale labeled datasets for training one-stage object detectors like YOLO by leveraging unlabeled data through SSL.

Method: Adapts YOLO backbones as encoders, uses global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes contrastive loss with SimCLR on COCO unlabeled data. Fine-tunes on a cyclist detection task with limited labels.

Result: SSL pretraining improves mAP, convergence speed, and precision-recall, e.g., YOLOv8 achieves 0.7663 mAP@50:95, outperforming supervised training without pretraining annotations.

Conclusion: Contrastive SSL is effective for one-stage detectors, demonstrating the potential of unlabeled data for label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for point cloud downsampling in AVs, preserving object-related data while reducing storage and processing costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of high data volume in AV point clouds, which strains storage, bandwidth, and processing.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) Object Presence Detection using unsupervised and supervised classifiers, (2) Sampling Budget Allocation for selecting object-relevant points.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in efficiency and effectiveness on KITTI and nuScenes datasets.

Conclusion: A scalable, model-agnostic solution for AV point cloud downsampling, compatible with diverse downstream models.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models struggle to identify subtle visual cues differentiating melanoma from benign lesions, necessitating a more robust approach.

Result: The model achieves higher accuracy and better resilience against false positives in melanoma detection.

Conclusion: The work advances automated skin cancer recognition and validates dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

*Yijun Wei,Jianyu Wang,Leping Xiao,Zuoqiang Shi,Xing Fu,Lingyun Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel NLOS imaging method uses 2D functions and a Quasi-Fresnel transform to reduce computational and memory costs, enabling real-time, high-resolution imaging on lightweight devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NLOS imaging methods use 3D modeling, which is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting practical applications and real-time performance on lightweight devices.

Method: The proposed approach represents hidden scenes with 2D functions and employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform for direct inversion, reducing complexity and memory usage.

Result: The method reduces runtime and memory demands by orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging quality, enabling NLOS imaging on mobile and embedded systems.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and expands its applicability to lightweight platforms.

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

### [152] [Devil is in the Detail: Towards Injecting Fine Details of Image Prompt in Image Generation via Conflict-free Guidance and Stratified Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02004)
*Kyungmin Jo,Jooyeol Yun,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in text-to-image diffusion models by improving image prompts through conflict-free guidance and a new self-attention method, Stratified Attention, to better reflect intricate details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle to capture fine details from image prompts, leading to conflicting signals in classifier-free guidance and a trade-off between realism and alignment.

Method: Proposes conflict-free guidance to avoid conflicting signals and Stratified Attention to balance realism and alignment by jointly using keys and values from both images.

Result: Outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting image prompts across three tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method resolves key issues in image prompting, enhancing both alignment with prompts and realism in generated images.

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

*Tianyuan Zhang,Ting Jin,Lu Wang,Jiangfan Liu,Siyuan Liang,Mingchuan Zhang,Aishan Liu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bench2ADVLM introduces a closed-loop evaluation framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in autonomous driving, addressing gaps in current open-loop testing by enabling real-time, interactive assessment across simulation and physical platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation protocols for VLM-based autonomous driving systems lack closed-loop testing, which is crucial for assessing interactive behavior and real-world safety.

Method: The framework uses a dual-system adaptation architecture to translate high-level driving commands into mid-level actions for simulation and low-level signals for physical vehicles, alongside a self-reflective scenario generation module.

Result: Experiments show existing ADVLMs perform poorly under closed-loop conditions, highlighting the framework's diagnostic strength.

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM provides a comprehensive hierarchical evaluation pipeline, bridging the gap between simulation and reality for safer autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

### [154] [Protego: User-Centric Pose-Invariant Privacy Protection Against Face Recognition-Induced Digital Footprint Exposure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02034)
*Ziling Wang,Shuya Yang,Jialin Lu,Ka-Ho Chow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protego is a privacy protection method that deforms facial images to prevent retrieval-based intrusions, outperforming existing methods by 2x and maintaining visual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns from facial recognition technologies that expose personal data without consent.

Method: Encapsulates 3D facial signatures into pose-invariant 2D representations, dynamically deformed into natural-looking 3D masks.

Result: Reduces retrieval accuracy significantly across black-box FR models and performs 2x better than existing methods.

Conclusion: Protego effectively combats misuse of facial recognition for surveillance and identity tracing.

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

*Hui Xie,Haiqin Hu,Lijuan Ding,Qing Li,Yue Sun,Tao Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADDiff-Dose, a conditional diffusion model, improves radiotherapy dose prediction with better accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for radiotherapy dose prediction lack generalization, accuracy, and clinical usability, necessitating a more efficient and accurate solution.

Method: The model uses LightweightVAE3D for CT data compression, integrates multimodal inputs, and employs a progressive noise addition-denoising framework with multi-head attention and a composite loss function.

Result: ADDiff-Dose outperforms baselines with lower MAE (0.101-0.154), higher DICE (0.927), and reduced spinal cord dose error (<0.1 Gy), cutting planning time to 22 seconds per case.

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose is the first conditional diffusion model for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable, efficient solution to automate treatment planning and enhance clinical workflow.

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

*Sparsh Garg,Abhishek Aich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new validation set for traffic signs, MVV, is introduced to improve fine-grained annotations in autonomous driving. DINOv2 outperforms VLMs in recognition tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack fine-grained annotations for traffic signs, crucial for autonomous driving safety.

Method: Created MVV dataset with pixel-level instance masks, manually annotated. Benchmarked VLMs against DINOv2.

Result: DINOv2 consistently outperforms VLMs in traffic sign recognition and other categories.

Conclusion: MVV and DINOv2 provide a robust baseline for fine-grained perception in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

*Junhao Cai,Taegun An,Chengjun Jin,Sung Il Choi,JuHyun Park,Changhee Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) for efficient distributed multi-stage image compression, outperforming existing methods in rate-distortion performance and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in distributed multi-stage image compression, such as underutilized compute resources, repeated costly operations, and lack of post-encoding flexibility.

Method: Developed HCF with direct latent-space transformations, policy-driven quantization control, and edge quantization principle for optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 0.6dB PSNR gains, outperforms successive-compression by 5.56% BD-Rate, and saves up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU memory, and 90.0% execution time.

Conclusion: HCF offers superior performance and efficiency, enabling retraining-free cross-quality adaptation and significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StarPose is an autoregressive diffusion framework for monocular 3D human pose estimation, improving accuracy and temporal consistency by integrating historical pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods, which lack temporal consistency and spatial-temporal correlations in 3D pose sequences.

Method: Proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework with a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM) and Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and temporal consistency on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: StarPose effectively enhances 3D human pose estimation by leveraging historical data and physical guidance, setting a new benchmark for performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a structured radiology report generation (S-RRG) approach using an LLM-based model, a new dataset (MIMIC-STRUC), and a specialized evaluation metric (S-Score) to improve clinical relevance and report quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional free-text radiology reports are redundant and inconsistent, while existing structured approaches lack expressiveness and omit critical details. The paper aims to address these limitations.

Method: The approach involves constructing a structured dataset (MIMIC-STRUC), training an LLM-based model for report generation, and introducing a new evaluation metric (S-Score) to assess clinical relevance.

Result: The proposed method generates standardized, high-quality reports and demonstrates stronger alignment with human assessments through the S-Score.

Conclusion: Structured reports and tailored evaluation metrics enhance clinical relevance and report quality in radiology, offering a more meaningful measure for decision-making.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs lack dynamic spatiotemporal reasoning abilities (e.g., tracking object movements), which are crucial for real-world applications.

Method: Developed VLM4D, a benchmark with diverse videos and QA pairs focusing on motions and perspective shifts, and evaluated state-of-the-art VLMs.

Result: VLMs show significant performance gaps in integrating visual cues and temporal coherence compared to humans.

Conclusion: The study highlights VLMs' limitations in dynamic reasoning and proposes solutions like 4D feature fields, aiming to advance robust visual intelligence.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack real-time responsiveness and physical feasibility in dynamic human-machine interactions.

Method: Uses an auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner for joint action-reaction prediction and integrates reinforcement learning for motion tracking.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility.

Conclusion: Human-X advances human-robot collaboration, validated in real-world VR/AR and robotics applications.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,

large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

### [164] [DeflareMamba: Hierarchical Vision Mamba for Contextually Consistent Lens Flare Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02113)
*Yihang Huang,Yuanfei Huang,Junhui Lin,Hua Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeflareMamba introduces state space models for flare removal, addressing contextual inconsistency with a hierarchical framework and local-enhanced state space models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lens flare removal is challenging due to complex optical interactions; existing methods lack contextual consistency.

Method: Uses state space models for efficient sequence modeling, with a hierarchical framework for long-range pixel correlations and local-enhanced models for detail preservation.

Result: Effectively removes various flare artifacts while maintaining natural non-flare regions, improving downstream tasks like object recognition.

Conclusion: DeflareMamba is the first to apply state space models to flare removal, demonstrating superior performance and broader applicability.

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

*Mingjie Liu,Hanqing Liu,Chuang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NRE-Net improves object detection in adverse lighting by fusing RGB, event data, and predicted normal maps, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse lighting causes false detections in event cameras; RGB and event data alone are insufficient. Robust geometric cues are needed.

Method: Proposes NRE-Net, fusing RGB, event streams, and normal maps using ADFM and EAFM modules.

Result: Achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based methods, surpassing fusion-based approaches.

Conclusion: NRE-Net effectively addresses adverse lighting challenges, enhancing detection accuracy with multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework improves dynamic urban scene modeling by leveraging temporally consistent priors from a video diffusion model, addressing challenges like fast-moving objects and temporal discontinuities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dynamic urban scene modeling rely on pre-calibrated object tracks or struggle with fast-moving objects due to temporal discontinuities, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: The proposed framework uses a video diffusion model to distill temporally consistent priors, with innovations like joint timestamp optimization for pose alignment and uncertainty distillation for adaptive content integration.

Result: The method achieves a ~2 dB PSNR gain in novel view synthesis, particularly enhancing performance for fast-moving objects.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses limitations in dynamic scene modeling, offering improved accuracy and robustness for fast-moving objects.

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

### [167] [A Neural Quality Metric for BRDF Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02131)
*Behnaz Kavoosighafi,Rafal K. Mantiuk,Saghi Hajisharif,Ehsan Miandji,Jonas Unger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation is introduced, operating directly in BRDF space without rendering, outperforming traditional metrics in correlation with human judgments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional BRDF-space metrics fail to capture perceptual differences in rendered images, necessitating a perceptually informed alternative.

Method: A compact MLP is trained on measured and synthetic BRDF data, labeled using a perceptually validated image-space metric, to predict perceptual quality (JOD scores).

Result: The neural metric achieves higher correlation with human judgments than existing BRDF-space metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed metric provides a perceptually grounded alternative for BRDF evaluation, though its use as a loss function for fitting remains limited.

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

### [168] [Free-MoRef: Instantly Multiplexing Context Perception Capabilities of Video-MLLMs within Single Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02134)
*Kuo Wang,Quanlong Zheng,Junlin Xie,Yanhao Zhang,Jinguo Luo,Haonan Lu,Liang Lin,Fan Zhou,Guanbin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free-MoRef is a training-free approach for Video-MLLMs to handle long videos efficiently by splitting and fusing vision tokens, improving performance without compression or extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Video-MLLMs struggle with long videos due to context length limitations, leading to suboptimal performance. Free-MoRef addresses this without sacrificing granularity or efficiency.

Method: Free-MoRef splits vision tokens into multi-reference chunks, uses MoRef-attention for parallel clue gathering, and fuses references to enhance cross-reference interactions.

Result: Free-MoRef achieves 2× to 8× longer input frame perception without compression, outperforming trained long-video-MLLMs on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: Free-MoRef efficiently enhances Video-MLLM performance for long videos, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution without additional training.

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AID4AD, a dataset combining aerial imagery with nuScenes for AV perception tasks, showing improved accuracy in map construction and motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance automated vehicle perception by integrating spatially aligned aerial imagery, especially where high-definition maps are impractical.

Method: AID4AD aligns aerial imagery with nuScenes using SLAM-based maps, proposes an alignment workflow, and includes manual quality control for high-quality alignments.

Result: Aerial imagery improves map construction accuracy by 15-23% and trajectory prediction by 2%.

Conclusion: Aerial imagery is a scalable and adaptable environmental context source for AVs, with AID4AD released to support further research.

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

TL;DR: TrackletGait improves gait recognition in real-world scenarios with novel techniques like Random Tracklet Sampling, Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling, and Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gait recognition in uncontrolled environments is challenging due to non-periodic and occluded silhouette sequences, which conventional methods struggle with.

Method: Proposes TrackletGait with Random Tracklet Sampling, Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling, and Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss to enhance robustness and representation.

Result: Achieves 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on Gait3D and GREW datasets with only 10.3M parameters.

Conclusion: TrackletGait effectively addresses real-world gait recognition challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURORA improves Ref-AVS tasks by enhancing reasoning and segmentation through structured CoT prompting, feature distillation loss, and a two-stage training strategy, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack semantic understanding and compromise precision; AURORA aims to enhance reasoning and segmentation.

Method: Uses Chain-of-Thought prompting, segmentation feature distillation loss, and a two-stage training strategy (self-correction and GRPO).

Result: AURORA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes well.

Conclusion: AURORA effectively integrates reasoning and segmentation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttriCtrl is a plug-and-play framework for precise, continuous control of aesthetic attributes in text-to-image diffusion models, overcoming ambiguity in textual prompts and reliance on human preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes in text-to-image generation is challenging due to vague textual prompts and costly human preference data.

Method: AttriCtrl quantifies aesthetics using semantic similarity from vision-language models and employs a lightweight value encoder to map scalar intensities to embeddings in diffusion-based generation.

Result: AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over individual and multi-attribute composition, with seamless integration into existing frameworks.

Conclusion: AttriCtrl offers intuitive, customizable aesthetic manipulation with minimal training overhead, demonstrating strong practical utility.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a fast and efficient Chambolle-Pock (CP) framework for convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and dictionary learning (CDL), eliminating manual parameter tuning and improving convergence speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ADMM-based CSC methods require careful penalty parameter selection, which can lead to slow or no convergence. The CP framework offers a parameter-free alternative with faster convergence.

Method: The authors introduce a CP framework for CSC and CDL, incorporating an anisotropic total variation penalty for coefficient maps.

Result: The CP-based method matches ADMM performance on noise-free images and outperforms it in denoising Gaussian noise-polluted images.

Conclusion: The CP framework is a robust, efficient alternative to ADMM for CSC and CDL, with advantages in convergence speed and parameter-free operation.

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

TL;DR: DreamPainter addresses e-commerce background generation challenges by combining text prompts and reference images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in e-commerce include product-background consistency and reliance on text prompts alone for control.

Method: Introduces DreamEcom-400K dataset and DreamPainter framework, leveraging text and reference images for control.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, ensuring high product consistency and effective control.

Conclusion: DreamPainter successfully integrates text and visual signals for precise e-commerce image generation.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for 3D pose estimation rely on RGB-D inputs or separate models for detection and pose estimation, which are limiting or inefficient.

Method: The paper introduces a unified framework integrating detection and pose estimation using neural mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC.

Result: The model achieves a 22.9% improvement in RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275 and shows greater robustness than single-stage baselines.

Conclusion: The unified approach outperforms traditional methods, offering a more efficient and accurate solution for 3D pose estimation from RGB images.

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL3AN is a novel dataset and learning framework for restoring images under colored light, addressing limitations of existing methods by disentangling illumination and reflectance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods oversimplify illumination challenges, leading to artifacts. CL3AN aims to address these complexities.

Method: Uses a learning framework with chromaticity and luminance guidance inspired by the Retinex model.

Result: Achieves robust performance under non-homogeneous lighting and material variations with competitive computational cost.

Conclusion: CL3AN effectively restores images under complex lighting, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing model collapse and structural information deficiency in self-supervised 3D representation learning due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty.

Method: Integrates feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to convert point clouds into a unified Gaussian representation, with a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module for cross-modal feature capturing.

Result: Achieves superior performance with high efficiency (<0.1% parameters, 1% data) and improves fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200.

Conclusion: GaussianCross effectively addresses current challenges, demonstrating robustness, efficiency, and strong generalization in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal requirements (HIPAA) mandate de-identification of PII/PHI in DICOM files to protect patient privacy, including headers and pixel data.

Method: Implemented a HIPAA-compliant algorithm with customizable parameters to classify and de-identify DICOM tags.

Result: Successfully recognized and de-identified sensitive data like names, history, and institution details.

Conclusion: The flexible, customizable Python algorithm is promising for both research and daily use, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

### [179] [Weakly Supervised Multimodal Temporal Forgery Localization via Multitask Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02179)
*Wenbo Xu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes WMMT, a weakly supervised multitask learning method for multimodal fine-grained temporal forgery localization in Deepfake videos, achieving results comparable to fully supervised approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused trust issues and social instability, yet there's a lack of systematic research on weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal forgery localization (WS-MTFL).

Method: WMMT uses video-level annotations for multimodal detection and localization, employing a Mixture-of-Experts structure, feature enhancement with attention, and a deviation perceiving loss for temporal information.

Result: WMMT achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods in Deepfake detection and localization.

Conclusion: The multitask learning paradigm in WMMT effectively addresses WS-MTFL, demonstrating flexibility and precision in localization.

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

*Zeshuai Deng,Guohao Chen,Shuaicheng Niu,Hui Luo,Shuhai Zhang,Yifan Yang,Renjie Chen,Wei Luo,Mingkui Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework for quantized models to address performance degradation in dynamic environments, achieving efficient adaptation with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantized models suffer severe performance degradation in dynamic environments with domain shifts, and existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are impractical due to gradient backpropagation constraints.

Method: The authors introduce ZOA, requiring only two forward passes for adaptation, and a domain knowledge management scheme to store and reuse domain knowledge efficiently.

Result: ZOA improves quantized model robustness, achieving a 5.0% performance boost over state-of-the-art methods on the ImageNet-C dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed ZOA framework effectively enhances quantized model adaptability in dynamic environments with minimal computational cost.

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

### [181] [Failure Cases Are Better Learned But Boundary Says Sorry: Facilitating Smooth Perception Change for Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off in Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02186)
*Yanyun Wang,Li Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reveals that over-learning hard adversarial samples in Adversarial Training (AT) degrades decision boundaries, proposing a new method (RPAT) to mitigate the accuracy-robustness trade-off by ensuring smooth perception transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness in AT is traditionally attributed to insufficient learning of hard samples. This work challenges that view, arguing over-learning is the issue.

Method: Introduces Robust Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT), encouraging smooth perception changes with input perturbations to improve decision boundaries.

Result: RPAT outperforms four baselines and 12 SOTA methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with various models.

Conclusion: RPAT effectively addresses the accuracy-robustness trade-off by optimizing perception consistency, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

### [182] [CMIC: Content-Adaptive Mamba for Learned Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02192)
*Yunuo Chen,Zezheng Lyu,Bing He,Hongwei Hu,Qi Wang,Yuan Tian,Li Song,Wenjun Zhang,Guo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic state-space model for learned image compression (LIC) that improves content-aware token reorganization and integrates global priors, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vanilla Mamba's fixed, content-agnostic selective scans limit its ability to exploit content dependencies dynamically, prompting the need for a more adaptive approach.

Method: CAM employs content-aware token clustering/reordering and integrates global priors via a prompt dictionary to enhance token interactions and mitigate causality limitations.

Result: The proposed CMIC model outperforms VTM-21.0 by significant BD-rate margins (-15.91%, -21.34%, -17.58%) on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks.

Conclusion: CAM effectively captures global dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency, setting a new standard in LIC performance.

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

TL;DR: COSFormer is a Transformer-based continual learning framework for multi-task WSI analysis, avoiding full historical dataset revisits and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient, resource-conscious continual learning in WSI analysis due to increasing clinical use and large data sizes.

Method: Introduces COSFormer, a framework for sequential learning from new tasks without retraining on past data, evaluated on seven WSI datasets.

Result: COSFormer shows superior generalizability and effectiveness in class- and task-incremental settings.

Conclusion: COSFormer is a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

### [184] [An Event-based Fast Intensity Reconstruction Scheme for UAV Real-time Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02238)
*Xin Dong,Yiwei Zhang,Yangjie Cui,Jinwu Xiang,Daochun Li,Zhan Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ESI, a streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction method, for efficient onboard implementation of event cameras, offering high frame rates and superior performance in challenging visual conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras have advantages like high dynamic range and immunity to motion blur, but extracting useful information from asynchronous event streams is challenging for onboard applications.

Method: ESI reconstructs intensity images via single integration of event streams and an enhanced decay algorithm, enabling real-time processing at 100 FPS with low computation.

Result: ESI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in runtime efficiency, reconstruction quality, and frame rate, proving effective in UAV visual tracking under low illumination.

Conclusion: ESI enhances UAV onboard perception, especially in adverse visual conditions, where other methods fail due to poor performance or real-time limitations.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

### [185] [Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Confidence-Gated Taylor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02240)
*Xiaoliu Guan,Lielin Jiang,Hanqi Chen,Xu Zhang,Jiaxing Yan,Guanzhong Wang,Yi Liu,Zetao Zhang,Yu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic Taylor-based acceleration method for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to improve inference speed while maintaining quality, achieving significant speedups with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs suffer from low inference speed, limiting their use in low-resource applications. Existing training-free methods cache features but incur memory and computation overhead and lack dynamic adaptation.

Method: The approach shifts Taylor prediction to the last block level, reducing cached features, and introduces a dynamic caching mechanism based on prediction reliability.

Result: Empirical results show 3.17x speedup on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances speed and quality, making DiTs more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel LLM-based framework, Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections, improves multimodal entity linking by prioritizing text and iteratively integrating visual clues when needed, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in current LLM-based methods, such as unnecessary image data use and one-time visual feature extraction, to enhance effectiveness and accuracy.

Method: Proposes a framework that leverages text first, then iteratively integrates key visual clues if text is insufficient, through intra- and inter-modality evaluations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets, achieving improvements of 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances text and visual data, enhancing multimodal entity linking performance.

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

*Yuanbin Fu,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DerProp introduces a derivative label propagation method to improve pseudo-label reliability in semi-supervised semantic segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of pseudo-labels in semi-supervised semantic segmentation and reduce annotation burden.

Method: Uses derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors for regularization, creating strictly regularized similarity metrics.

Result: Effectively constrains solution space, outperforming other methods in experiments.

Conclusion: DerProp enhances pseudo-label reliability and demonstrates superior performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patho-AgenticRAG is a multimodal RAG framework for pathology, addressing hallucinations in VLMs by leveraging joint text-image retrieval from authoritative textbooks, improving diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology VLMs face challenges like ultra-high resolution and complex semantics, leading to hallucinations. Existing RAG methods rely on text-only knowledge, missing visual cues.

Method: Proposes Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with page-level embeddings from pathology textbooks, enabling joint text-image search and reasoning.

Result: Outperforms existing models in tasks like multiple-choice diagnosis and visual question answering.

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG enhances diagnostic accuracy by integrating visual and textual information, addressing limitations of current pathology VLMs.

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSSC introduces a depth-guided initialization and Gaussian aggregator for monocular 3D semantic scene completion, improving efficiency and accuracy over random initialization methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and artifacts from random initialization of 3D Gaussian primitives in monocular 3D semantic scene completion.

Method: Uses depth-guided initialization with a Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion module and a Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator for robust predictions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Occ-ScanNet, with 6.3% IoU and 4.1% mIoU improvements, and reduces latency/memory by 9.3%.

Conclusion: SplatSSC effectively resolves initialization and noise issues, advancing monocular 3D SSC with superior efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

*Peng Zhang,Zhihui Lai,Heng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hermes, a semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for ultrasound image classification and segmentation, addressing issues like incorrect pseudo-labels and lack of task affinity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from overly confident yet incorrect pseudo-labels and fail to explore task affinity between segmentation and classification.

Method: Hermes combines contrastive and semi-supervised learning, uses pseudo-labels for guidance, and includes inter-task attention, saliency, and consistency learning.

Result: Hermes outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public and private ultrasound datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy effectively improves performance by leveraging task affinity and robust pseudo-label selection.

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGAD introduces a novel descriptor network for area matching, improving accuracy and efficiency by avoiding complex graph optimization and using a unique supervision strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing A2PM methods rely on inefficient pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching, limiting scalability.

Method: SGAD generates discriminative area descriptors for direct matching, uses a classification and ranking supervision strategy, and applies HCRF to eliminate overlapping areas.

Result: SGAD reduces runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA and improves accuracy in pose estimation tasks.

Conclusion: SGAD sets a new state-of-the-art in area matching, offering significant runtime and accuracy improvements.

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how edge preprocessing affects foundation models' segmentation performance across medical imaging modalities.

Method: Pre-train foundation models on raw or edge-enhanced data, fine-tune on modality-specific subsets, and use meta-learning for model selection based on image statistics.

Result: Edge-focused pre-training shows mixed results; meta-learning improves overall segmentation performance by 16.42-19.30%.

Conclusion: Selective application of edge-focused pre-training via meta-learning enhances segmentation performance across diverse medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

### [193] [Unleashing the Temporal Potential of Stereo Event Cameras for Continuous-Time 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02288)
*Jae-Young Kang,Hoonhee Cho,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel stereo 3D object detection framework using only event cameras, eliminating conventional sensors, outperforms prior methods in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras' high temporal resolution addresses perception gaps in high-speed scenarios where LiDAR and RGB cameras fail due to fixed frame rates.

Method: Proposes a dual filter mechanism to extract semantic and geometric information from event data and aligns bounding boxes with object-centric information for enhanced regression.

Result: Outperforms prior approaches in dynamic environments, showcasing robust, continuous-time 3D perception.

Conclusion: Event cameras hold potential for robust 3D object detection without relying on conventional sensors, as demonstrated by the proposed framework.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

### [194] [Towards Real Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Via Confident Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02293)
*Muhammad Aqeel,Shakiba Sharifi,Marco Cristani,Francesco Setti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMet introduces a meta-learning strategy for anomaly detection, eliminating the need for curated training data by handling mixed nominal and anomalous samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised anomaly detection assumes all training data are nominal, requiring manual curation and introducing bias. CoMet aims to learn directly from uncurated datasets.

Method: CoMet combines Soft Confident Learning (weighting low-confidence samples less) and Meta-Learning (regularizing updates via validation loss covariance) to stabilize training and prevent overfitting.

Result: CoMet improves performance on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2, outperforming baselines and achieving state-of-the-art results while remaining robust to training anomalies.

Conclusion: CoMet offers a flexible, model-agnostic solution for anomaly detection, reducing reliance on curated data and enhancing robustness.

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

*Dmitrii Seletkov,Sophie Starck,Ayhan Can Erdur,Yundi Zhang,Daniel Rueckert,Rickmer Braren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised whole-body representation learning method improves preclinical disease risk assessment, outperforming radiomics in multiple diseases and enhancing CVD subgroup predictions when combined with cardiac MRI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image-based risk prediction methods are limited by single-condition focus and reliance on hand-crafted features, necessitating a more comprehensive approach.

Method: Proposes a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method under competing risk modeling, validated in diseases like CVD, T2D, COPD, and CKD, and combined with cardiac MRI for CVD subgroups.

Result: Outperforms whole-body radiomics, improves CVD subgroup predictions (IHD, HD, stroke), and demonstrates translational potential for early risk stratification.

Conclusion: The method shows promise as a standalone screening tool or part of multi-modal clinical workflows for personalized risk assessment.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

### [196] [Is Uncertainty Quantification a Viable Alternative to Learned Deferral?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02319)
*Anna M. Wundram,Christian F. Baumgartner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI models for patient care must defer decisions to humans when uncertain. Uncertainty quantification methods outperform learned deferral models, especially under data shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring AI safety in healthcare by improving deferral strategies for misclassification risks, particularly under out-of-distribution conditions.

Method: Comparative evaluation of learned deferral models and uncertainty quantification methods on an ophthalmology dataset for glaucoma classification.

Result: Uncertainty quantification methods show better robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to learned deferral models.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification is a promising approach for AI deferral in clinical settings, enhancing safety and reliability.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

*Gefan Ye,Lin Li,Kexin Li,Jun Xiao,Long chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogicCAR introduces dual symbolic constraints (Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical Primitive Logic) to address spurious correlations and semantic ambiguity in zero-shot compositional action recognition, outperforming baselines on the Sth-com dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in ZS-CAR: spurious correlations due to missing compositional structure and semantic ambiguity from neglecting semantic hierarchy. Human-like symbolic reasoning is proposed as a solution.

Method: LogicCAR integrates dual symbolic constraints (Explicit Compositional Logic for compositional reasoning and Hierarchical Primitive Logic for semantic dependencies) using first-order logic embedded into neural networks.

Result: LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods on the Sth-com dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of its logic-driven constraints.

Conclusion: LogicCAR successfully bridges symbolic abstraction with neural models, enhancing compositional and hierarchical reasoning in ZS-CAR.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

*Philipp Wulff,Felix Wimbauer,Dominik Muhle,Daniel Cremers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for single-image volumetric scene reconstruction using pre-trained 2D diffusion and depth models, outperforming multi-view supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate scene reconstruction from a single image without costly 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision.

Method: Leverages pre-trained 2D diffusion and depth models to generate synthetic geometry, distilling a feed-forward reconstruction model.

Result: Matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets, especially in dynamic scenes.

Conclusion: The approach offers a cost-effective and effective alternative to multi-view supervision for scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad
range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric
reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require
expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage
pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate
synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill
a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging
KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique
advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: Qwen-Image is an advanced image generation model with strong text rendering and editing capabilities, achieved through a comprehensive data pipeline and progressive training strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in complex text rendering and precise image editing, particularly in logographic languages like Chinese.

Method: Uses a comprehensive data pipeline, progressive training strategy, and dual-encoding mechanism for semantic and reconstructive representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation and editing across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image excels in text rendering and image editing, setting new standards in the field.

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: CLIP-IN enhances CLIP's fine-grained visual comprehension using instruction-editing datasets and long captions, improving performance on fine-grained tasks without losing zero-shot capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in detailed visual comprehension.

Method: Uses instruction-editing datasets for hard negative pairs and a symmetric contrastive loss, plus long captions with rotary encodings.

Result: Achieves gains on MMVP benchmark and fine-grained tasks, reduces hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: Targeted contrastive learning with descriptive information improves VLM fine-grained understanding.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a linear-time algorithm for rotation estimation between spherical patterns, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for spherical pattern rotation estimation are computationally expensive (O(n^3)) and lack robustness to outliers.

Method: The authors propose three algorithms: SPMC, FRS, and a hybrid SPMC+FRS, reformulating the problem as a spherical point-set alignment (Wahba problem).

Result: The algorithms are 10x faster and 10x more accurate than state-of-the-art methods, validated on a new dataset and real-world tasks like PCR and spherical image rotation estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer efficient and accurate solutions for spherical pattern alignment, with practical applications in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

*Fan Hu,Zijie Xin,Xirong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LPD (Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces) for Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) to address visual diversity challenges by constructing feature-specific common spaces and using de-correlation loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The visual diversity in AVS makes it hard to retrieve all relevant videos comprehensively, as current solutions overlook diverse spaces.

Method: LPD learns separate common spaces for each feature, uses de-correlation loss, and employs an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking loss.

Result: Experiments on TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) show LPD's effectiveness and ability to enhance result diversity.

Conclusion: LPD successfully addresses AVS challenges by leveraging diverse spaces and de-correlation, improving retrieval comprehensiveness and diversity.

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

TL;DR: A novel framework combines radar and camera data to localize pedestrians in NLoS urban environments, improving accuracy by interpreting radar PCD with visual road layout.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian localization in NLoS regions is challenging due to radar distortions and camera limitations in depth perception.

Method: The framework integrates 2D radar PCD with camera-inferred road layout to reconstruct spatial scenes for NLoS pedestrian localization.

Result: Experiments with a real vehicle-mounted radar-camera system show improved localization performance in outdoor NLoS environments.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses NLoS pedestrian localization challenges, demonstrating practical applicability.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

TL;DR: Text2Lip is a viseme-centric framework for generating talking faces by bridging linguistic meaning and facial articulation, outperforming existing methods in semantic fidelity and visual realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of scalability and robustness in audio-driven methods by leveraging textual input for lip motion prediction.

Method: Uses structured viseme sequences as a linguistic prior, a progressive viseme-audio replacement strategy, and a landmark-guided renderer for photorealistic synthesis.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality robustness.

Conclusion: Text2Lip establishes a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking face generation.

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of balancing reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility in image inversion for practical applications.

Method: Leverages optimal transport theory to guide inversion, computing optimal paths between image and noise distributions for trajectory optimization.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity reconstruction (LPIPS 0.001, SSIM 0.992) and outperforms baselines in reconstruction loss (7.8%-12.9% improvement) and semantic editing (11.2% identity preservation).

Conclusion: OTIP provides superior detail preservation and semantic consistency in image editing, maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of publicly available benchmark datasets capturing real-world port diversity hinders progress in TU identification, impacting logistics efficiency.

Method: The TRUDI dataset includes 35,034 annotated instances across five categories. The TITUS pipeline segments TUs, detects ID text locations, and recognizes/validates IDs, operating under diverse conditions.

Result: TITUS reliably identifies TUs from various camera perspectives and under varying lighting/weather conditions, outperforming systems requiring specific setups.

Conclusion: The TRUDI dataset and TITUS pipeline provide a robust benchmark for TU identification, supporting digital transformation and logistics efficiency in ports.

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

*Shuo Lu,Yanyin Chen,Wei Feng,Jiahao Fan,Fengheng Li,Zheng Zhang,Jingjing Lv,Junjie Shen,Ching Law,Jian Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-Layout is a unified framework for layout generation, human-mimicking evaluation, and alignment, outperforming task-specific and general-purpose methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current layout generation approaches lack universal applicability and effective evaluation metrics, limiting their usefulness.

Method: Uni-Layout integrates a unified generator for various layout tasks, a human-mimicking evaluator using a large-scale feedback dataset (Layout-HF100k), and Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO) for alignment.

Result: Uni-Layout significantly outperforms existing methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances layout generation by unifying tasks, improving evaluation, and aligning generation with human judgment.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

*Chen-Chen Fan,Peiyao Guo,Linping Zhang,Kehan Qi,Haolin Huang,Yong-Qiang Mao,Yuxi Suo,Zhizhuo Jiang,Yu Liu,You He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SMART-Ship, a multi-modal dataset for maritime surveillance, featuring spatiotemporal registered images with fine-grained annotations across five modalities. It supports diverse tasks and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maritime surveillance is challenging due to multi-scale targets and dynamic environments, necessitating a robust multi-modal dataset for accurate analysis.

Method: The authors created SMART-Ship, a dataset with 1092 multi-modal image sets (38,838 ships), annotated with polygonal locations, categories, identifiers, and change masks. Images are spatiotemporally registered and acquired within one week.

Result: The dataset supports five fundamental tasks, with experiments validating its utility for multi-modal remote sensing interpretation.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship effectively bridges gaps in maritime surveillance, offering a valuable resource for multi-modal analysis and future research directions.

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

*Xingyu Feng,Hebei Gao,Hong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model for instance segmentation and object detection, using CutOnce for pseudo labels and self-training for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance unsupervised object localization by simplifying the process of generating pseudo labels and eliminating reliance on clustering or post-processing.

Method: COLER uses CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels in one step, leveraging self-supervised models, and employs self-training for refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks without specialized loss functions.

Conclusion: COLER demonstrates strong performance and simplicity, potentially advancing unsupervised object localization.

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

*Yimeng Liu,Maolin Gan,Huaili Zeng,Li Liu,Younsuk Dong,Zhichao Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hydra integrates mm-Wave radar and camera tech to detect leaf wetness, achieving high accuracy (96%) in varied conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LWD detection lacks standardization and robustness, limiting real-world agricultural applications.

Method: Combines CNN for feature fusion and transformer-based encoder for feature mapping, using FMCW radar (76-81 GHz).

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy in lab and ~90% in real farms under diverse conditions.

Conclusion: Hydra offers a precise, resilient solution for LWD detection in agriculture.

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HGTS-Former, a hypergraph-based transformer for multivariate time series analysis, addressing high dimensionality and complex interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in analyzing complex time series data due to high dimensionality and dynamic interactions motivate the need for a robust model.

Method: HGTS-Former normalizes and embeds time series patches, uses multi-head self-attention, constructs hierarchical hypergraphs, and employs an EdgeToNode module with a feed-forward network.

Result: Experiments on eight datasets validate HGTS-Former's effectiveness in multivariate time series tasks.

Conclusion: HGTS-Former successfully addresses multivariate coupling in time series data, with code available for further use.

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

*Yin Lin,iccardo Barbieri,Domenico Aquino,Giuseppe Lauria,Marina Grisoli,Elena De Momi,Alberto Redaelli,Simona Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An AI-based method using Vision Transformers (ViTs) predicts glioblastoma survival from MRI images without tumor segmentation, achieving 62.5% accuracy on the BRATS dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting Overall Survival (OS) for glioblastoma patients is crucial for personalized treatment and clinical decision-making.

Method: The study employs Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract features directly from MRI images, bypassing the need for tumor segmentation.

Result: The model achieved 62.5% accuracy on the BRATS test set, with balanced precision, recall, and F1 scores, outperforming other methods.

Conclusion: ViTs show promise for OS prediction in medical imaging, offering computational efficiency and eliminating segmentation reliance, though dataset size limits generalization.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

*Junxiao Xue,Xiaozhen Liu,Xuecheng Wu,Fei Yu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoSyncNet improves lip-reading accuracy in silent videos using non-uniform sequence modeling and tailored data augmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on LRW and LRW1000 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lip-reading from silent videos is vital for Assistive Technology and Augmented Reality but is challenging due to variability in lip movements and uneven information distribution.

Method: InfoSyncNet employs a non-uniform quantization module between encoder and decoder, along with tailored data augmentation and training strategies to handle visual speech inconsistencies.

Result: The model achieves 92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 accuracy on LRW and LRW1000 datasets, setting new benchmarks.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet effectively addresses challenges in lip-reading, demonstrating superior performance and potential for practical applications.

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

### [214] [SAMPO: Visual Preference Optimization for Intent-Aware Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02464)
*Yonghuang Wu,Wenwen Zeng,Xuan Xie,Chengqian Zhao,Guoqing Wu,Jinhua Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMPO bridges the intent gap in SAM by optimizing for high-level categorical intent from sparse prompts, achieving superior performance in dense object segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's limitation in segmenting implicitly desired objects in dense, homogeneous domains (e.g., biomedical nuclei) necessitates a solution to infer user intent without dense annotations.

Method: SAMPO uses preference optimization to teach visual foundation models to capture target-class characteristics implicitly, avoiding pixel-level fine-tuning and language model dependencies.

Result: SAMPO outperforms baselines, achieving a 9+ percentage point improvement on PanNuke-T2 with only 10% training data.

Conclusion: SAMPO introduces a new paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual models, eliminating reliance on auxiliary prompt generators or language models.

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

*Jaehyuk Heo,Pilsung Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a framework for multi-class image anomaly detection that works with or without class labels, outperforming existing methods across various scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underperformance of single multi-class models compared to class-specific ones and the understudied role of class information in defining detection thresholds.

Method: Proposes HierCore, a hierarchical memory bank-based framework to estimate class-wise decision criteria for anomaly detection, even without class labels.

Result: HierCore consistently meets all defined requirements and performs robustly across four scenarios involving the presence or absence of class labels in training and evaluation.

Conclusion: HierCore is a practical and effective solution for real-world multi-class anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating stability and adaptability.

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

*Xinquan Yu,Wei Lu,Xiangyang Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation, addressing limitations of existing methods by incorporating modality reliability, unimodal internal, and cross-modal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for detecting multi-modal media manipulation suffer from unreliable unimodal data and lack comprehensive forgery supervision, limiting performance.

Method: The FMS network includes three modules: Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) for modality reliability, Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) for internal supervision, and Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) for cross-modal supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments show FMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation.

Conclusion: The FMS network effectively addresses the challenges of multi-modal media manipulation detection by integrating comprehensive supervision mechanisms.

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: A novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction addresses signal mixing, temporal resolution mismatch, and dataset limitations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding visual cognition and enabling brain-computer interfaces require reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI, but current methods are limited to single-shot clips.

Method: Proposes a framework with shot boundary prediction, generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, and large-scale data synthesis.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with fMRI decomposition improving caption similarity by 71.8%.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction by leveraging decomposition and semantic prompting.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

*Jianchao Wang,Peng Zhou,Cen Li,Rong Quan,Jie Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EFA-GS reduces floating artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting by expanding under-optimized Gaussians and using depth/scale strategies, improving PSNR by 1.68 dB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating artifacts in 3DGS degrade visual fidelity, especially with low-quality initialization. Their origins are not fully understood.

Method: Proposes EFA-GS, which expands under-optimized Gaussians for better low-frequency learning and uses depth/scale strategies to refine expansion.

Result: EFA-GS reduces artifacts, preserves details, and improves PSNR by 1.68 dB on RWLQ dataset. Effective in 3D editing tasks.

Conclusion: EFA-GS effectively mitigates floating artifacts while maintaining detail, validated by experiments and downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

### [219] [Rethinking Transparent Object Grasping: Depth Completion with Monocular Depth Estimation and Instance Mask](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02507)
*Yaofeng Cheng,Xinkai Gao,Sen Zhang,Chao Zeng,Fusheng Zha,Lining Sun,Chenguang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMake is a depth completion framework for transparent objects, using instance masks and monocular depth to improve accuracy and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depth cameras struggle with transparent objects, leading to incomplete data and unreliable robotic grasping. Existing methods fail to generalize to real-world scenarios.

Method: ReMake uses instance masks to identify transparent regions and monocular depth for context, focusing learning on accurate depth estimation.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy and generalization on benchmarks and real-world tests.

Conclusion: ReMake effectively addresses depth completion for transparent objects, improving robotic grasping reliability.

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores large multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction, comparing VideoLLaMA2 (audio, visual, language) and Qwen2.5-VL (visual, language). VideoLLaMA2 outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, emphasizing audio's role. Their ensemble method wins the ICCV VQualA 2025 challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting video engagement is crucial for recommendation systems and content creation, but existing methods struggle with cross-modality interactions.

Method: Uses VideoLLaMA2 and Qwen2.5-VL LMMs, trained on SnapUGC dataset, to model multimodal features (audio, visual, text).

Result: VideoLLaMA2 outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, showing audio's importance. Ensemble method achieves top performance in ICCV challenge.

Conclusion: LMMs are effective for engagement prediction, with audio features playing a key role. The ensemble approach sets a new benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how asphalt art affects pedestrian detection in surveillance systems, considering both benign and adversarial cases.

Method: Constructed realistic crosswalk scenarios with various street art patterns and evaluated a pretrained object detection model's performance.

Result: Complex artistic patterns degrade detection, and adversarial designs can obscure or fake pedestrians.

Conclusion: Urban surveillance systems must account for visual variations to ensure robust pedestrian detection.

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

### [222] [Precision-Aware Video Compression for Reducing Bandwidth Requirements in Video Communication for Vehicle Detection-Based Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02533)
*Abyad Enan,Jon C Calhoun,Mashrur Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAVC dynamically adjusts video compression based on weather/lighting to optimize bandwidth and maintain vehicle detection accuracy in ITS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited bandwidth in ITS can hinder real-time performance, and lossy compression degrades video quality, impacting vehicle detection accuracy. Environmental factors further complicate this.

Method: Uses Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC) to dynamically adjust compression levels based on weather and lighting conditions, balancing bandwidth and detection accuracy.

Result: PAVC improves vehicle detection accuracy by up to 13%, reduces bandwidth by 8.23x in moderate areas, and by 72x in severely limited bandwidth areas.

Conclusion: PAVC effectively balances bandwidth efficiency and detection accuracy, enhancing ITS performance under varying conditions.

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

*Shuo Wang,Yongcai Wang,Wanting Li,Yucheng Wang,Maiyue Chen,Kaihui Wang,Zhizhong Su,Xudong Cai,Yeying Jin,Deying Li,Zhaoxin Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoDream is a lightweight Vision-Language Action (VLA) framework that improves monocular navigation by learning a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR) and using Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to predict panoramic features from monocular input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the cost and accessibility issues of panoramic RGB-D sensors in Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks while narrowing the performance gap between monocular and panoramic-based agents.

Method: MonoDream learns a UNR aligning visual semantics and language-grounded action intent, and introduces LPD tasks to predict latent panoramic features from monocular input.

Result: MonoDream improves monocular navigation performance and significantly reduces the gap with panoramic-based agents on multiple VLN benchmarks.

Conclusion: MonoDream demonstrates that lightweight monocular agents can achieve competitive navigation performance by leveraging shared feature representations and predictive tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

*Zhengdao Li,Siheng Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMoMask is a unified framework for text-to-motion generation, addressing limitations in diversity, physical plausibility, and retrieval precision with innovations like bidirectional momentum and semantic spatio-temporal attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-motion methods struggle with diversity, error accumulation, and asynchronous artifacts, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: ReMoMask integrates bidirectional momentum text-motion models, semantic spatio-temporal attention, and RAG-classifier-free guidance to improve motion generation.

Result: ReMoMask outperforms previous methods, achieving 3.88% and 10.97% FID score improvements on HumanML3D and KIT-ML benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReMoMask sets a new state-of-the-art for text-to-motion generation by combining retrieval and generative approaches effectively.

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

### [225] [Evaluating Variance in Visual Question Answering Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02645)
*Nikitha SR*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper critiques current evaluation practices for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in Visual Question Answering (VQA), highlighting performance variance due to stochastic factors. It proposes variance-aware methodologies and explores Cloze-style evaluation for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA benchmarks for MLLMs rely on point estimates, ignoring performance variance caused by stochastic outputs, training seeds, and hyperparameters. This limits robust model development.

Method: The study analyzes variance across 14 VQA benchmarks, examining factors like training seed, framework non-determinism, model scale, and instruction finetuning. It also tests Cloze-style evaluation to reduce stochasticity.

Result: Findings reveal significant performance variability due to the studied factors, underscoring the limitations of current evaluation practices. Cloze-style evaluation shows promise in improving reliability.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for variance-aware evaluation methodologies to enhance the robustness and reliability of MLLMs in VQA tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

*Yijun Xu,Jingrui Zhang,Yuhan Chen,Dingwen Wang,Lei Yu,Chu He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PMGS reconstructs projectile motion using 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing challenges in dynamic reconstruction with physics-based constraints and adaptive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with long-term, large-scale rigid motion and lack physical consistency.

Method: Two-stage workflow: Target Modeling (dynamic scene decomposition, point density control) and Motion Recovery (SE(3) pose learning). Includes acceleration consistency, adaptive learning rates, and Kalman fusion.

Result: PMGS outperforms mainstream methods in reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion.

Conclusion: PMGS effectively addresses dynamic reconstruction challenges with physics-aware constraints and adaptive strategies.

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

*Xiaoke Huang,Juncheng Wu,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVLThinker introduces open, reproducible baselines for reasoning-centric medical LMMs, with RLVR outperforming SFT and text-only data proving more effective than multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of open recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs limits research and comparison.

Method: Systematic data curation and two training paradigms: SFT on reasoning traces and RLVR based on answer correctness.

Result: RLVR outperforms SFT; text-only data boosts performance more than multimodal data. A 7B model sets a new SOTA, and scaling to 32B matches GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The released data, models, and code provide a strong open foundation for future medical reasoning research.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

*Haoyang Li,Liang Wang,Chao Wang,Siyu Zhou,Jing Jiang,Yan Peng,Guodong Long*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AugPT is a self-contained prompt tuning method using internal augmentation to enhance model performance without external knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on costly external knowledge and ignore image modality features.

Method: Uses self-supervised augmentation and a gating mechanism to filter noisy samples.

Result: Improves performance and generalization without external knowledge.

Conclusion: AugPT is effective and efficient for CLIP-based prompt tuning.

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a typology for classifying autonomous AI systems based on eight dimensions of cognitive and environmental agency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of a structured framework for comparing and classifying increasingly autonomous AI systems.

Method: A multi-phase approach involving typology construction, refinement, and evaluation through a human-AI hybrid method.

Result: A typology enabling analysis of AI agency levels, aiding in assessing current systems and predicting future developments.

Conclusion: The framework provides a structured perspective on AI capabilities, supporting research and practical applications in agentic AI.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into
autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human
intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking
to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of
agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive
and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase
methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then
evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into
constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to
analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured
perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a
foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments
in agentic AI.

### [230] [A Formal Framework for the Definition of 'State': Hierarchical Representation and Meta-Universe Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00853)
*Kei Itoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a unified formal structure for the concept of 'state' to strengthen theoretical foundations, proposing a hierarchical state grid and an Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) for meta-level operations. It expands inter-universal theory to include linguistics and agent integration, offering a meta-formal logical framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consensus and formal clarity in the concept of 'state' and provide a rigorous foundation for diverse systems, including intelligence.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical state grid and introduces the IMU for meta-level operations, expanding inter-universal theory to linguistics and agent integration.

Result: A meta-formal logical framework grounded in the principle of definition = state, applicable to intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory.

Conclusion: The study provides a mathematically robust and unified framework for understanding states, enabling broader expressivity and avoiding logical inconsistencies.

Abstract: This study aims to reinforce the theoretical foundation for diverse
systems--including the axiomatic definition of intelligence--by introducing a
mathematically rigorous and unified formal structure for the concept of
'state,' which has long been used without consensus or formal clarity. First, a
'hierarchical state grid' composed of two axes--state depth and mapping
hierarchy--is proposed to provide a unified notational system applicable across
mathematical, physical, and linguistic domains. Next, the 'Intermediate
Meta-Universe (IMU)' is introduced to enable explicit descriptions of definers
(ourselves) and the languages we use, thereby allowing conscious meta-level
operations while avoiding self-reference and logical inconsistency. Building on
this meta-theoretical foundation, this study expands inter-universal theory
beyond mathematics to include linguistic translation and agent integration,
introducing the conceptual division between macrocosm-inter-universal and
microcosm-inter-universal operations for broader expressivity. Through these
contributions, this paper presents a meta-formal logical framework--grounded in
the principle of definition = state--that spans time, language, agents, and
operations, providing a mathematically robust foundation applicable to the
definition of intelligence, formal logic, and scientific theory at large.

*Fali Wang,Hui Liu,Zhenwei Dai,Jingying Zeng,Zhiwei Zhang,Zongyu Wu,Chen Luo,Zhen Li,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentTTS, an LLM-agent framework, optimizes compute resources for multi-stage tasks, outperforming traditional methods in efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling (TTS) research focuses on single-stage tasks, but real-world problems are multi-stage, requiring tailored LLM capabilities and budget allocations.

Method: AgentTTS uses iterative feedback-driven interactions to autonomously search for compute-optimal allocations in multi-stage tasks, informed by empirical insights from pilot experiments.

Result: AgentTTS outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, robustness, and interpretability.

Conclusion: AgentTTS effectively addresses the challenges of compute-optimal scaling in multi-stage tasks, offering a practical and efficient solution.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

### [232] [ff4ERA: A new Fuzzy Framework for Ethical Risk Assessment in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00899)
*Abeer Dyoub,Ivan Letteri,Francesca A. Lisi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework for Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) in Symbiotic AI, combining Fuzzy Logic, FAHP, and Certainty Factors to quantify and prioritize ethical risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The deepening human-AI collaboration in Symbiotic AI raises ethical risks, necessitating a flexible, transparent, and robust framework for ERA to align AI actions with human values.

Method: The ff4ERA framework integrates Fuzzy Logic, FAHP, and Certainty Factors to compute an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type, combining weights, propagated certainty, and risk levels.

Result: A case study confirms ff4ERA produces context-sensitive, interpretable risk scores, robust to unrelated inputs, with expert-defined weights and certainty factors being dominant influences.

Conclusion: ff4ERA enables interpretable, traceable ethical assessments, supporting what-if analyses and guiding designers in ethical decision-making for Symbiotic AI.

Abstract: The emergence of Symbiotic AI (SAI) introduces new challenges to ethical
decision-making as it deepens human-AI collaboration. As symbiosis grows, AI
systems pose greater ethical risks, including harm to human rights and trust.
Ethical Risk Assessment (ERA) thus becomes crucial for guiding decisions that
minimize such risks. However, ERA is hindered by uncertainty, vagueness, and
incomplete information, and morality itself is context-dependent and imprecise.
This motivates the need for a flexible, transparent, yet robust framework for
ERA. Our work supports ethical decision-making by quantitatively assessing and
prioritizing multiple ethical risks so that artificial agents can select
actions aligned with human values and acceptable risk levels. We introduce
ff4ERA, a fuzzy framework that integrates Fuzzy Logic, the Fuzzy Analytic
Hierarchy Process (FAHP), and Certainty Factors (CF) to quantify ethical risks
via an Ethical Risk Score (ERS) for each risk type. The final ERS combines the
FAHP-derived weight, propagated CF, and risk level. The framework offers a
robust mathematical approach for collaborative ERA modeling and systematic,
step-by-step analysis. A case study confirms that ff4ERA yields
context-sensitive, ethically meaningful risk scores reflecting both expert
input and sensor-based evidence. Risk scores vary consistently with relevant
factors while remaining robust to unrelated inputs. Local sensitivity analysis
shows predictable, mostly monotonic behavior across perturbations, and global
Sobol analysis highlights the dominant influence of expert-defined weights and
certainty factors, validating the model design. Overall, the results
demonstrate ff4ERA ability to produce interpretable, traceable, and risk-aware
ethical assessments, enabling what-if analyses and guiding designers in
calibrating membership functions and expert judgments for reliable ethical
decision support.

*Kenneth Payne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper tests Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory with Large Language Models (LLMs), finding similarities to human risk judgment and highlighting the role of context (e.g., military vs. civilian scenarios) in framing effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LLMs exhibit human-like risk judgment biases as described in prospect theory and how contextual framing influences these biases.

Method: Experimental tests of prospect theory with LLMs, including state-of-the-art chain-of-thought reasoning models, across various scenarios.

Result: LLMs often align with prospect theory, showing framing effects similar to humans, with stronger biases in military contexts. The findings suggest LLMs capture human heuristics and biases unevenly.

Conclusion: LLMs reflect human risk biases, but these are context-dependent. The research reframes debates about reasoning vs. memorization in LLMs, emphasizing the role of language and framing.

Abstract: Judgment of risk is key to decision-making under uncertainty. As Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky famously discovered, humans do so in a distinctive
way that departs from mathematical rationalism. Specifically, they demonstrated
experimentally that humans accept more risk when they feel themselves at risk
of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

TL;DR: CHECK, a knowledge editor for multi-hop question answering (MQA), improves accuracy by 22.8% by analyzing and revising reasoning chains semantically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editors fail in compositional reasoning tasks like MQA due to illogical decompositional techniques.

Method: CHECK uses semantic analysis inspired by compilers, revising reasoning chains through logic optimization and re-prompting at higher temperatures.

Result: CHECK outperforms five state-of-the-art frameworks, achieving 22.8% higher MQA accuracy on four datasets.

Conclusion: CHECK effectively addresses compositional reasoning challenges in knowledge editing for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require lightweight avenues of updating stored
information that has fallen out of date. Knowledge Editing (KE) approaches have
been successful in updating model knowledge for simple factual queries but
struggle with handling tasks that require compositional reasoning such as
multi-hop question answering (MQA). We observe that existing knowledge editors
leverage decompositional techniques that result in illogical reasoning
processes. In this paper, we propose a knowledge editor for MQA based on
semantic analysis called CHECK. Our framework is based on insights from an
analogy between compilers and reasoning using LLMs. Similar to how source code
is first compiled before being executed, we propose to semantically analyze
reasoning chains before executing the chains to answer questions. Reasoning
chains with semantic errors are revised to ensure consistency through logic
optimization and re-prompting the LLM model at a higher temperature. We
evaluate the effectiveness of CHECK against five state-of-the-art frameworks on
four datasets and achieve an average 22.8% improved MQA accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoEDA is a framework for automating EDA workflows using structured prompt engineering and paralleled learning, reducing fine-tuning needs and improving script quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scripting and tool-specific interactions in EDA workflows limit scalability and efficiency, while existing LLM solutions lack standardized frameworks.

Method: AutoEDA uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) for paralleled learning, structured prompt engineering, intelligent parameter extraction, and task decomposition. It also introduces an extended CodeBLEU metric for evaluation.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show improved automation accuracy, efficiency, and script quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: AutoEDA provides a scalable, efficient, and open-source solution for EDA automation, benefiting the EDA community.

Abstract: Modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows, especially the
RTL-to-GDSII flow, require heavily manual scripting and demonstrate a multitude
of tool-specific interactions which limits scalability and efficiency. While
LLMs introduces strides for automation, existing LLM solutions require
expensive fine-tuning and do not contain standardized frameworks for
integration and evaluation. We introduce AutoEDA, a framework for EDA
automation that leverages paralleled learning through the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) specific for standardized and scalable natural language
experience across the entire RTL-to-GDSII flow. AutoEDA limits fine-tuning

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower the expertise barrier and enhance efficiency in CAD design by leveraging LLMs for interactive and intuitive design support.

Method: The agent uses a Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP) to generate CAD code, incorporates iterative visual feedback, and stores cases in a knowledge base for continuous improvement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Conclusion: The proposed agent effectively bridges the gap between novice designers and CAD tools, improving accessibility and design quality.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REACT is a real-time V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework using a lightweight VLM for autonomous driving, achieving improved safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-error collisions are common in multi-vehicle crashes, necessitating better autonomous driving systems with cooperative perception via V2X communication. Current transformer-based V2X frameworks lack generalization and real-time performance.

Method: REACT uses a fine-tuned lightweight VLM with specialized modules for multimodal input processing and edge adaptation strategies to ensure real-time performance.

Result: REACT reduces collision rates by 77%, achieves 48.2% VPQ, and 0.57-second inference latency on Jetson AGX Orin, outperforming benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lightweight VLMs like REACT are feasible for real-time edge-based cooperative planning, enhancing safety and responsiveness in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Collisions caused by human error are the most common type of multi-vehicle
crash, highlighting the critical need for autonomous driving (AD) systems to
leverage cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)
communication. This capability extends situational awareness beyond the
limitations of onboard sensors. However, current transformer-based V2X
frameworks suffer from limited generalization, shallow contextual reasoning,
and reliance on mono-modal inputs. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer enhanced
reasoning and multimodal integration but typically fall short of real-time
performance requirements in safety-critical applications. This paper presents
REACT, a real-time, V2X-integrated trajectory optimization framework built upon
a fine-tuned lightweight VLM. REACT integrates a set of specialized modules
that process multimodal inputs into optimized, risk-aware trajectories. To
ensure real-time performance on edge devices, REACT incorporates edge
adaptation strategies that reduce model complexity and accelerate inference.
Evaluated on the DeepAccident benchmark, REACT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, a 77% collision rate reduction, a 48.2% Video Panoptic Quality
(VPQ), and a 0.57-second inference latency on the Jetson AGX Orin. Ablation
studies validate the contribution of each input, module, and edge adaptation
strategy. These results demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight VLMs for
real-time edge-based cooperative planning and showcase the potential of
language-guided contextual reasoning to improve safety and responsiveness in
autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating KG embeddings at web scale efficiently motivates the development of gpuRDF2vec.

Method: gpuRDF2vec leverages modern GPUs and multi-node execution to accelerate all stages of the RDF2vec pipeline, including walk extraction and embedding training.

Result: Experiments show gpuRDF2vec achieves significant speedups over alternatives like jRDF2vec, especially in walk extraction on large/dense graphs.

Conclusion: gpuRDF2vec enables efficient, high-quality KG embedding training on large-scale graphs, leveraging Pytorch Lightning for scalability.

Abstract: Generating Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings at web scale remains challenging.
Among existing techniques, RDF2vec combines effectiveness with strong
scalability. We present gpuRDF2vec, an open source library that harnesses
modern GPUs and supports multi-node execution to accelerate every stage of the
RDF2vec pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetically generated graphs
and real-world benchmarks show that gpuRDF2vec achieves up to a substantial
speedup over the currently fastest alternative, i.e., jRDF2vec. In a
single-node setup, our walk-extraction phase alone outperforms pyRDF2vec,
SparkKGML, and jRDF2vec by a substantial margin using random walks on large/
dense graphs, and scales very well to longer walks, which typically lead to
better quality embeddings. Our implementation of gpuRDF2vec enables
practitioners and researchers to train high-quality KG embeddings on
large-scale graphs within practical time budgets and builds on top of Pytorch
Lightning for the scalable word2vec implementation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reveals a hidden tipping instability in generative AI outputs, linking it to a multispin thermal system, and provides a formula to predict this tipping point, aiding AI transparency and risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of generative AI outputs unpredictably shifting from correct to misleading, causing significant real-world harm, and to improve AI transparency and explainability.

Method: The authors establish a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, derive a formula for the tipping point, and analyze how output tipping is amplified by the AI's architecture.

Result: They identify a hidden tipping instability at the AI's basic attention head scale and provide an exact formula to predict it, showing the influence of user prompts and training bias.

Conclusion: The findings enhance AI transparency, explainability, and performance, while also offering a way to quantify user risk and legal liabilities.

Abstract: Output from generative AI such as ChatGPT, can be repetitive and biased. But
more worrying is that this output can mysteriously tip mid-response from good
(correct) to bad (misleading or wrong) without the user noticing. In 2024
alone, this reportedly caused $67 billion in losses and several deaths.
Establishing a mathematical mapping to a multispin thermal system, we reveal a
hidden tipping instability at the scale of the AI's 'atom' (basic Attention
head). We derive a simple but essentially exact formula for this tipping point
which shows directly the impact of a user's prompt choice and the AI's training
bias. We then show how the output tipping can get amplified by the AI's
multilayer architecture. As well as helping improve AI transparency,
explainability and performance, our results open a path to quantifying users'
AI risk and legal liabilities.

*Satiyabooshan Murugaboopathy,Connor T. Jerzak,Adel Daoud*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores using satellite imagery and Internet-sourced text to predict household wealth in African neighborhoods, finding that combining vision and language models outperforms vision-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if socio-economic indicators like wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite images and online text, leveraging multimodal data for improved prediction.

Method: Developed a multimodal framework with five pipelines: vision model on satellite images, LLM using location/year, AI agent retrieving web text, joint image-text encoder, and an ensemble.

Result: Fusing vision and language models outperformed vision-only baselines (R-squared 0.77 vs. 0.63). LLM knowledge was more effective than agent-retrieved text, and partial representational convergence was observed.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal fusion for wealth prediction, releases a large-scale dataset, and supports the Platonic Representation Hypothesis while partially challenging the Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis.

Abstract: We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave
recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and
Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair
Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on
location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We
develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International
Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images,
(ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web
text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework
yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms
vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on
out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than
agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time
generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused
embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine
similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of
material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms
agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest
gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that
agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not
fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale
multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite
images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.

*Yunlong Lin,Zirui Li,Guodong Du,Xiaocong Zhao,Cheng Gong,Xinwei Wang,Chao Lu,Jianwei Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: H2C, a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method, reduces catastrophic forgetting in trajectory prediction by 22.71% using selective memory replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based trajectory prediction methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting real-world applicability in dynamic scenarios.

Method: H2C uses two strategies for selective sample recall (diversity maximization and equiprobable sampling) and updates via a memory replay loss.

Result: H2C reduces catastrophic forgetting by 22.71% on average in task-free scenarios.

Conclusion: H2C effectively retains prior knowledge while adapting to new data, enhancing DL-based trajectory prediction for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown state-of-the-art performance in trajectory
prediction, which is critical to safe navigation in autonomous driving (AD).
However, most DL-based methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where
adapting to a new distribution may cause significant performance degradation in
previously learned ones. Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits
their applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across
varying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the
hippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively
reconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,
we propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for
trajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by
selectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two
complementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent
learned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity
to represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall
knowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss
function calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while
learning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION
dataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C
reduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a
task-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.

### [243] [Benchmarking and Bridging Emotion Conflicts for Multimodal Emotion Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01181)
*Zhiyuan Han,Beier Zhu,Yanlong Xu,Peipei Song,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces CA-MER, a benchmark for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in emotion conflict scenarios, and proposes MoSEAR, a framework to address audio bias and improve balanced modality integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs often ignore emotion conflicts where cues from different modalities are inconsistent, leading to biased reliance on audio signals.

Method: MoSEAR combines modality-specific experts (MoSE) with a gating mechanism and an attention reallocation (AR) mechanism to balance modality contributions.

Result: MoSEAR outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and CA-MER, especially in conflict scenarios.

Conclusion: MoSEAR effectively mitigates modality bias and enhances performance without trade-offs, making it a robust solution for emotion reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving
emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are
inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark
designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of
three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or
all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER
reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on
audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual
modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient
framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two
modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism
that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention
reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen
backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it
mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent
samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.
Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our
CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,
particularly under modality conflict conditions.

TL;DR: A survey on agent workflow systems in LLMs, classifying frameworks by capabilities and architecture, comparing 20+ systems, and addressing challenges like optimization, security, and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To review and classify agent workflow systems in LLMs, highlighting their importance for scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors.

Method: Comprehensive review and classification of academic and industrial agent workflow systems along functional and architectural dimensions, comparing 20+ systems.

Result: Identified common patterns, technical challenges, and trends, with insights on optimization, security, and open problems like standardization.

Conclusion: Agent workflow systems are crucial for AI scalability and safety, with future research needed in standardization and multimodal integration.

Abstract: In the age of large language models (LLMs), autonomous agents have emerged as
a powerful paradigm for achieving general intelligence. These agents
dynamically leverage tools, memory, and reasoning capabilities to accomplish
user-defined goals. As agent systems grow in complexity, agent
workflows-structured orchestration frameworks-have become central to enabling
scalable, controllable, and secure AI behaviors. This survey provides a
comprehensive review of agent workflow systems, spanning academic frameworks
and industrial implementations. We classify existing systems along two key
dimensions: functional capabilities (e.g., planning, multi-agent collaboration,
external API integration) and architectural features (e.g., agent roles,
orchestration flows, specification languages). By comparing over 20
representative systems, we highlight common patterns, potential technical
challenges, and emerging trends. We further address concerns related to
workflow optimization strategies and security. Finally, we outline open
problems such as standardization and multimodal integration, offering insights
for future research at the intersection of agent design, workflow
infrastructure, and safe automation.

### [245] [Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage? A Data Distribution Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01191)
*Chengshuai Zhao,Zhen Tan,Pingchuan Ma,Dawei Li,Bohan Jiang,Yancheng Wang,Yingzhen Yang,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, revealing it as a superficial process tied to training data distribution, failing beyond familiar contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether CoT reasoning in LLMs is a genuine inferential process or merely a learned pattern from training data.

Method: The study uses DataAlchemy, a controlled environment, to train LLMs from scratch and systematically test CoT reasoning across task, length, and format dimensions under varied distribution conditions.

Result: CoT reasoning is fragile and fails when tested beyond the training data distribution, indicating it lacks genuine generalizability.

Conclusion: CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage, highlighting the challenge of achieving true, generalizable reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BIS is a prompt-centric framework for evaluating LLM performance in code generation without ground truth, reducing costs and contamination risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high costs and data contamination risks in existing benchmarks for LLM code generation evaluation.

Method: Uses importance sampling theory and Importance Weighted Autoencoders to reweight samples from existing benchmarks, with weight truncation for stability.

Result: Achieves low prediction errors (e.g., 1.1% for code correctness) across diverse benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: BIS reliably reduces benchmarking costs and effort, offering quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination assessment.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models , code generation has
become a key benchmark for evaluating LLM capabilities. However, existing
benchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing
high-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk
of data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation
framework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code
generation tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates
performance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on
importance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted
Autoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks
to estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,
we introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations
across the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that
supports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,
offering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination
assessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points
across 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an
average absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with
best- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes
well to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.
These results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which
can significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in
code-related tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel fault detection method integrates significance testing and conformal prediction for rigorous risk control and uncertainty quantification, ensuring reliable fault diagnosis even under distributional shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing diagnostic models, especially in complex scenarios like distributional shifts.

Method: Transforms fault detection into hypothesis testing using a nonconformity measure based on model residuals, computes p-values via a calibration dataset, and constructs prediction sets with formal risk guarantees.

Result: Achieves empirical coverage at or above the nominal level (1-α), robust even with poor point-prediction models, and shows a controllable trade-off between risk level (α) and efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretically grounded framework for explicit risk control in fault detection, enhancing trustworthiness in safety-critical applications and advancing uncertainty-aware outputs.

Abstract: Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern
industrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of
rigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing
diagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as
distributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault
detection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal
prediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms
fault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity
measure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to
compute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets
mathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified
probability, $1-\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by
analyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined
normal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault
diagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The
proposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above
the nominal level ($1-\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the
underlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results
reveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\alpha$)
and efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction
set sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for
fault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the
trustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and
advancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,
uncertainty-aware outputs.

TL;DR: SketchAgent automates converting hand-drawn sketches into structured diagrams using multi-agent integration of recognition, reasoning, and validation, evaluated via the Sketch2Diagram Benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-drawn sketches are ambiguous and lack structural precision, making automated diagram generation challenging.

Method: SketchAgent combines sketch recognition, symbolic reasoning, and iterative validation to transform sketches into diagrams.

Result: The system produces semantically coherent diagrams, reducing manual effort, and is evaluated on a dataset of 6,000 annotated examples.

Conclusion: SketchAgent bridges the gap between sketching and machine-readable diagrams, with applications in design, education, and engineering.

Abstract: Hand-drawn sketches are a natural and efficient medium for capturing and
conveying ideas. Despite significant advancements in controllable natural image
generation, translating freehand sketches into structured, machine-readable
diagrams remains a labor-intensive and predominantly manual task. The primary
challenge stems from the inherent ambiguity of sketches, which lack the
structural constraints and semantic precision required for automated diagram
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce SketchAgent, a multi-agent
system designed to automate the transformation of hand-drawn sketches into
structured diagrams. SketchAgent integrates sketch recognition, symbolic
reasoning, and iterative validation to produce semantically coherent and
structurally accurate diagrams, significantly reducing the need for manual
effort. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we propose the
Sketch2Diagram Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework
encompassing eight diverse diagram categories, such as flowcharts, directed
graphs, and model architectures. The dataset comprises over 6,000 high-quality
examples with token-level annotations, standardized preprocessing, and rigorous
quality control. By streamlining the diagram generation process, SketchAgent
holds great promise for applications in design, education, and engineering,
while offering a significant step toward bridging the gap between intuitive
sketching and machine-readable diagram generation. The benchmark is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between model capacity and computational efficiency in language modeling.

Method: Uses fine-grained expert routing, shared expert isolation, and gradient-conflict-free load balancing.

Result: Achieves 68% KV cache memory reduction, 3.2x inference speedup, and competitive perplexity. Outperforms vanilla transformers by 6.9% in validation loss with 42% fewer active parameters.

Conclusion: Architectural innovation, not parameter scaling, defines efficiency in resource-constrained language model deployment.

Abstract: We present MoE-MLA-RoPE, a novel architecture combination that combines
Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Rotary
Position Embeddings (RoPE) for efficient language modeling. Our approach
addresses the fundamental trade-off between model capacity and computational
efficiency through three key innovations: (1) fine-grained expert routing with
64 micro-experts and top-$k$ selection, enabling flexible specialization
through 3.6 * 10^7 possible expert combinations; (2) shared expert isolation
that dedicates 2 always active experts for common patterns while routing to 6
of 62 specialized experts; and (3) gradient-conflict-free load balancing that
maintains expert utilization without interfering with primary loss
optimization.
  Extensive experiments on models ranging from 17M to 202M parameters
demonstrate that MoE-MLA-RoPE with compression ratio r=d/2 achieves 68% KV
cache memory reduction and 3.2x inference speedup while maintaining competitive
perplexity (0.8% degradation). Compared to the parameters with 53.9M
parameters, MoE-MLA-RoPE improves the validation loss by 6.9% over the vanilla
transformers while using 42% fewer active parameters per forward pass.
FLOP-matched experiments reveal even larger gains: 11.1% improvement with 3.2x
inference acceleration. Automated evaluation using GPT-4 as a judge confirms
quality improvements in generation, with higher scores on coherence (8.1/10),
creativity (7.9/10) and grammatical correctness (8.2/10). Our results establish
that architectural novelty, not parameter scaling, defines the efficiency
frontier for resource-constrained language model deployment.

TL;DR: The paper investigates membership inference attacks (MIAs) on small language models (SLMs), proposing a new attack called win-k that outperforms existing methods, especially on smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLMs are widely used in resource-constrained environments, but their vulnerability to MIAs is understudied. The effectiveness of MIAs decreases with model size, prompting the need for a more effective attack.

Method: The authors propose win-k, an improved MIA based on the state-of-the-art min-k attack, and evaluate it against five existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs.

Result: Win-k outperforms existing MIAs in AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR metrics, particularly on smaller models.

Conclusion: The study highlights the vulnerability of SLMs to MIAs and demonstrates the superiority of win-k, providing insights for future privacy protection in SLMs.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly valued for their efficiency and
deployability in resource-constrained environments, making them useful for
on-device, privacy-sensitive, and edge computing applications. On the other
hand, membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a
given sample was used in a model's training, are an important threat with
serious privacy and intellectual property implications. In this paper, we study
MIAs on SLMs. Although MIAs were shown to be effective on large language models
(LLMs), they are relatively less studied on emerging SLMs, and furthermore,
their effectiveness decreases as models get smaller. Motivated by this finding,
we propose a new MIA called win-k, which builds on top of a state-of-the-art
attack (min-k). We experimentally evaluate win-k by comparing it with five
existing MIAs using three datasets and eight SLMs. Results show that win-k
outperforms existing MIAs in terms of AUROC, TPR @ 1% FPR, and FPR @ 99% TPR
metrics, especially on smaller models.

*Xianda Zheng,Zijian Huang,Meng-Fen Chiang,Michael J. Witbrock,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR) framework to help LLMs resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts by rewarding logical consistency in reasoning paths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The prevalence of knowledge conflicts in LLMs due to lengthy and conflicting contexts necessitates a solution to enhance their reasoning capabilities.

Method: KCR extracts reasoning paths (text or knowledge graphs) from conflicting contexts and uses Reinforcement Learning to train models to follow correct reasoning paths.

Result: Experiments show KCR significantly improves LLMs' ability to resolve knowledge conflicts in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: KCR effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning and conflict resolution capabilities, providing substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Knowledge conflicts commonly arise across diverse sources, and their
prevalence has increased with the advent of LLMs. When dealing with conflicts
between multiple contexts, also known as \emph{inter-context knowledge
conflicts}, LLMs are often confused by lengthy and conflicting contexts. To
address this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)
framework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.
The key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning
process by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with
stronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.
Specifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or
local knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts. Subsequently, we
employ Reinforcement Learning to encourage the model to learn the paradigm of
reasoning process that follows correct reasoning paths rather than the
incorrect counterparts. This enables the backbone models to genuinely acquire
the capability to resolve inter-context knowledge conflicts within long
contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves the ability of various backbone models to resolve knowledge conflicts
in long-context scenarios, yielding substantial performance gains.

### [252] [Multi-TW: Benchmarking Multimodal Models on Traditional Chinese Question Answering in Taiwan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01274)
*Jui-Ming Yao,Bing-Cheng Xie,Sheng-Wei Peng,Hao-Yuan Chen,He-Rong Zheng,Bing-Jia Tan,Peter Shaojui Wang,Shun-Feng Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-TW is the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating any-to-any multimodal models, focusing on performance and latency. It includes 900 questions and reveals closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones, though open-source models excel in audio tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese and ignore inference latency, prompting the creation of Multi-TW.

Method: Multi-TW uses 900 multiple-choice questions (image-text, audio-text pairs) from official proficiency tests. It evaluates any-to-any models and VLMs with audio transcription.

Result: Closed-source models outperform open-source ones across modalities, but open-source models perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end pipelines have lower latency than VLMs with separate transcription.

Conclusion: Multi-TW highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and efficient multimodal architectures, providing a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

*Yujing Ke,Kevin George,Kathan Pandya,David Blumenthal,Maximilian Sprang,Gerrit Großmann,Sebastian Vollmer,David Antony Selby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BioDisco is a multi-agent framework for generating novel, evidence-grounded hypotheses using language models and dual-mode evidence systems, validated by temporal and human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of generating novel hypotheses amidst overwhelming information complexity and limitations of existing automated methods.

Method: Combines language model-based reasoning, biomedical knowledge graphs, automated literature retrieval, and iterative refinement with internal scoring and feedback loops.

Result: Demonstrates superior novelty and significance over existing methods, validated by temporal and human evaluations.

Conclusion: BioDisco is a flexible, modular tool for hypothesis discovery, easily integrable and practical for researchers.

Abstract: Identifying novel hypotheses is essential to scientific research, yet this
process risks being overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of available
information. Existing automated methods often struggle to generate novel and
evidence-grounded hypotheses, lack robust iterative refinement and rarely
undergo rigorous temporal evaluation for future discovery potential. To address
this, we propose BioDisco, a multi-agent framework that draws upon language
model-based reasoning and a dual-mode evidence system (biomedical knowledge
graphs and automated literature retrieval) for grounded novelty, integrates an
internal scoring and feedback loop for iterative refinement, and validates
performance through pioneering temporal and human evaluations and a
Bradley-Terry paired comparison model to provide statistically-grounded
assessment. Our evaluations demonstrate superior novelty and significance over
ablated configurations representative of existing agentic architectures.
Designed for flexibility and modularity, BioDisco allows seamless integration
of custom language models or knowledge graphs, and can be run with just a few
lines of code. We anticipate researchers using this practical tool as a
catalyst for the discovery of new hypotheses.

### [254] [How Far Are LLMs from Symbolic Planners? An NLP-Based Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01300)
*Ma'ayan Armony,Albert Meroño-Peñuela,Gerard Canal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' planning abilities, proposing an NLP-based recovery pipeline to improve plan quality, but finds LLMs still unreliable compared to classical planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unreliability of LLM-generated plans, which often contain errors, by integrating NLP techniques for evaluation and recovery.

Method: A recovery pipeline with NLP-based evaluation and three stages of NLP manipulation to refine LLM-generated plans, followed by symbolic planning.

Result: The pipeline improves plan quality slightly (success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%), but LLMs still lack reliable reasoning, with only 2.65 executable actions on average.

Conclusion: LLMs remain unreliable for planning; the proposed NLP-based pipeline offers limited improvement, highlighting the gap between LLMs and classical planners.

Abstract: The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
been a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take
unstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI
planning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as
planners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated
actions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with
LLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various
planning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In
this paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing
(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery
pipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along
with three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the
LLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.
This pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context
of AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid
plans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during
plan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the
plans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and
reliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of
the plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated
plans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and
increases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.

### [255] [PUZZLED: Jailbreaking LLMs through Word-Based Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01306)
*Yelim Ahn,Jaejin Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PUZZLED is a novel jailbreak method for LLMs using word puzzles to bypass safety measures, achieving high success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring LLM safety is critical; existing jailbreak methods rely on iterative prompts or semantic transformations, prompting the need for a more effective approach.

Method: PUZZLED masks harmful instruction keywords as word puzzles (word search, anagram, crossword) for LLMs to solve, leveraging their reasoning capabilities.

Result: Achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 88.8%, with 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7 Sonnet.

Conclusion: PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful jailbreak strategy, exploiting LLMs' reasoning to bypass safety measures effectively.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
domains, ensuring their safety has become a critical concern. In response,
studies on jailbreak attacks have been actively growing. Existing approaches
typically rely on iterative prompt engineering or semantic transformations of
harmful instructions to evade detection. In this work, we introduce PUZZLED, a
novel jailbreak method that leverages the LLM's reasoning capabilities. It
masks keywords in a harmful instruction and presents them as word puzzles for
the LLM to solve. We design three puzzle types-word search, anagram, and
crossword-that are familiar to humans but cognitively demanding for LLMs. The
model must solve the puzzle to uncover the masked words and then proceed to
generate responses to the reconstructed harmful instruction. We evaluate
PUZZLED on five state-of-the-art LLMs and observe a high average attack success
rate (ASR) of 88.8%, specifically 96.5% on GPT-4.1 and 92.3% on Claude 3.7
Sonnet. PUZZLED is a simple yet powerful attack that transforms familiar
puzzles into an effective jailbreak strategy by harnessing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities.

### [256] [Idempotent Equilibrium Analysis of Hybrid Workflow Allocation: A Mathematical Schema for Future Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01323)
*Faruk Alpay,Bugra Kilictas,Taylan Alpay,Hamdi Alakkad*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes task delegation between humans and AI, proving stable equilibria where tasks are assigned based on comparative advantage. Automation's long-run share is derived, with simulations projecting 65% automation by 2045, leaving humans to specialize in supervisory roles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI reshapes work division between humans and machines, formalizing the process and identifying stable equilibria.

Method: Uses lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools to prove equilibrium existence and uniqueness. Analyzes a continuous model and three dynamical benchmarks (discrete linear, evolutionary replicator, Beta-distributed task spectrum).

Result: Automation projected to rise from 10% to 65% by 2045, with humans specializing in workflow conduction. Closed-form solution for automation share: $x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$.

Conclusion: Policies promoting human-AI teaming ('centaur' models) can optimize welfare by steering toward stable equilibria.

Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided
between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated
task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded
assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which
every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring
comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski
and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii)
derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised
continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* =
\alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and
$\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full
automation is precluded whenever $\beta > 0$. We embed this analytic result in
three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an
evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task
spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is
reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation
calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from
approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third
of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow
conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI
modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for
skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies
which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the
welfare-maximising fixed point.

*Ke Miao,Yuke Hu,Xiaochen Li,Wenjie Bao,Zhihao Liu,Zhan Qin,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DCUE, a new metric for evaluating unlearning in LLMs, addressing practicality, exactness, and robustness issues in existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unlearning evaluation metrics lack practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM scenarios.

Method: Proposes DCUE, which identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in confidence scores using a validation set, evaluated via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Result: DCUE outperforms existing metrics, addressing their limitations and guiding future unlearning algorithm design.

Conclusion: DCUE is a practical and reliable metric for evaluating unlearning in LLMs, with potential to improve future algorithm designs.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the limitations of existing unlearning evaluation metrics
in terms of practicality, exactness, and robustness in real-world LLM
unlearning scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new metric
called Distribution Correction-based Unlearning Evaluation (DCUE). It
identifies core tokens and corrects distributional biases in their confidence
scores using a validation set. The evaluation results are quantified using the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Experimental results demonstrate that DCUE overcomes
the limitations of existing metrics, which also guides the design of more
practical and reliable unlearning algorithms in the future.

*Zihan Zheng,Tianle Cui,Chuwen Xie,Jiahui Zhang,Jiahui Pan,Lewei He,Qianglong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces \Benchmark, a novel evaluation benchmark for LLM-driven GUI agents, and \Agent, a hierarchical architecture for long-horizon tasks. It highlights limitations in current benchmarks and models, demonstrating improvements via Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-driven GUI agents lack accuracy, reproducibility, and scalability, hindering progress in the field.

Method: The authors designed \Benchmark using Causal Pathways for verifiable atomic steps and developed \Agent for long-horizon tasks. They generated a human-verified dataset and applied RFT to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.

Result: \Benchmark proved challenging for top LLMs (e.g., Claude-sonnet-4 achieved 34.6% WPSR). RFT improved smaller models but revealed limitations in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The study provides a rigorous evaluation standard and dataset to advance GUI agent development, highlighting the capability ceiling of smaller models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Graphical User
Interface (GUI) agents is significantly hampered by the profound limitations of
existing evaluation benchmarks in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and
scalability. To address this critical gap, we introduce \Benchmark, a novel
benchmark engineered on the principle of Causal Pathways. This design paradigm
structures complex tasks into a series of programmatically verifiable atomic
steps, ensuring a rigorous, fully automated, and reproducible standard for
assessment. Concurrently, to mitigate the inherent capability deficits of
agents, we developed \Agent, a hierarchical agent architecture specifically
optimized for long-horizon tasks. We leveraged this agent to generate a
high-quality, human-verified trajectory dataset that uniquely captures diverse
and even self-correcting interaction patterns of LLMs. We then utilized this
dataset to perform Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model.
Our experiments reveal that \Benchmark~presents a formidable challenge to
current state-of-the-art LLMs; even the top-performing Claude-sonnet-4 achieved
a Weighted Pathway Success Rate (WPSR) of only 34.6\%. Moreover, while RFT
substantially improved the smaller model's GUI execution capabilities (WPSR
increased from 3.3\% to 10.8\%), its performance degraded sharply when handling
complex scenarios. This outcome highlights the inherent capability ceiling of
smaller models when faced with comprehensive tasks that integrate perception,
decision-making, and execution. This research contributes a rigorous evaluation
standard and a high-quality dataset to the community, aiming to guide the
future development of GUI agents.

*Zhehong Ren,Tianluo Zhang,Yiheng Lu,Yushen Liang,Promethee Spathis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A road-node-centric framework for next-step location prediction outperforms baselines by capturing urban road network constraints and exploratory behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Closed-world approaches fail to model exploratory behavior and urban road network constraints, limiting next-step location prediction accuracy.

Method: Uses a road-intersection graph, sector-wise directional POI aggregation, and a Relation-Aware LNN-Transformer for sequence modeling.

Result: Outperforms six baselines by up to 17% in accuracy and 10% in MRR, with high resilience to noise.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures urban mobility patterns, offering robust and accurate next-step predictions.

Abstract: Next-step location prediction plays a pivotal role in modeling human
mobility, underpinning applications from personalized navigation to strategic
urban planning. However, approaches that assume a closed world - restricting
choices to a predefined set of points of interest (POIs) - often fail to
capture exploratory or target-agnostic behavior and the topological constraints
of urban road networks. Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that
represents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,
thereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step
forecasting beyond fixed POI sets. To encode environmental context, we
introduce a sector-wise directional POI aggregation that produces compact
features capturing distance, bearing, density and presence cues. By combining
these cues with structural graph embeddings, we obtain semantically grounded
node representations. For sequence modeling, we integrate a Relation-Aware
LNN-Transformer - a hybrid of a Continuous-time Forgetting Cell CfC-LNN and a
bearing-biased self-attention module - to capture both fine-grained temporal
dynamics and long-range spatial dependencies. Evaluated on city-scale road-user
trajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17
percentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and
maintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in
accuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in
accuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TripTailor is a benchmark for evaluating personalized travel planning by LLMs, using real-world data to address gaps in current benchmarks and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLM-generated travel itineraries rely on unrealistic data and lack comprehensive evaluation metrics, failing to assess real-world quality.

Method: Introduces TripTailor, a dataset with 500,000+ POIs and 4,000 itineraries, to evaluate LLM performance in travel planning.

Result: Fewer than 10% of LLM-generated itineraries match human-level performance, highlighting challenges in feasibility, rationality, and personalization.

Conclusion: TripTailor aims to improve travel planning agents by providing a realistic evaluation framework, encouraging better understanding of user needs.

Abstract: The continuous evolution and enhanced reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have elevated their role in complex tasks, notably in
travel planning, where demand for personalized, high-quality itineraries is
rising. However, current benchmarks often rely on unrealistic simulated data,
failing to reflect the differences between LLM-generated and real-world
itineraries. Existing evaluation metrics, which primarily emphasize
constraints, fall short of providing a comprehensive assessment of the overall
quality of travel plans. To address these limitations, we introduce TripTailor,
a benchmark designed specifically for personalized travel planning in
real-world scenarios. This dataset features an extensive collection of over
500,000 real-world points of interest (POIs) and nearly 4,000 diverse travel
itineraries, complete with detailed information, providing a more authentic
evaluation framework. Experiments show that fewer than 10\% of the itineraries
generated by the latest state-of-the-art LLMs achieve human-level performance.
Moreover, we identify several critical challenges in travel planning, including
the feasibility, rationality, and personalized customization of the proposed
solutions. We hope that TripTailor will drive the development of travel
planning agents capable of understanding and meeting user needs while
generating practical itineraries. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: The paper investigates the interplay between text and graph representations in NLP tasks, using a unified architecture with knowledge co-distillation to analyze their complementarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically understand how text and graph representations interact and influence hybrid models in relational reasoning tasks.

Method: A unified architecture with knowledge co-distillation (CoD) is used to analyze text-graph interplay across five relational reasoning tasks.

Result: Interpretable patterns of alignment and divergence between text and graph representations are uncovered, revealing when and why their integration is beneficial.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into the complementary roles of text and graph representations in NLP tasks, guiding future model designs.

Abstract: Relational reasoning lies at the core of many NLP tasks, drawing on
complementary signals from text and graphs. While prior research has
investigated how to leverage this dual complementarity, a detailed and
systematic understanding of text-graph interplay and its effect on hybrid
models remains underexplored. We take an analysis-driven approach to
investigate text-graph representation complementarity via a unified
architecture that supports knowledge co-distillation (CoD). We explore five
tasks involving relational reasoning that differ in how text and graph
structures encode the information needed to solve that task. By tracking how
these dual representations evolve during training, we uncover interpretable
patterns of alignment and divergence, and provide insights into when and why
their integration is beneficial.

*Arindam Khanda,Anurag Satpathy,Amit Jha,Sajal K. Das*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CARGO is a framework for optimizing EV-based delivery routes and charging, addressing challenges like limited battery capacity and charging point availability. It includes an exact MILP solution and a heuristic, outperforming baseline methods in cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve urban logistics sustainability by addressing EV delivery challenges, such as battery limitations and charging logistics, to ensure efficient and cost-effective operations.

Method: The method involves a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) exact solution and a heuristic for efficient route and charging optimization, tested against baselines like EDF and NDF.

Result: Results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in charging costs compared to EDF and NDF, respectively, while maintaining delivery completion rates.

Conclusion: CARGO effectively optimizes EV delivery routes and charging, offering significant cost savings and practical feasibility for sustainable urban logistics.

Abstract: With growing interest in sustainable logistics, electric vehicle (EV)-based
deliveries offer a promising alternative for urban distribution. However, EVs
face challenges due to their limited battery capacity, requiring careful
planning for recharging. This depends on factors such as the charging point
(CP) availability, cost, proximity, and vehicles' state of charge (SoC). We
propose CARGO, a framework addressing the EV-based delivery route planning
problem (EDRP), which jointly optimizes route planning and charging for
deliveries within time windows. After proving the problem's NP-hardness, we
propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP)-based exact solution and a
computationally efficient heuristic method. Using real-world datasets, we
evaluate our methods by comparing the heuristic to the MILP solution, and
benchmarking it against baseline strategies, Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and
Nearest Delivery First (NDF). The results show up to 39% and 22% reductions in
the charging cost over EDF and NDF, respectively, while completing comparable
deliveries.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces kTPG and WinkTPG to refine MAPF plans into kinodynamically feasible paths, improving efficiency and solution quality for large groups of agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MAPF algorithms use simplified models, making it hard for agents to follow plans directly. The goal is to bridge this gap by accounting for uncertainties and ensuring collision-free paths.

Method: Proposes kTPG for refining MAPF plans into feasible paths and WinkTPG, a window-based execution framework, to dynamically update plans during execution.

Result: WinkTPG handles up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality by up to 51.7% over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address the limitations of standard MAPF, offering scalable and efficient solutions for multi-agent path planning.

Abstract: Planning collision-free paths for a large group of agents is a challenging
problem with numerous real-world applications. While recent advances in
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) have shown promising progress, standard MAPF
algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, preventing agents from
directly following the generated MAPF plan. To bridge this gap, we propose
kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG), a multi-agent speed
optimization algorithm that efficiently refines a MAPF plan into a
kinodynamically feasible plan while accounting for uncertainties and preserving
collision-freeness. Building on kTPG, we propose Windowed kTPG (WinkTPG), a
MAPF execution framework that incrementally refines MAPF plans using a
window-based mechanism, dynamically incorporating agent information during
execution to reduce uncertainty. Experiments show that WinkTPG can generate
speed profiles for up to 1,000 agents in 1 second and improves solution quality
by up to 51.7% over existing MAPF execution methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Refine-n-Judge automates dataset quality improvement using a single LLM as both refiner and judge, eliminating the need for human feedback or reward models. It shows significant performance gains in fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback for improving dataset quality in LLMs is costly and unscalable. Refine-n-Judge aims to automate this process efficiently.

Method: Uses an LLM iteratively to refine responses and judge improvements, stopping when no further enhancements are preferred.

Result: Fine-tuned models on Refine-n-Judge datasets outperformed original datasets, with 74% preference and performance gains up to +19%.

Conclusion: Refine-n-Judge is a scalable, effective method for enhancing dataset quality and model performance without human intervention.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress through
preference-based fine-tuning, which critically depends on the quality of the
underlying training data. While human feedback is essential for improving data
quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce
Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as
both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing
iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate
refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every
iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human
annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response
and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer.
This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the
refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of
increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public
datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and
conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on
Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of
comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4.
Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval
2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench. Our results indicate that Refine-n-Judge produces
high-quality datasets and scalable model improvements.

*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Paul Kröger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show context-dependent cognitive biases like escalation of commitment, with minimal bias in individual decisions but high bias in multi-agent or pressured scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if and how LLMs inherit human cognitive biases, particularly escalation of commitment, in high-stakes decision-making roles.

Method: A two-stage investment task tested across four conditions: model as investor, model as advisor, multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario, with 6,500 trials.

Result: LLMs exhibit minimal bias in individual decisions but show high escalation rates in multi-agent (99.2%) and pressured (68.95%) contexts.

Conclusion: LLM bias is context-dependent, highlighting risks in multi-agent and unsupervised deployments where social or organizational pressures exist.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in autonomous
decision-making roles across high-stakes domains. However, since models are
trained on human-generated data, they may inherit cognitive biases that
systematically distort human judgment, including escalation of commitment,
where decision-makers continue investing in failing courses of action due to
prior investment. Understanding when LLMs exhibit such biases presents a unique
challenge. While these biases are well-documented in humans, it remains unclear
whether they manifest consistently in LLMs or require specific triggering
conditions. This paper investigates this question using a two-stage investment
task across four experimental conditions: model as investor, model as advisor,
multi-agent deliberation, and compound pressure scenario. Across N = 6,500
trials, we find that bias manifestation in LLMs is highly context-dependent. In
individual decision-making contexts (Studies 1-2, N = 4,000), LLMs demonstrate
strong rational cost-benefit logic with minimal escalation of commitment.
However, multi-agent deliberation reveals a striking hierarchy effect (Study 3,
N = 500): while asymmetrical hierarchies show moderate escalation rates
(46.2%), symmetrical peer-based decision-making produces near-universal
escalation (99.2%). Similarly, when subjected to compound organizational and
personal pressures (Study 4, N = 2,000), models exhibit high degrees of
escalation of commitment (68.95% average allocation to failing divisions).
These findings reveal that LLM bias manifestation depends critically on social
and organizational context rather than being inherent, with significant
implications for the deployment of multi-agent systems and unsupervised
operations where such conditions may emerge naturally.

TL;DR: This survey explores how Language Models (LMs) can enhance tabular data preparation, analyzing their role in data acquisition, integration, cleaning, and transformation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with complex table relationships and task adaptability, while LMs offer promising automation opportunities.

Method: Systematic analysis of LMs in four core data preparation phases, integrating them with other components for task-specific solutions.

Result: Highlights advancements and proposes prospective pipelines for leveraging LMs in tabular data preparation.

Conclusion: LMs have significant potential to improve tabular data preparation, but systematic exploration of their capabilities and integration methods is needed.

Abstract: Data preparation is a critical step in enhancing the usability of tabular
data and thus boosts downstream data-driven tasks. Traditional methods often
face challenges in capturing the intricate relationships within tables and
adapting to the tasks involved. Recent advances in Language Models (LMs),
especially in Large Language Models (LLMs), offer new opportunities to automate
and support tabular data preparation. However, why LMs suit tabular data
preparation (i.e., how their capabilities match task demands) and how to use
them effectively across phases still remain to be systematically explored. In
this survey, we systematically analyze the role of LMs in enhancing tabular
data preparation processes, focusing on four core phases: data acquisition,
integration, cleaning, and transformation. For each phase, we present an
integrated analysis of how LMs can be combined with other components for
different preparation tasks, highlight key advancements, and outline
prospective pipelines.

### [267] [One Subgoal at a Time: Zero-Shot Generalization to Arbitrary Linear Temporal Logic Requirements in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01561)
*Zijian Guo,İlker Işık,H. M. Sabbir Ahmad,Wenchao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GenZ-LTL enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications by decomposing tasks into reach-avoid subgoals and solving them sequentially.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in handling nested, long-horizon tasks and safety constraints in RL, and improving zero-shot generalization for LTL specifications.

Method: Leverages B"uchi automata to decompose LTL tasks into reach-avoid subgoals, solving them one at a time with safe RL formulations and observation reduction.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Conclusion: GenZ-LTL provides an effective approach for generalizing complex RL tasks with LTL specifications.

Abstract: Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear
temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements,
yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested
long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when
a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this
paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to
arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi
automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid
subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on
subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot
generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a
time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel
subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the
exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic
assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms
existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PCF uses LLMs and mathematical frameworks to dynamically adapt AI agents in complex environments through a multidimensional parameter space (SPARK). It demonstrates adaptability trends via simulations, showing diminishing returns at higher complexities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of static agent architectures by enabling real-time reconfiguration and adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: Leverages combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory to define a SPARK parameter space. Uses LLMs to parameterize spaces and Monte Carlo simulations (1.25M) for analysis.

Result: Revealed adaptability trends across complexity tiers, with diminishing returns at higher levels, highlighting scalability thresholds.

Conclusion: PCF enables optimized, scalable, and ethical AI agent designs for dynamic applications like customer service and healthcare.

Abstract: The Polymorphic Combinatorial Framework (PCF) leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) and mathematical frameworks to guide the meta-prompt enabled design of
solution spaces and adaptive AI agents for complex, dynamic environments.
Unlike static agent architectures, PCF enables real-time parameter
reconfiguration through mathematically-grounded combinatorial spaces, allowing
agents to adapt their core behavioral traits dynamically. Grounded in
combinatorial logic, topos theory, and rough fuzzy set theory, PCF defines a
multidimensional SPARK parameter space (Skills, Personalities, Approaches,
Resources, Knowledge) to capture agent behaviors. This paper demonstrates how
LLMs can parameterize complex spaces and estimate likely parameter
values/variabilities. Using PCF, we parameterized mock caf\'e domains (five
levels of complexity), estimated variables/variabilities, and conducted over
1.25 million Monte Carlo simulations. The results revealed trends in agent
adaptability and performance across the five complexity tiers, with diminishing
returns at higher complexity levels highlighting thresholds for scalable
designs. PCF enables the generation of optimized agent configurations for
specific scenarios while maintaining logical consistency. This framework
supports scalable, dynamic, explainable, and ethical AI applications in domains
like customer service, healthcare, robotics, and collaborative systems, paving
the way for adaptable and cooperative next-generation polymorphic agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QCBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' quantitative reasoning in chemistry, featuring 350 problems across 7 subfields and 3 difficulty tiers. It reveals performance gaps in LLMs as task complexity increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored ability of LLMs in rigorous, step-by-step quantitative reasoning in chemistry.

Method: Develop QCBench with 350 computational chemistry problems across 7 subfields and 3 difficulty tiers, focusing on stepwise numerical reasoning.

Result: Evaluations on 19 LLMs show performance degradation with increasing complexity, highlighting gaps in scientific computation accuracy.

Conclusion: QCBench identifies LLM limitations in quantitative chemistry and suggests future improvements like domain adaptive fine-tuning.

Abstract: Quantitative chemistry plays a fundamental role in chemistry research,
enabling precise predictions of molecular properties, reaction outcomes, and
material behaviors. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
chemistry-related tasks, their ability to perform rigorous, step-by-step
quantitative reasoning remains underexplored. To fill this blank, we propose
QCBench, a Quantitative Chemistry benchmark comprising 350 computational
chemistry problems across 7 chemistry subfields (analytical chemistry,
bio/organic chemistry, general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical
chemistry, polymer chemistry and quantum chemistry), categorized into three
hierarchical tiers-basic, intermediate, and expert-to systematically evaluate
the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Designed
to minimize shortcuts and emphasize stepwise numerical reasoning, each problem
focuses on pure calculations rooted in real-world chemical vertical fields.
QCBench enables fine-grained diagnosis of computational weaknesses, reveals
model-specific limitations across difficulty levels, and lays the groundwork
for future improvements such as domain adaptive fine-tuning or multi-modal
integration. Evaluations on 19 LLMs demonstrate a consistent performance
degradation with increasing task complexity, highlighting the current gap
between language fluency and scientific computation accuracy.

*Dong Li,Yichen Niu,Ying Ai,Xiang Zou,Biqing Qi,Jianxing Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T-GRAG enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating temporal dynamics in knowledge graphs, outperforming existing methods in temporal reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GraphRAG methods ignore temporal dynamics, causing issues like temporal ambiguity and redundancy. T-GRAG addresses this by modeling knowledge evolution over time.

Method: T-GRAG includes a Temporal Knowledge Graph Generator, Temporal Query Decomposition, Three-layer Interactive Retriever, Source Text Extractor, and LLM-based Generator.

Result: T-GRAG outperforms prior RAG and GraphRAG baselines in retrieval accuracy and response relevance under temporal constraints.

Conclusion: Modeling knowledge evolution is crucial for robust long-text question answering, as demonstrated by T-GRAG's superior performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in natural
language generation but remain limited in knowle-
  dge-intensive tasks due to outdated or incomplete internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external
retrieval, with GraphRAG further enhancing performance through structured
knowledge graphs and multi-hop reasoning. However, existing GraphRAG methods
largely ignore the temporal dynamics of knowledge, leading to issues such as
temporal ambiguity, time-insensitive retrieval, and semantic redundancy. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Temporal GraphRAG (T-GRAG), a dynamic,
temporally-aware RAG framework that models the evolution of knowledge over
time. T-GRAG consists of five key components: (1) a Temporal Knowledge Graph
Generator that creates time-stamped, evolving graph structures; (2) a Temporal
Query Decomposition mechanism that breaks complex temporal queries into
manageable sub-queries; (3) a Three-layer Interactive Retriever that
progressively filters and refines retrieval across temporal subgraphs; (4) a
Source Text Extractor to mitigate noise; and (5) a LLM-based Generator that
synthesizes contextually and temporally accurate responses. We also introduce
Time-LongQA, a novel benchmark dataset based on real-world corporate annual
reports, designed to test temporal reasoning across evolving knowledge.
Extensive experiments show that T-GRAG significantly outperforms prior RAG and
GraphRAG baselines in both retrieval accuracy and response relevance under
temporal constraints, highlighting the necessity of modeling knowledge
evolution for robust long-text question answering. Our code is publicly
available on the T-GRAG

*Yuhang Gu,Xingyu Hu,Yuyu Fan,Xulin Yan,Longhuan Xu,Peng peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SURE-Med is a framework addressing visual, distributional, and contextual uncertainties in medical report generation, improving reliability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome uncertainties (visual, label distribution, contextual) hindering clinical deployment of automated medical report generation.

Method: SURE-Med includes modules for view repair, token-sensitive learning, and contextual evidence filtering to mitigate uncertainties.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks, enhancing reliability.

Conclusion: SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for trustworthy medical report generation by reducing uncertainties holistically.

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

*Zhihao Shuai,Boyan Li,Siyu Yan,Yuyu Luo,Weikai Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the NL2VIS pipeline to improve transparency and user control in automated visualization generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2VIS methods lack transparency, preventing users from understanding design rationales or refining outputs.

Method: The authors design a CoT reasoning process for NL2VIS, create the nvBench-CoT dataset, and develop DeepVIS, an interactive interface for inspecting and adjusting reasoning steps.

Result: Benchmark evaluations, use cases, and a user study show the CoT framework enhances NL2VIS quality and provides insightful reasoning steps.

Conclusion: The CoT framework successfully bridges the gap in NL2VIS by improving transparency and user interaction.

Abstract: Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and
communicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity
with authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language
models show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into
visualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent
reasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales
and refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization
(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for
NL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with
structured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized
dataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural
language descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables
state-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop
DeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT
reasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,
and make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative
benchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate
that our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing
insightful reasoning steps to users.

*Shijie Cao,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReflecSched enhances LLMs for DFJSP by using strategic analysis and heuristic-driven simulations, outperforming baselines and heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of traditional dispatching rules and opaque deep learning methods in DFJSP, while mitigating pitfalls of direct LLM application.

Method: Proposes ReflecSched, a framework where LLMs analyze heuristic-driven simulations to generate "Strategic Experience" summaries for better decision-making.

Result: ReflecSched outperforms direct LLM baselines (71.35% Win Rate, 2.755% RPD reduction) and individual heuristics, matching the best heuristic per instance.

Conclusion: ReflecSched effectively mitigates LLM pitfalls and improves scheduling performance, demonstrating its potential for adaptive reasoning in DFJSP.

Abstract: Dynamic Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling (DFJSP) is an NP-hard problem challenged
by real-time event adaptation and complex machine routing. While traditional
dispatching rules are efficient but rigid, deep learning approaches are opaque
and require intricate feature engineering. Large Language Models (LLMs) promise
adaptive reasoning without this engineering overhead, yet we find their direct
application is suboptimal. Baseline LLMs suffer from three key pitfalls: the
long-context paradox, where crucial data is underutilized; an underutilization
of expert heuristics; and myopic decision-making. To address this, we propose
ReflecSched, a framework that empowers the LLM beyond a direct scheduler by
equipping it with a strategic analysis capability. ReflecSched tasks the LLM to
analyze heuristic-driven simulations across multiple planning horizons and
distill them into a concise, natural-language summary termed ``Strategic
Experience''. This summary is then integrated into the prompt of a final
decision-making module, guiding it to produce non-myopic actions. Experiments
show that ReflecSched not only statistically significantly outperforms direct
LLM baselines, securing a 71.35\% Win Rate and a 2.755\% Relative Percentage
Deviation reduction, but also surpasses the performance of all individual
heuristics evaluated, all while demonstrably mitigating the three identified
pitfalls. Additionally, ReflecSched performs on par with the best heuristic
tailored to each instance across all problem cases.

*Shiyang Duan,Yuan Tian,Qi Bing,Xiaowei Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces HypoAgents, a multi-agent framework combining Bayesian reasoning and information entropy for automated hypothesis generation, validation, and refinement, outperforming benchmarks in quality and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of generating novel, feasible, and valuable scientific hypotheses automatically, addressing gaps in existing methods like lack of systematic modeling and closed-loop feedback.

Method: A multi-agent framework (HypoAgents) integrating Bayesian reasoning and information entropy across three stages: hypothesis generation, evidence validation, and refinement. Uses diversity sampling, N-R-F scoring, RAG for evidence, and iterative optimization.

Result: After 12 iterations, hypotheses improved by 116.3 ELO score, surpassing benchmarks by 17.8, with uncertainty (Shannon entropy) decreasing by 0.92.

Conclusion: HypoAgents provides an interpretable, probabilistic framework for automated scientific discovery, enhancing hypothesis quality and reliability.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has made the automated
generation of scientific hypotheses that combine novelty, feasibility, and
research value a core challenge. Existing methods based on large language
models fail to systematically model the inherent in hypotheses or incorporate
the closed-loop feedback mechanisms crucial for refinement. This paper proposes
a multi-agent collaborative framework called HypoAgents, which for the first
time integrates Bayesian reasoning with an information entropy-driven search
mechanism across three stages-hypotheses generation, evidence validation, and
hypotheses Refinement-to construct an iterative closed-loop simulating
scientists' cognitive processes. Specifically, the framework first generates an
initial set of hypotheses through diversity sampling and establishes prior
beliefs based on a composite novelty-relevance-feasibility (N-R-F) score. It
then employs etrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather external literature
evidence, updating the posterior probabilities of hypotheses using Bayes'
theorem. Finally, it identifies high-uncertainty hypotheses using information
entropy $H = - \sum {{p_i}\log {p_i}}$ and actively refines them, guiding the
iterative optimization of the hypothesis set toward higher quality and
confidence. Experimental results on the ICLR 2025 conference real-world
research question dataset (100 research questions) show that after 12
optimization iterations, the average ELO score of generated hypotheses improves
by 116.3, surpassing the benchmark of real paper abstracts by 17.8, while the
framework's overall uncertainty, as measured by Shannon entropy, decreases
significantly by 0.92. This study presents an interpretable probabilistic
reasoning framework for automated scientific discovery, substantially improving
the quality and reliability of machine-generated research hypotheses.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a generic global constraint, Generalized Cumulative, and a time-table filtering algorithm for scheduling problems with conditional time intervals, addressing gaps in open-source solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source solvers lack support for modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative functions, and practical implementation details are undocumented.

Method: The authors implement a single, generic global constraint (Generalized Cumulative) and propose a novel time-table filtering algorithm for tasks on conditional time-intervals.

Result: The approach performs competitively with existing solvers, effectively models producer-consumer scheduling, and scales well to large problems.

Conclusion: The proposed method fills a gap in open-source solvers and offers a scalable, competitive solution for complex scheduling problems.

Abstract: Modeling scheduling problems with conditional time intervals and cumulative
functions has become a common approach when using modern commercial constraint
programming solvers. This paradigm enables the modeling of a wide range of
scheduling problems, including those involving producers and consumers.
However, it is unavailable in existing open-source solvers and practical
implementation details remain undocumented. In this work, we present an
implementation of this modeling approach using a single, generic global
constraint called the Generalized Cumulative. We also introduce a novel
time-table filtering algorithm designed to handle tasks defined on conditional
time-intervals. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach, combined
with the new filtering algorithm, performs competitively with existing solvers
enabling the modeling of producer and consumer scheduling problems and
effectively scales to large problems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a foundational structure for analyzing and comparing reasoning systems across domains, especially in cases of failure or adaptation.

Method: Model reasoning systems as structured tuples with phenomena, explanation space, inference maps, and principle base, while evaluating internal criteria like coherence and soundness.

Result: The framework accommodates diverse reasoning processes and identifies failure modes, supporting future theoretical and practical investigations.

Conclusion: The work provides a versatile foundation for studying reasoning systems under structural constraints without proposing specific solutions.

Abstract: This paper outlines a general formal framework for reasoning systems,
intended to support future analysis of inference architectures across domains.
We model reasoning systems as structured tuples comprising phenomena,
explanation space, inference and generation maps, and a principle base. The
formulation accommodates logical, algorithmic, and learning-based reasoning
processes within a unified structural schema, while remaining agnostic to any
specific reasoning algorithm or logic system. We survey basic internal
criteria--including coherence, soundness, and completeness-and catalog typical
failure modes such as contradiction, incompleteness, and non-convergence. The
framework also admits dynamic behaviors like iterative refinement and principle
evolution. The goal of this work is to establish a foundational structure for
representing and comparing reasoning systems, particularly in contexts where
internal failure, adaptation, or fragmentation may arise. No specific solution
architecture is proposed; instead, we aim to support future theoretical and
practical investigations into reasoning under structural constraint.

TL;DR: Proposes an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process reward data construction for PRMs, introduces two uncertainty-aware output aggregation methods, and demonstrates their effectiveness in improving mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for constructing high-quality process reward data for PRMs are labor-intensive or inefficient, limiting their scalability and effectiveness.

Method: An uncertainty-driven framework for automated PRM data construction, including generation and annotation, and two uncertainty-aware aggregation methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote.

Result: Experiments on ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the framework's effectiveness and efficiency, with the aggregation methods further improving reasoning abilities across PRMs.

Conclusion: The proposed framework and methods enhance PRM training and mathematical reasoning, with code and data made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

TL;DR: LiveMCPBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM agents in large-scale MCP environments, featuring 95 tasks, 70 servers, and 527 tools. It includes LiveMCPTool for deployment and LiveMCPEval for automated evaluation, achieving 81% human agreement. The best model (Claude-Sonnet-4) scored 78.95%, but performance varies widely.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCP benchmarks are limited to single-server settings, failing to evaluate agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios.

Method: Developed LiveMCPBench with 95 tasks, LiveMCPTool (70 servers, 527 tools), and LiveMCPEval (LLM-as-a-Judge framework). Introduced MCP Copilot Agent for dynamic planning and API interaction.

Result: Best model (Claude-Sonnet-4) achieved 78.95% success rate, but performance varied significantly across models. LiveMCPEval agreed with humans 81% of the time.

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench provides a unified framework for scalable, reproducible evaluation of LLM agents in realistic, tool-rich MCP environments.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be

Existing approaches that rely solely on metric data often suffer from high
false positive rates (FPR) due to data imbalance between normal and anomalous
events, leading to significant operational overhead for system reliance
engineers. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for integrating metrics with log data, enabling more accurate and
interpretable anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose CloudAnoAgent, the
first neuro-symbolic LLM-based agent for anomaly detection in cloud
environments. CloudAnoAgent jointly processes structured metrics and textual
log data in a unified pipeline, leveraging symbolic verification to validate
detection hypotheses and generate structured anomaly reports. To support
systematic evaluation, we introduce CloudAnoBench, the first benchmark that
provides LLM-generated paired metrics and log data with fine-grained anomaly
behavior annotations, filling a critical gap in existing datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that CloudAnoAgent improves anomaly classification accuracy
by 46.36% and 36.67% on average and reduces the FPR by 36.67% and 33.89% on
average over traditional baselines and LLM-only baseline, with a boost on
anomaly type detection accuracy by 12.8% compared to vanilla LLM prompting.
These results demonstrate the strengths of our approach in improving detection
accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing interpretability, thereby
supporting practical deployment in enterprise cloud environments.

### [281] [ProKG-Dial: Progressive Multi-Turn Dialogue Construction with Domain Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01869)
*Yuanyuan Liang,Xiaoman Wang,Tingyu Xie,Lei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProKG Dial is a framework for creating high-quality domain-specific dialogue datasets using knowledge graphs, improving dialogue quality and domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for building domain-specific dialogue datasets are resource-intensive or lack quality and coverage.

Method: ProKG Dial uses knowledge graphs, community detection, and incremental Q&A generation with filtering to create dialogues.

Result: The framework improves dialogue diversity, coherence, and coverage, and enhances LLM performance in domain-specific tasks.

Conclusion: ProKG Dial is effective for generating high-quality domain-specific dialogues and improving LLM performance.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks but often
lack domain specific precision in professional settings. Building a high
quality domain specific multi turn dialogue dataset is essential for developing
specialized conversational systems. However, existing methods such as manual
annotation, simulated human LLM interactions, and role based LLM dialogues are
resource intensive or suffer from limitations in dialogue quality and domain
coverage. To address these challenges, we introduce ProKG Dial, a progressive
framework for constructing knowledge intensive multi turn dialogue datasets
using domain specific knowledge graphs (KGs). ProKG Dial leverages the
structured nature of KGs to encode complex domain knowledge and relationships,
providing a solid foundation for generating meaningful and coherent dialogues.
Specifically, ProKG Dial begins by applying community detection to partition
the KG into semantically cohesive subgraphs. For each subgraph, the framework
incrementally generates a series of questions and answers centered around a
target entity, ensuring relevance and coverage. A rigorous filtering step is
employed to maintain high dialogue quality. We validate ProKG Dial on a medical
knowledge graph by evaluating the generated dialogues in terms of diversity,
semantic coherence, and entity coverage. Furthermore, we fine tune a base LLM
on the resulting dataset and benchmark it against several baselines. Both
automatic metrics and human evaluations demonstrate that ProKG Dial
substantially improves dialogue quality and domain specific performance,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical utility.

### [282] [Multi-turn Natural Language to Graph Query Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01871)
*Yuanyuan Liang,Lei Pan,Tingyu Xie,Yunshi Lan,Weining Qian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses the gap in multi-turn NL2GQL research by proposing an automated dataset construction method using LLMs and introducing the MTGQL dataset for financial market graphs. It also provides baseline methods for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NL2GQL methods focus on single-turn transformations, which are insufficient for multi-turn, dynamic, and context-dependent user interactions with graph databases. The lack of high-quality multi-turn datasets further limits progress.

Method: An automated method using Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct multi-turn NL2GQL datasets, applied to create the MTGQL dataset from a financial market graph database. Three baseline methods are proposed for evaluating multi-turn NL2GQL translation.

Result: The MTGQL dataset is developed and will be publicly released. Baseline methods are introduced to assess multi-turn NL2GQL effectiveness.

Conclusion: The work fills a critical gap in multi-turn NL2GQL research, providing a dataset and evaluation baselines to support future advancements in the field.

Abstract: In recent years, research on transforming natural language into graph query
language (NL2GQL) has been increasing. Most existing methods focus on
single-turn transformation from NL to GQL. In practical applications, user
interactions with graph databases are typically multi-turn, dynamic, and
context-dependent. While single-turn methods can handle straightforward
queries, more complex scenarios often require users to iteratively adjust their
queries, investigate the connections between entities, or request additional
details across multiple dialogue turns. Research focused on single-turn
conversion fails to effectively address multi-turn dialogues and complex
context dependencies. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality multi-turn
NL2GQL datasets further hinders the progress of this field. To address this
challenge, we propose an automated method for constructing multi-turn NL2GQL
datasets based on Large Language Models (LLMs) , and apply this method to
develop the MTGQL dataset, which is constructed from a financial market graph
database and will be publicly released for future research. Moreover, we
propose three types of baseline methods to assess the effectiveness of
multi-turn NL2GQL translation, thereby laying a solid foundation for future
research.

TL;DR: SNOW, a modular multi-agent system using LLMs, autonomously generates structured clinical features from EHR notes, matching manual clinician feature generation performance without expert input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting meaningful features from unstructured EHR notes is challenging, with current methods either labor-intensive or lacking interpretability.

Method: SNOW employs specialized agents for feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, powered by LLMs.

Result: SNOW matched manual CFG performance (AUC-ROC: 0.761 vs. 0.771) and outperformed baseline and RFG methods, while clinician-guided LLM also performed well (0.732).

Conclusion: Autonomous LLM systems like SNOW can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, enhancing clinical ML models while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes
that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from
these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive
manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational
feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance.
Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular
multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously
generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human
intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM
approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in
147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest
performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without
requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline
features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method
also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized
agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and
aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical
information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings
demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature
engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage
unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for
clinical deployment.

TL;DR: AMADEUS framework with ACTS, GS, and AE improves persona consistency in RAG-based role-playing agents by optimizing chunk length, hierarchical contexts, and attribute extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance persona consistency in role-playing agents, especially for out-of-knowledge questions, by leveraging adaptive context-aware methods.

Method: Uses Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter (ACTS) for optimal chunking, Guided Selection (GS) for retrieval, and Attribute Extractor (AE) for persona attributes. Evaluated on CharacterRAG dataset.

Result: Effectively models character knowledge and attributes like personality, demonstrating robust persona consistency.

Conclusion: AMADEUS framework successfully improves persona modeling in role-playing agents, validated by the CharacterRAG dataset.

Abstract: We propose AMADEUS, which is composed of Adaptive Context-aware Text Splitter
(ACTS), Guided Selection (GS), and Attribute Extractor (AE). ACTS finds an
optimal chunk length and hierarchical contexts for each character. AE
identifies a character's general attributes from the chunks retrieved by GS and
uses these attributes as a final context to maintain robust persona consistency
even when answering out of knowledge questions. To facilitate the development
and evaluation of RAG-based RPAs, we construct CharacterRAG, a role-playing
dataset that consists of persona documents for 15 distinct fictional characters
totaling 976K written characters, and 450 question and answer pairs. We find
that our framework effectively models not only the knowledge possessed by
characters, but also various attributes such as personality.

### [285] [TRACEALIGN -- Tracing the Drift: Attributing Alignment Failures to Training-Time Belief Sources in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02063)
*Amitava Das,Vinija Jain,Aman Chadha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TraceAlign is a framework to trace unsafe LLM completions back to training corpus root causes, using BCI for semantic inconsistency. It introduces interventions like TraceShield, Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, and Prov-Decode, reducing alignment drift by 85% while preserving utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address alignment drift in LLMs, where models produce unsafe completions despite fine-tuning, by identifying and mitigating root causes in training data.

Method: Introduces BCI for semantic inconsistency measurement, and three interventions: TraceShield (inference-time filter), Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss (fine-tuning objective), and Prov-Decode (provenance-aware decoding).

Result: Reduces alignment drift by up to 85% on ADB, with minimal utility loss (delta <0.2) and improved refusal quality.

Conclusion: TraceAlign offers a scalable, traceable toolkit for mitigating alignment failures, with open-source implementation for further development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned to align with human values often
exhibit alignment drift, producing unsafe or policy-violating completions when
exposed to adversarial prompts, decoding perturbations, or paraphrased
jailbreaks. While prior work has behaviorally characterized alignment failure,
little is known about the training-time belief sources underlying these
failures. We introduce TraceAlign, a unified framework for tracing unsafe
completions back to their root causes in the model's training corpus. Central
to our approach is the Belief Conflict Index (BCI), which quantifies semantic
inconsistency between generated spans and aligned policies, based on retrieved
training documents using suffix-array matching. We propose three complementary
interventions: (i) TraceShield, an inference-time safety filter that refuses
completions with high-BCI spans, (ii) Contrastive Belief Deconfliction Loss, a
contrastive fine-tuning objective penalizing high-BCI continuations during DPO,
and (iii) Prov-Decode, a provenance-aware decoding strategy that vetoes beam
expansions predicted to yield high-BCI spans. Together, these defenses reduce
alignment drift by up to 85% on our curated Alignment Drift Benchmark (ADB)
while preserving utility on standard tasks, with delta less than 0.2 and
improved refusal quality. We further derive a theoretical upper bound on drift
likelihood via suffix-array span statistics, linking memorization frequency and
length to adversarial reactivation risk. TraceAlign thus provides the first
scalable, traceable, and grounded toolkit for understanding and mitigating
alignment failures at source. To encourage further exploration and development,
we open-source our implementation at:

*Jiawei Li,Chengye Yang,Yaochen Zhang,Weilin Sun,Lei Meng,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement to improve accuracy and reduce training costs in construction safety automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with complex hazard features, high training costs, and poor generalization.

Method: Integrates external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt fine-tuning, with three modules: retrieval library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement.

Result: GLM-4V's recognition accuracy increased to 50%, a 35.49% boost.

Conclusion: The method enhances accuracy, context understanding, and stability, providing new support for hazard detection.

Abstract: The goal of construction site risk and hazard identification is to enhance
safety management through automation. Existing research based on large language
models falls into two categories: image-text matching for collaborative
reasoning, which struggles with complex hazard features, and instruction
fine-tuning or dialogue guidance using professional datasets, which suffers
from high training costs and poor generalization.To address this, we propose a
hazard identification method using similar case retrieval enhancement. By
integrating external knowledge and retrieved case contexts via prompt
fine-tuning, we mitigate misjudgments caused by limited domain knowledge and
weak feature associations. Our method includes three modules: retrieval
library, image similarity retrieval, and large model retrieval enhancement,
enabling efficient recognition without training. Experiments on real
construction data show significant improvements. For instance, GLM-4V's
recognition accuracy increased to 50\%, a 35.49\% boost. The method enhances
accuracy, context understanding, and stability, offering new theoretical and
technical support for hazard detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A game-theoretic RL framework (MAC-SPGG) incentivizes cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles, improving performance over single models and other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between computation costs and collective performance in multi-LLM collaboration.

Method: Introduces MAC-SPGG, a sequential public goods game framework, to streamline cooperation and eliminate free-riding.

Result: MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles outperform baselines and achieve comparable performance to large-scale models.

Conclusion: Structured, incentive-aligned cooperation in MAC-SPGG enables scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks
collaboratively poses a fundamental trade-off between the computation costs and
collective performance compared with individual model. We introduce a novel,
game-theoretically grounded reinforcement learning (RL) framework, the
Multi-Agent Cooperation Sequential Public Goods Game (MAC-SPGG), to
systematically incentivize cooperation in multi-LLM ensembles. In MAC-SPGG, LLM
agents move in sequence, observing predecessors' outputs and updating beliefs
to condition their own contributions. By redesigning the public-goods reward,
effortful contributions become the unique Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium
(SPNE), which eliminates free-riding under traditional SPGG or PGG. Its
sequential protocol replaces costly round-based information exchanges with a
streamlined decision flow, cutting communication overhead while retaining
strategic depth. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the SPNE under
realistic parameters, and empirically show that MAC-SPGG-trained ensembles
outperform single-agent baselines, chain-of-thought prompting, and other
cooperative methods, even achieving comparable performance to large-scale
models across reasoning, math, code generation, and NLP tasks. Our results
highlight the power of structured, incentive-aligned MAC-SPGG cooperation for
scalable and robust multi-agent language generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SE-Agent is a self-evolution framework for LLM-based agents that improves reasoning by revising, recombining, and refining past trajectories, achieving a 55% performance boost on SWE-bench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based agents lack efficient exploitation of interaction trajectories, leading to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes.

Method: SE-Agent uses revision, recombination, and refinement of past trajectories to expand search space and enhance reasoning.

Result: SE-Agent achieves a 55% relative improvement on SWE-bench, outperforming other open-source agents.

Conclusion: SE-Agent's self-evolution mechanism significantly enhances reasoning quality and performance in complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have recently shown impressive
capabilities in complex reasoning and tool use via multi-step interactions with
their environments. While these agents have the potential to tackle complicated
tasks, their problem-solving process, i.e., agents' interaction trajectory
leading to task completion, remains underexploited. These trajectories contain
rich feedback that can navigate agents toward the right directions for solving
problems correctly. Although prevailing approaches, such as Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS), can effectively balance exploration and exploitation, they
ignore the interdependence among various trajectories and lack the diversity of
search spaces, which leads to redundant reasoning and suboptimal outcomes. To
address these challenges, we propose SE-Agent, a Self-Evolution framework that
enables Agents to optimize their reasoning processes iteratively. Our approach
revisits and enhances former pilot trajectories through three key operations:
revision, recombination, and refinement. This evolutionary mechanism enables
two critical advantages: (1) it expands the search space beyond local optima by
intelligently exploring diverse solution paths guided by previous trajectories,
and (2) it leverages cross-trajectory inspiration to efficiently enhance
performance while mitigating the impact of suboptimal reasoning paths. Through
these mechanisms, SE-Agent achieves continuous self-evolution that
incrementally improves reasoning quality. We evaluate SE-Agent on SWE-bench
Verified to resolve real-world GitHub issues. Experimental results across five
strong LLMs show that integrating SE-Agent delivers up to 55% relative
improvement, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all open-source
agents on SWE-bench Verified. Our code and demonstration materials are publicly
available at https://github.com/wanghuacan/SE-Agent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: StackItUp enables non-experts to create stable 3D structures from 2D sketches using abstract relation graphs and compositional diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robot manipulation systems require precise 3D poses, limiting accessibility for non-experts. StackItUp aims to simplify this by using hand-drawn sketches.

Method: The system uses an abstract relation graph to interpret sketches, capturing geometric relations and stability patterns. It grounds these to 3D poses with diffusion models and iteratively predicts hidden supports.

Result: StackItUp produces stable, multilevel 3D structures from sketches, outperforming baselines in stability and visual resemblance.

Conclusion: StackItUp bridges the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D structures, making complex 3D modeling accessible to non-experts.

Abstract: Imagine a child sketching the Eiffel Tower and asking a robot to bring it to
life. Today's robot manipulation systems can't act on such sketches
directly-they require precise 3D block poses as goals, which in turn demand
structural analysis and expert tools like CAD. We present StackItUp, a system
that enables non-experts to specify complex 3D structures using only 2D
front-view hand-drawn sketches. StackItUp introduces an abstract relation graph
to bridge the gap between rough sketches and accurate 3D block arrangements,
capturing the symbolic geometric relations (e.g., left-of) and stability
patterns (e.g., two-pillar-bridge) while discarding noisy metric details from
sketches. It then grounds this graph to 3D poses using compositional diffusion
models and iteratively updates it by predicting hidden internal and rear
supports-critical for stability but absent from the sketch. Evaluated on
sketches of iconic landmarks and modern house designs, StackItUp consistently
produces stable, multilevel 3D structures and outperforms all baselines in both
stability and visual resemblance.

*Kanghua Mo,Li Hu,Yucheng Long,Zhihao Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces a vulnerability in LLM agents where adversaries can manipulate tool metadata to influence agent behavior, proposing the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA) to exploit this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and address a new attack surface in LLM agents where tool metadata manipulation can stealthily influence agent decisions without prompt injection or model access.

Method: Proposes AMA, a black-box in-context learning framework that optimizes tool metadata to make malicious tools more attractive to LLM agents.

Result: Demonstrates high attack success rates (81%-95%) and privacy leakage across scenarios, with minimal impact on primary tasks, even under defenses.

Conclusion: Metadata manipulation is a potent attack surface, necessitating execution-level security beyond prompt defenses.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in complex reasoning and decision-making by leveraging external tools. However,
this tool-centric paradigm introduces a previously underexplored attack
surface: adversaries can manipulate tool metadata -- such as names,
descriptions, and parameter schemas -- to influence agent behavior. We identify
this as a new and stealthy threat surface that allows malicious tools to be
preferentially selected by LLM agents, without requiring prompt injection or
access to model internals. To demonstrate and exploit this vulnerability, we
propose the Attractive Metadata Attack (AMA), a black-box in-context learning
framework that generates highly attractive but syntactically and semantically
valid tool metadata through iterative optimization. Our attack integrates
seamlessly into standard tool ecosystems and requires no modification to the
agent's execution framework. Extensive experiments across ten realistic,
simulated tool-use scenarios and a range of popular LLM agents demonstrate
consistently high attack success rates (81\%-95\%) and significant privacy
leakage, with negligible impact on primary task execution. Moreover, the attack
remains effective even under prompt-level defenses and structured
tool-selection protocols such as the Model Context Protocol, revealing systemic
vulnerabilities in current agent architectures. These findings reveal that
metadata manipulation constitutes a potent and stealthy attack surface,
highlighting the need for execution-level security mechanisms that go beyond
prompt-level defenses.

TL;DR: The paper discusses the rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), focusing on DeepSeek R1, and highlights the issue of overthinking in these models. It reviews efficient reasoning methods, categorizing them into single-model optimization and model collaboration, and maintains a GitHub repository for tracking progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the problem of overthinking in LRMs, which reduces reasoning efficiency and accuracy, by exploring efficient reasoning methods.

Method: The paper systematically reviews efficient reasoning methods, categorizing them into two directions: single-model optimization and model collaboration.

Result: The study identifies key approaches to improve reasoning efficiency in LRMs and maintains a public GitHub repository for ongoing research.

Conclusion: Efficient reasoning methods are crucial for optimizing LRMs, with single-model and collaborative approaches offering viable solutions to mitigate overthinking.

Abstract: Recently, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have gradually become a research
hotspot due to their outstanding performance in handling complex tasks. Among
them, DeepSeek R1 has garnered significant attention for its exceptional
performance and open-source nature, driving advancements in the research of
R1-style LRMs. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs), these models
enhance logical deduction and decision-making capabilities during reasoning by
incorporating mechanisms such as long chain-of-thought and self-reflection
through reinforcement learning. However, with the widespread application of
these models, the problem of overthinking has gradually emerged. Specifically,
when generating answers, these models often construct excessively long
reasoning chains with redundant or repetitive steps, which leads to reduced
reasoning efficiency and may affect the accuracy of the final answer. To this
end, various efficient reasoning methods have been proposed, aiming to reduce
the length of reasoning paths without compromising model performance and
reasoning capability. By reviewing the current research advancements in the
field of efficient reasoning methods systematically, we categorize existing
works into two main directions based on the lens of single-model optimization
versus model collaboration: (1) Efficient Reasoning with Single Model, which
focuses on improving the reasoning efficiency of individual models; and (2)
Efficient Reasoning with Model Collaboration, which explores optimizing
reasoning paths through collaboration among multiple models. Besides, we
maintain a public GitHub repository that tracks the latest progress in
efficient reasoning methods.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the need for a systematic approach to managing anomalies in LLM-based agent systems, proposing a framework called AgentOps for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and resolving issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing use of LLM-based agent systems faces instability and insecurity due to anomalies, yet research on their operations is lacking.

Method: The paper defines and categorizes anomalies in agent systems, then introduces the AgentOps framework with its four key stages.

Result: A clear framework (AgentOps) is established to tackle anomalies in agent systems, aiding future research and development.

Conclusion: The study fills a gap in agent system operations research, providing a foundation for addressing anomalies systematically.

Abstract: As the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to
advance, LLM-based agent systems offer advantages in flexibility and
interpretability over traditional systems, garnering increasing attention.
However, despite the widespread research interest and industrial application of
agent systems, these systems, like their traditional counterparts, frequently
encounter anomalies. These anomalies lead to instability and insecurity,
hindering their further development. Therefore, a comprehensive and systematic
approach to the operation and maintenance of agent systems is urgently needed.
Unfortunately, current research on the operations of agent systems is sparse.
To address this gap, we have undertaken a survey on agent system operations
with the aim of establishing a clear framework for the field, defining the
challenges, and facilitating further development. Specifically, this paper
begins by systematically defining anomalies within agent systems, categorizing
them into intra-agent anomalies and inter-agent anomalies. Next, we introduce a
novel and comprehensive operational framework for agent systems, dubbed Agent
System Operations (AgentOps). We provide detailed definitions and explanations
of its four key stages: monitoring, anomaly detection, root cause analysis, and
resolution.

*Jingze Shi,Yifan Wu,Bingheng Wu,Yiran Peng,Liangdong Wang,Guang Liu,Yuyu Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA) introduces a trainable sparse attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity while maintaining information fidelity, outperforming existing methods in efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of standard self-attention in large language models limits long-context modeling. Existing sparse attention methods suffer from static patterns or information loss.

Method: DMA uses content-aware and position-aware sparsity: dynamically generating masks from value representations and skipping unnecessary calculations.

Result: DMA outperforms multi-head attention and other sparse methods in perplexity, associative recall tasks, and needle-in-a-haystack evaluations.

Conclusion: DMA effectively balances computational efficiency and long-context modeling, demonstrating superior performance in large-scale experiments.

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework for procedural game narrative generation uses emotional arcs (Rise and Fall) as a structural backbone, enhancing engagement and coherence in interactive storytelling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To operationalize universal narrative structures (emotional arcs) in procedural game narrative generation, improving storytelling in games.

Method: Leverages narratological theories and empirical analyses to guide branching story graphs, with nodes populated by characters, items, and gameplay attributes. Uses LLMs and adaptive entity generation in an ARPG prototype.

Result: Player evaluations show enhanced engagement, narrative coherence, and emotional impact.

Conclusion: Emotionally structured procedural generation advances interactive storytelling in games.

Abstract: The emotional arc is a universal narrative structure underlying stories
across cultures and media -- an idea central to structuralist narratology,
often encapsulated in the phrase "all stories are one story." We present a
framework for procedural game narrative generation that incorporates emotional
arcs as a structural backbone for both story progression and gameplay dynamics.
Leveraging established narratological theories and large-scale empirical
analyses, we focus on two core emotional patterns -- Rise and Fall -- to guide
the generation of branching story graphs. Each story node is automatically
populated with characters, items, and gameplay-relevant attributes (e.g.,
health, attack), with difficulty adjusted according to the emotional
trajectory. Implemented in a prototype action role-playing game (ARPG), our
system demonstrates how emotional arcs can be operationalized using large

*Qingyu Ren,Qianyu He,Bowei Zhang,Jie Zeng,Jiaqing Liang,Yanghua Xiao,Weikang Zhou,Zeye Sun,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-supervised RL framework improves instruction-following in reasoning models without external supervision, maintaining reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between reasoning and instruction-following in models, avoiding reliance on costly external supervision.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised RL framework using internal signals of reasoning models.

Result: Significantly enhances instruction-following while preserving reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for improving instruction-following in reasoning models.

Abstract: Reasoning models excel in complex problem solving but exhibit a concerning
trade off between reasoning capabilities and instruction following abilities.
Existing approaches for improving instruction following rely on stronger
external models, creating methodological bottlenecks and practical limitations
including increased costs and accessibility constraints. We propose a
self-supervised RL framework that leverages reasoning models' own internal
signals to improve instruction following capabilities without external
supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves instruction following capabilities while maintaining reasoning
performance, offering a scalable and cost-effective approach to enhance
instruction following in reasoning models. The data and code are publicly

*Jialiang Hong,Taihang Zhen,Kai Chen,Jiaheng Liu,Wenpeng Zhu,Jing Huo,Yang Gao,Depeng Wang,Haitao Wan,Xi Yang,Boyan Wang,Fanyu Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper addresses overthinking in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by decomposing it into internal and external redundancy, proposing a dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework to mitigate both, improving efficiency and interpretability without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overthinking in LRMs leads to verbose reasoning traces, harming efficiency and interpretability. Prior work focuses on reducing response length without analyzing semantic structure.

Method: A dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework: sliding-window semantic analysis for internal redundancy and penalizing continuation beyond the first correct solution (FCS) for external redundancy.

Result: Significant compression of reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, effective generalization to out-of-domain tasks, and safe removal of external redundancy without performance degradation.

Conclusion: The method improves reasoning efficiency and enables semantic-aware control over reasoning length, leading to more concise and interpretable LRMs.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often produce excessively verbose reasoning
traces, a phenomenon known as overthinking, which hampers both efficiency and
interpretability. Prior works primarily address this issue by reducing response
length, without fully examining the underlying semantic structure of the
reasoning process. In this paper, we revisit overthinking by decomposing it
into two distinct forms: internal redundancy, which consists of
low-contribution reasoning steps within the first correct solution (FCS), and
external redundancy, which refers to unnecessary continuation after the FCS. To
mitigate both forms, we propose a dual-penalty reinforcement learning
framework. For internal redundancy, we adopt a sliding-window semantic analysis
to penalize low-gain reasoning steps that contribute little toward reaching the
correct answer. For external redundancy, we penalize its proportion beyond the
FCS to encourage earlier termination. Our method significantly compresses
reasoning traces with minimal accuracy loss, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-domain tasks such as question answering and code generation. Crucially,
we find that external redundancy can be safely removed without degrading
performance, whereas internal redundancy must be reduced more cautiously to
avoid impairing correctness. These findings suggest that our method not only
improves reasoning efficiency but also enables implicit, semantic-aware control
over Chain-of-Thought length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable
LRMs.

TL;DR: A brain-inspired tripartite architecture with specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and executive systems, enhanced by temporal dynamics, improves AI flexibility and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current artificial neural networks lack flexible, generalizable intelligence due to divergence from biological cognition, missing functional specialization and temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes a tripartite architecture with specialized systems and integrates temporal dynamics via multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic adaptation.

Result: Achieves 2.18% higher accuracy, 48.44% fewer computations, and better alignment with human confidence patterns.

Conclusion: The architecture lays a foundation for brain-like intelligence across domains, potentially narrowing the gap between artificial and biological cognition.

Abstract: Despite remarkable capabilities, artificial neural networks exhibit limited
flexible, generalizable intelligence. This limitation stems from their
fundamental divergence from biological cognition that overlooks both neural
regions' functional specialization and the temporal dynamics critical for
coordinating these specialized systems. We propose a tripartite brain-inspired
architecture comprising functionally specialized perceptual, auxiliary, and
executive systems. Moreover, the integration of temporal dynamics through the
simulation of multi-frequency neural oscillation and synaptic dynamic
adaptation mechanisms enhances the architecture, thereby enabling more flexible
and efficient artificial cognition. Initial evaluations demonstrate superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art temporal processing approaches, with
2.18\% accuracy improvements while reducing required computation iterations by
48.44\%, and achieving higher correlation with human confidence patterns.
Though currently demonstrated on visual processing tasks, this architecture
establishes a theoretical foundation for brain-like intelligence across
cognitive domains, potentially bridging the gap between artificial and
biological intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A message passing method for Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization on factor graphs is introduced, transforming combinatorial search into tractable variational inference. It outperforms KL-control agents in stochastic and partially observable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge active inference theory with practical implementations by reformulating EFE minimization as a variational problem, enabling efficient policy inference under uncertainty.

Method: Reformulate EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy minimization with epistemic priors, using message passing on factor graphs for tractable inference. Applied to factorized state-space models.

Result: Agents using this method outperform KL-control agents, showing robust planning and efficient exploration in stochastic gridworld and partially observable Minigrid tasks.

Conclusion: The approach validates the efficiency of epistemic priors in artificial agents, providing a practical implementation of active inference theory.

Abstract: We present a message passing approach to Expected Free Energy (EFE)
minimization on factor graphs, based on the theory introduced in
arXiv:2504.14898. By reformulating EFE minimization as Variational Free Energy
minimization with epistemic priors, we transform a combinatorial search problem
into a tractable inference problem solvable through standard variational
techniques. Applying our message passing method to factorized state-space
models enables efficient policy inference. We evaluate our method on
environments with epistemic uncertainty: a stochastic gridworld and a partially
observable Minigrid task. Agents using our approach consistently outperform
conventional KL-control agents on these tasks, showing more robust planning and
efficient exploration under uncertainty. In the stochastic gridworld
environment, EFE-minimizing agents avoid risky paths, while in the partially
observable minigrid setting, they conduct more systematic information-seeking.
This approach bridges active inference theory with practical implementations,
providing empirical evidence for the efficiency of epistemic priors in
artificial agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AirTrafficGen automates ATC scenario generation using LLMs, ensuring operational realism and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ATC scenario design is time-consuming and limits diversity, prompting the need for automation.

Method: Uses graph-based representation and LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3) with engineered prompting for fine-grained control.

Result: LLMs generate high-traffic, realistic scenarios and support iterative refinement via textual feedback.

Conclusion: AirTrafficGen offers a scalable solution for ATC training, highlighting LLMs' potential in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: The manual design of scenarios for Air Traffic Control (ATC) training is a
demanding and time-consuming bottleneck that limits the diversity of
simulations available to controllers. To address this, we introduce a novel,
end-to-end approach, AirTrafficGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to automate and control the generation of complex ATC scenarios. Our method
uses a purpose-built, graph-based representation to encode sector topology
(including airspace geometry, routes, and fixes) into a format LLMs can
process. Through rigorous benchmarking, we show that state-of-the-art models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI o3 can generate high-traffic scenarios whilst
maintaining operational realism. Our engineered prompting enables fine-grained
control over interaction presence, type, and location. Initial findings suggest
these models are also capable of iterative refinement, correcting flawed
scenarios based on simple textual feedback. This approach provides a scalable
alternative to manual scenario design, addressing the need for a greater volume
and variety of ATC training and validation simulations. More broadly, this work
showcases the potential of LLMs for complex planning in safety-critical
domains.

Motivation: To address congestion and urban mobility challenges by leveraging human-like reasoning and self-exploration in traffic signal control.

Method: Developed through reinforced LLMs with expert guidance in a simulated environment, featuring a 3B-parameter architecture and synchronous communication.

Result: Outperforms baselines, manages 55,000+ drivers daily, reduces queues by 5%, and halves operator workload.

Conclusion: Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art, enabling scalable and efficient traffic management.

Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is vital for mitigating congestion and
sustaining urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce Traffic-R1, a foundation
model with human-like reasoning for TSC systems. Our model is developed through
self-exploration and iteration of reinforced large language models (LLMs) with
expert guidance in a simulated traffic environment. Compared to traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) and recent LLM-based methods, Traffic-R1 offers
three significant advantages. First, Traffic-R1 delivers zero-shot
generalisation, transferring unchanged to new road networks and
out-of-distribution incidents by utilizing its internal traffic control
policies and human-like reasoning. Second, its 3B-parameter architecture is
lightweight enough for real-time inference on mobile-class chips, enabling
large-scale edge deployment. Third, Traffic-R1 provides an explainable TSC
process and facilitates multi-intersection communication through its
self-iteration and a new synchronous communication network. Extensive
benchmarks demonstrate that Traffic-R1 sets a new state of the art,
outperforming strong baselines and training-intensive RL controllers. In
practice, the model now manages signals for more than 55,000 drivers daily,
shortening average queues by over 5% and halving operator workload. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance variability and lack of understanding in how model architectures and data characteristics impact MAC tasks.

Method: Systematic benchmark evaluation of MLLMs across MAC datasets and a novel hybrid strategy integrating generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning.

Result: The hybrid approach significantly enhances MLLMs' performance in MAC tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed strategy offers a promising direction for future MAC research, with code made publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Affective Computing (MAC) aims to recognize and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from diverse modalities such as text,
video, and audio. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have significantly reshaped the landscape of MAC by offering a unified
framework for processing and aligning cross-modal information. However,
practical challenges remain, including performance variability across complex
MAC tasks and insufficient understanding of how architectural designs and data
characteristics impact affective analysis. To address these gaps, we conduct a
systematic benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs capable
of concurrently processing audio, visual, and textual modalities across
multiple established MAC datasets. Our evaluation not only compares the
performance of these MLLMs but also provides actionable insights into model
optimization by analyzing the influence of model architectures and dataset
properties. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid strategy that combines
generative knowledge prompting with supervised fine-tuning to enhance MLLMs'
affective computing capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that this
integrated approach significantly improves performance across various MAC
tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research and development in this
field. Our code is released on https://github.com/LuoMSen/MLLM-MAC.

Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for LLMs in PHM lack structural completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and granularity, hindering deeper integration.

Method: PHM-Bench introduces a triadic structure (fundamental capability, core task, lifecycle) with multi-level metrics for tasks like condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

Result: The framework enables multi-dimensional evaluation of general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs using curated and public datasets.

Conclusion: PHM-Bench provides a methodological foundation and benchmark for transitioning from general-purpose to PHM-specialized LLMs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence, large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in industrial domains, offering
new opportunities for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). These models
help address challenges such as high development costs, long deployment cycles,
and limited generalizability. However, despite the growing synergy between PHM
and LLMs, existing evaluation methodologies often fall short in structural
completeness, dimensional comprehensiveness, and evaluation granularity. This
hampers the in-depth integration of LLMs into the PHM domain. To address these
limitations, this study proposes PHM-Bench, a novel three-dimensional
evaluation framework for PHM-oriented large models. Grounded in the triadic
structure of fundamental capability, core task, and entire lifecycle, PHM-Bench
is tailored to the unique demands of PHM system engineering. It defines
multi-level evaluation metrics spanning knowledge comprehension, algorithmic
generation, and task optimization. These metrics align with typical PHM tasks,
including condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, RUL prediction, and
maintenance decision-making. Utilizing both curated case sets and publicly
available industrial datasets, our study enables multi-dimensional evaluation
of general-purpose and domain-specific models across diverse PHM tasks.
PHM-Bench establishes a methodological foundation for large-scale assessment of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based solvers are unreliable and slow due to iterative repair loops. OptiHive aims to address these limitations.

Method: OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse components (solvers, problem instances, validation tests) and filters errors. A statistical model infers true performance for uncertainty quantification.

Result: OptiHive increases the optimality rate from 5% to 92% on complex problems like the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem.

Conclusion: OptiHive provides a reliable, interpretable, and efficient alternative to traditional LLM-based solvers.

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces PI, a framework for Test-time Prompt Intervention, to address redundancy in LLM reasoning by dynamically guiding and regulating reasoning paths during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM reasoning models often produce redundant chains of thought due to reliance on outcome reward paradigms, lacking process reward data.

Method: PI uses a three-module approach (When, How, Which) to dynamically intervene in reasoning paths, integrating human expertise and cognitive principles.

Result: PI reduces redundancy and hallucination in reasoning, producing shorter, more reliable chains of thought across multiple models and datasets.

Conclusion: PI enhances controllability and interpretability in LLM reasoning, offering a scalable solution to improve reasoning efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve transparency and interpretability in AI-based PMA prediction for neonatal health assessment, addressing the black-box nature of deep learning models.

Method: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, using 2D cortical surface projection maps from MRI scans.

Result: The model achieves a 95% confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks prediction error and generates clinically interpretable explanations.

Conclusion: This work advances transparent and trustworthy AI in perinatal neuroscience by combining accuracy with interpretability.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan is crucial for
assessing neonatal development and health. While deep learning models have
achieved high accuracy in predicting PMA from brain MRI, they often function as
black boxes, offering limited transparency and interpretability in clinical
decision support. In this work, we address the dual challenge of accuracy and
interpretability by adapting a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to
perform both precise PMA prediction and clinically relevant explanation
generation. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy
using instruction tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) applied to the
Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. The model is trained on four 2D cortical surface
projection maps derived from neonatal MRI scans. By employing distinct prompts
for training and inference, our approach enables the MLLM to handle a
regression task during training and generate clinically relevant explanations
during inference. The fine-tuned model achieves a low prediction error with a
95 percent confidence interval of 0.78 to 1.52 weeks, while producing
interpretable outputs grounded in developmental features, marking a significant
step toward transparent and trustworthy AI systems in perinatal neuroscience.

*Lei Zan,Keli Zhang,Ruichu Cai,Lujia Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAMA is a two-stage causal framework enhancing LLMs for complex math reasoning by constructing and refining a Mathematical Causal Graph (MCG) and dynamically using it to guide reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning due to deep structural dependencies, necessitating a structured approach.

Method: CAMA constructs and refines an MCG using causal discovery and feedback, then dynamically extracts task-relevant subgraphs to guide LLM reasoning.

Result: CAMA significantly improves LLM performance on challenging math problems, with structured guidance and asymmetric causal relationships proving most effective.

Conclusion: CAMA successfully addresses LLMs' limitations in math reasoning by integrating explicit, reusable mathematical structure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet they still struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, a challenge fundamentally rooted in deep structural dependencies. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{CA}usal \textbf{MA}thematician
(\textbf{CAMA}), a two-stage causal framework that equips LLMs with explicit,
reusable mathematical structure. In the learning stage, CAMA first constructs
the \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{G}raph (\textbf{MCG}), a
high-level representation of solution strategies, by combining LLM priors with
causal discovery algorithms applied to a corpus of question-solution pairs. The
resulting MCG encodes essential knowledge points and their causal dependencies.
To better align the graph with downstream reasoning tasks, CAMA further refines
the MCG through iterative feedback derived from a selected subset of the
question-solution pairs. In the reasoning stage, given a new question, CAMA
dynamically extracts a task-relevant subgraph from the MCG, conditioned on both
the question content and the LLM's intermediate reasoning trace. This subgraph,
which encodes the most pertinent knowledge points and their causal
dependencies, is then injected back into the LLM to guide its reasoning
process. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that CAMA significantly
improves LLM performance on challenging mathematical problems. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that structured guidance consistently outperforms
unstructured alternatives, and that incorporating asymmetric causal
relationships yields greater improvements than using symmetric associations
alone.

TL;DR: HealthFlow is a self-evolving AI agent for healthcare that improves strategic planning through meta-level evolution, outperforming existing frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI agents in healthcare rely on static strategies, limiting their ability to improve strategic planning, which is crucial for complex tasks.

Method: HealthFlow uses a meta-level evolution mechanism to refine high-level problem-solving policies by learning from successes and failures.

Result: HealthFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent frameworks, as demonstrated by experiments.

Conclusion: This work advances AI in healthcare by enabling self-evolving agents, shifting focus from tool-users to smarter task-managers.

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Noosemia,' a cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon where users attribute intentionality and agency to AI systems, driven by linguistic performance and epistemic opacity. It proposes a framework linking LLM meaning holism to the 'LLM Contextual Cognitive Field,' distinguishing Noosemia from similar concepts like pareidolia and animism.

Motivation: To understand and formalize the phenomenon of users attributing human-like qualities (intentionality, agency) to AI systems, particularly generative AI, due to linguistic and cognitive factors.

Method: Proposes a multidisciplinary framework combining cognitive science, phenomenology, and AI theory, linking LLM meaning holism to the 'LLM Contextual Cognitive Field' to explain the emergence of Noosemia.

Result: Clarifies how LLMs construct meaning relationally, leading to perceived coherence and agency in human-AI interactions, and distinguishes Noosemia from related phenomena like pareidolia and animism.

Conclusion: Highlights the philosophical, epistemological, and social implications of Noosemia, introduces 'a-noosemia,' and suggests directions for future research.

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

### [311] [What Is Your AI Agent Buying? Evaluation, Implications and Emerging Questions for Agentic E-Commerce](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02630)
*Amine Allouah,Omar Besbes,Josué D Figueroa,Yash Kanoria,Akshit Kumar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores how AI agents shop in online marketplaces using a sandbox environment (ACES) with a VLM agent and programmable marketplace. Findings reveal model-specific shopping behaviors, seller strategies for AI optimization, and potential market concentration issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI agents behave as consumers in online marketplaces, addressing what they buy and why, and the implications for sellers, platforms, and regulators.

Method: Developed ACES, a sandbox with a VLM agent and mock marketplace, randomized product attributes (position, price, ratings, etc.), and analyzed causal effects on shopping behavior.

Result: AI agents exhibit strong but varied position biases, penalize sponsored tags, and reward endorsements. Seller-side AI tweaks can boost market share. Demand may concentrate on few products, raising competition concerns.

Conclusion: AI agents' shopping behaviors differ across models, influencing seller strategies and platform design. Regulatory questions arise as AI-mediated shopping grows.

Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on
behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking,
vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and
transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why?
We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent
with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first
conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by
randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and
platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually
shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top
row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption
of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward
endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally
human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios
where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a
seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI
buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated
shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across
models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products,
raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents
may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy,
platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.

*Enrique Valero-Leal,Pedro Larrañaga,Concha Bielza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method for actionable counterfactual explanations is developed, avoiding direct use of training data by leveraging density estimators and path planning, ensuring privacy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide counterfactual explanations without exposing sensitive data, focusing on fairness and interpretability in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Uses Bayesian networks for density estimation and path planning algorithms to find actionable counterfactuals, masking sensitive data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in generating simpler, more actionable counterfactuals on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., EPA data).

Conclusion: The method ensures equitable policy decisions by capturing variable interactions, addressing sociodemographic impacts like the housing crisis.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations study what should have changed in order to get an
alternative result, enabling end-users to understand machine learning
mechanisms with counterexamples. Actionability is defined as the ability to
transform the original case to be explained into a counterfactual one. We
develop a method for actionable counterfactual explanations that, unlike
predecessors, does not directly leverage training data. Rather, data is only
used to learn a density estimator, creating a search landscape in which to
apply path planning algorithms to solve the problem and masking the endogenous
data, which can be sensitive or private. We put special focus on estimating the
data density using Bayesian networks, demonstrating how their enhanced
interpretability is useful in high-stakes scenarios in which fairness is
raising concern. Using a synthetic benchmark comprised of 15 datasets, our
proposal finds more actionable and simpler counterfactuals than the current
state-of-the-art algorithms. We also test our algorithm with a real-world
Environmental Protection Agency dataset, facilitating a more efficient and
equitable study of policies to improve the quality of life in United States of
America counties. Our proposal captures the interaction of variables, ensuring
equity in decisions, as policies to improve certain domains of study (air,
water quality, etc.) can be detrimental in others. In particular, the
sociodemographic domain is often involved, where we find important variables
related to the ongoing housing crisis that can potentially have a severe
negative impact on communities.

*Guowei Zou,Weibing Li,Hejun Wu,Yukun Qian,Yuhang Wang,Haitao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D2PPO introduces dispersive loss to prevent diffusion representation collapse in diffusion policies, improving robotic manipulation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion policies suffer from representation collapse, impairing their ability to handle subtle variations in robotic tasks.

Method: D2PPO uses dispersive loss regularization to treat hidden representations as negative pairs, enhancing discriminative learning.

Result: D2PPO improves performance by 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after fine-tuning, achieving SOTA on RoboMimic benchmarks.

Conclusion: D2PPO effectively addresses representation collapse, excelling in complex tasks and real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at robotic manipulation by naturally modeling
multimodal action distributions in high-dimensional spaces. Nevertheless,
diffusion policies suffer from diffusion representation collapse: semantically
similar observations are mapped to indistinguishable features, ultimately
impairing their ability to handle subtle but critical variations required for
complex robotic manipulation. To address this problem, we propose D2PPO
(Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization with Dispersive Loss). D2PPO introduces
dispersive loss regularization that combats representation collapse by treating
all hidden representations within each batch as negative pairs. D2PPO compels
the network to learn discriminative representations of similar observations,
thereby enabling the policy to identify subtle yet crucial differences
necessary for precise manipulation. In evaluation, we find that early-layer
regularization benefits simple tasks, while late-layer regularization sharply
enhances performance on complex manipulation tasks. On RoboMimic benchmarks,
D2PPO achieves an average improvement of 22.7% in pre-training and 26.1% after
fine-tuning, setting new SOTA results. In comparison with SOTA, results of
real-world experiments on a Franka Emika Panda robot show the excitingly high
success rate of our method. The superiority of our method is especially evident
in complex tasks. Project page: https://guowei-zou.github.io/d2ppo/

### [314] [Rethinking Graph-Based Document Classification: Learning Data-Driven Structures Beyond Heuristic Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00864)
*Margarita Bugueño,Gerard de Melo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a data-driven method for learning graph structures in document classification, outperforming heuristic-based approaches with higher accuracy and F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based document representations rely on manual heuristics or domain-specific rules, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness.

Method: The approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, using a self-attention model to learn edges and a statistical filtering strategy to retain only strongly correlated sentences.

Result: Experiments on three datasets show the learned graphs outperform heuristic-based ones in accuracy and F1 score, with statistical filtering improving robustness.

Conclusion: Automatic graph generation is more effective than heuristic approaches, offering potential for broader NLP applications.

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional
heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a 3D paradigm (Decompose, Decouple, Detach) and FECT benchmark to evaluate factuality in LLM-generated claims for contact center conversations, addressing hallucination issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often hallucinate, which is problematic for enterprise applications like contact center analysis where factual accuracy is critical. Ground-truth labels for interpretive claims are lacking.

Method: Proposes a 3D paradigm for human annotation and LLM-judges' prompts, and introduces the FECT benchmark dataset for factuality evaluation.

Result: The 3D paradigm and FECT dataset enable better grounding of factuality labels. Findings show alignment of LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.

Conclusion: The approach improves automatic evaluation of factuality in AI-generated claims for contact center conversations, addressing hallucination challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

*Ernesto L. Estevanell-Valladares,Suilan Estevez-Velarde,Yoan Gutiérrez,Andrés Montoyo,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XAutoLM is a meta-learning-based AutoML framework for efficient fine-tuning of language models, outperforming zero-shot optimizers and reducing resource usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated frameworks lack efficiency in model selection and hyperparameter optimization for LM fine-tuning, leading to high computational costs and environmental impact.

Method: XAutoLM uses meta-learning to reuse past experiences, extracting meta-features to guide sampling toward effective configurations and avoid costly failures.

Result: XAutoLM outperforms zero-shot optimizers in five of six tasks, reduces evaluation time by 4.5x, lowers error ratios, and discovers more efficient pipelines.

Conclusion: XAutoLM enables resource-efficient LM fine-tuning, promoting Green AI in NLP, and is released to the community for broader adoption.

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions
in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This
is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

*Yiqun Chen,Erhan Zhang,Lingyong Yan,Shuaiqiang Wang,Jizhou Huang,Dawei Yin,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAO-ARAG is an adaptive RAG framework using multi-agent orchestration to dynamically tailor workflows for each query, balancing answer quality and cost efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed RAG pipelines struggle with varying query complexities, leading to inefficiencies in performance and cost.

Method: Proposes MAO-ARAG, a multi-turn framework with executor agents (query reformulation, document selection, generation) and a planner agent trained via reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves high answer quality while maintaining reasonable costs and latency across multiple QA datasets.

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG effectively addresses the limitations of fixed RAG pipelines by dynamically adapting to query needs.

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

*Farah Adeeba,Brian Dillon,Hassan Sajjad,Rajesh Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces UrBLiMP, a benchmark for evaluating multilingual LLMs' linguistic knowledge in Urdu, revealing performance variations and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess LLMs' syntactic understanding in low-resource languages like Urdu, which lack sufficient training data compared to high-resource languages.

Method: Created UrBLiMP, a dataset of 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten syntactic phenomena, validated with 96.10% inter-annotator agreement. Evaluated 20 multilingual LLMs.

Result: LLaMA-3-70B performed best (94.73%), but top models like Gemma-3-27B-PT were statistically comparable. Performance varied across linguistic phenomena.

Conclusion: Multilingual LLMs show potential but have limitations in fine-grained syntactic understanding for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need to convert unstructured internet data into structured formats for improved user experiences and content distribution at Pinterest.

Method: A novel webpage representation combining structural, visual, and text modalities, optimized for small model learning, using XGBoost for attribute extraction.

Result: Achieves high accuracy and scalability, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, and is 1000 times more cost-effective than GPT alternatives.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates that simpler models with optimized representations can outperform complex LLMs in accuracy, scalability, and cost-efficiency for structured data extraction.

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can generate structured clinical consultation templates but struggle with length and prioritization, especially in narrative-driven fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to create clinically coherent and concise consultation templates for electronic consultations.

Method: Assessed multiple frontier models using expert-crafted templates, employing a multi-agent pipeline with prompt optimization, semantic autograding, and prioritization analysis.

Result: Models achieved high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2%) but produced overly long templates and failed to prioritize key questions under length constraints, with performance varying by specialty.

Conclusion: LLMs can improve clinical information exchange but require better evaluation methods for prioritization under real-world constraints.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emotion recognition across languages, proposing fine-tuning a multilingual LLM with LoRA for each language as the most effective method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in detecting emotions across languages due to cultural nuances in expressions.

Method: Fine-tuning a pre-trained multilingual LLM with LoRA separately for each language.

Result: The proposed method is the most effective for emotion recognition in the shared task.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning with LoRA per language optimizes emotion recognition in multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the
varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The
\textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared
task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different
languages. The goal of the task is to implement an emotion recogniser that can
identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

*Yige Li,Peihai Jiang,Jun Sun,Peng Shu,Tianming Liu,Zhen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptive Content Restriction (AdaCoRe), a lightweight method to prevent LLMs from generating restricted terms without fine-tuning, using Suffix Optimization (SOP).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content restrictions for LLMs vary by user groups and time, making fine-tuning impractical. AdaCoRe addresses this with lightweight solutions.

Method: Proposes Suffix Optimization (SOP), which appends an optimized suffix to prompts to block restricted terms while maintaining output quality.

Result: SOP outperforms baselines by 6-17% in restriction rates across multiple LLMs and is effective on real-world platforms like POE.

Conclusion: AdaCoRe and SOP offer practical, efficient solutions for dynamic content restriction in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a task to segment LLM chat queries into components like requests, roles, and context, revealing differences from human-human interactions. It analyzes user behavior over time and the impact of model capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand user behavior in LLM chats by segmenting queries and analyzing patterns, especially how users adapt over time and with new models.

Method: Segment chat queries into request content, roles, context, and expressions. Analyze diachronic patterns and model impact on user behavior.

Result: User queries evolve from request-heavy to more exploratory, converging with experience. Model updates influence behavior at the community level.

Conclusion: Segmenting chat queries provides insights into user behavior, showing adaptation over time and model influence, highlighting differences from human interactions.

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

*Ethan Hsu,Hong Meng Yam,Ines Bouissou,Aaron Murali John,Raj Thota,Josh Koe,Vivek Sarath Putta,G K Dharesan,Alexander Spangher,Shikhar Murty,Tenghao Huang,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebDS is a new benchmark for web-based data science tasks, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by focusing on complex, multi-step operations with diverse tools and data formats. Current LLM agents struggle with these tasks, revealing new failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too simplistic or static, failing to reflect real-world data science workflows. WebDS aims to provide a more realistic and challenging evaluation framework.

Method: WebDS includes 870 tasks across 29 diverse websites, requiring multi-step operations, tool usage, and handling of heterogeneous data formats.

Result: Current LLM agents perform poorly on WebDS (15% success rate), with issues like poor information grounding, repetitive behavior, and shortcut-taking.

Conclusion: WebDS offers a robust benchmark for advancing LLM-based data science, highlighting areas for improvement in agent performance.

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

*Yue Chen,Minghua He,Fangkai Yang,Pu Zhao,Lu Wang,Yu Kang,Yifei Dong,Yuefeng Zhan,Hao Sun,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WarriorMath is a defect-aware framework for improving LLMs' mathematical problem-solving by generating targeted training data and using progressive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for augmenting training data overlook LLMs' failure modes, limiting performance gains.

Method: WarriorMath uses expert LLMs to generate, critique, and refine problems, then iteratively trains the model with progressively challenging data.

Result: WarriorMath outperforms baselines by 12.57% on average across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: The defect-aware, multi-expert framework effectively enhances LLMs' mathematical abilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the XAI Challenge 2025, a hackathon focused on building explainable AI QA systems for education, using lightweight LLMs or hybrid systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for transparency and interpretability in AI-driven education by leveraging hackathons for XAI solutions.

Method: Hackathon-style competition with participants developing QA systems using lightweight LLMs or hybrid symbolic systems, evaluated on a high-quality, logic-validated dataset.

Result: The challenge successfully bridged LLMs and symbolic reasoning for explainability, yielding insights for future XAI educational systems.

Conclusion: The XAI Challenge 2025 exemplifies a novel approach to integrating LLMs and symbolic reasoning for transparent AI in education, providing a model for future initiatives.

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

*Zhichao Yan,Jiapu Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Yanyan Wang,Hongye Tan,Jiye Liang,Xiaoli Li,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how partially relevant knowledge can 'awaken' LLMs in RAG systems, improving performance in incomplete knowledge scenarios, and introduces a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge in RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge bases, motivates the study.

Method: The authors use triplets from gold reasoning paths (with answer paths removed) to construct partially relevant knowledge and test the 'awakening' effect in LLMs. Theoretical analysis and experiments on KG QA datasets validate the approach.

Result: The proposed awakening-based approach outperforms traditional embedding-based methods, especially in noisy or incomplete knowledge scenarios.

Conclusion: Partially relevant knowledge can enhance LLM performance in RAG systems, offering a practical solution for real-world challenges like incomplete KG QA.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

TL;DR: KEDAS improves knowledge editing in LLMs via alignment, diverse augmentation, and self-adaptive inference, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently update outdated knowledge in LLMs while preserving their capabilities, addressing limitations of current parameter-level or retrieval-based methods.

Method: Uses low-rank adaptation for alignment, diverse edit augmentation for recall, and a self-adaptive inference mechanism with dynamic routing.

Result: Achieves top performance in 35/36 cases, surpassing baselines by 19.8 harmonic mean scores, with robust efficiency.

Conclusion: KEDAS is an effective and efficient paradigm for knowledge editing alignment in LLMs.

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality QA datasets are scarce and costly, limiting supervised fine-tuning for domain-specific LLMs.

Method: D-SCoRE combines document-centric processing, segmentation, CoT reasoning, and structured export to create QA-CoT datasets, with controls for diversity and relevance.

Result: D-SCoRE-generated datasets outperform human-annotated ones (e.g., SQuAD, Covid-QA) in evaluations, producing QA-CoT pairs efficiently (90 seconds per 100-200 words).

Conclusion: D-SCoRE offers a scalable, efficient solution for QA dataset generation, enhancing domain-specific LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

Motivation: Addresses the scarcity of high-quality, diverse training data for LLMs.

Method: Extracts KPs from QA seed data, constructs a KP graph, and uses knowledge distribution and diffusion-based synthesis to generate diverse QA data.

Result: LinkQA, a 50B-token dataset, improves Llama-3 8B performance by 11.51% on MMLU and CMMLU.

Conclusion: LinkSyn effectively enhances LLM training with diverse, high-quality data, achieving SOTA results.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

TL;DR: The paper introduces BoostQA, a 100B-token QA dataset, to address the scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data for LLMs. It improves model performance, especially in STEM and high-difficulty contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality, knowledge-diverse training data is scarce, limiting LLM development. Existing QA datasets lack scalability and diversity, particularly in cross-domain and high-difficulty scenarios.

Method: A diversified pipeline synthesizes BoostQA: (1) curating seed data, (2) using DeepSeek-R1 for STEM-focused and high-difficulty synthesis, (3) refining answers with DeepSeek-V3. Mid-training with BoostQA enhances domain-specific knowledge.

Result: Llama-3 8B mid-trained on BoostQA achieves a 12.74% average improvement on MMLU and CMMLU, setting SOTA on 12 benchmarks. Performance scales with model size, data volume, and FLOPs.

Conclusion: BoostQA effectively addresses data scarcity and diversity issues, significantly improving LLM performance, especially in STEM and high-difficulty tasks, with scalable benefits.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also
demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as
model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of existing bias evaluation methods in LLMs, which rely on predefined associations and miss subtle or new biases.

Method: BADF systematically extracts associations between demographic identities and concepts from open-ended LLM outputs, tested across multiple models and real-world contexts.

Result: BADF successfully maps diverse bias associations, revealing both known and unrecognized biases in LLMs.

Conclusion: BADF advances bias understanding in LLMs and offers a scalable tool for bias detection, with resources publicly available.

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

TL;DR: ORACLE is a training-free framework combining LLMs and knowledge graphs to improve multi-hop question answering by constructing dynamic ontologies and logical reasoning chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex multi-hop question answering due to inadequate capture of deep conceptual relationships.

Method: ORACLE uses three stages: dynamic ontology construction, transformation into First-Order Logic chains, and query decomposition into sub-questions.

Result: Competitive performance on MQA benchmarks, rivaling state-of-the-art models, with logical and interpretable reasoning chains.

Conclusion: ORACLE effectively enhances LLMs' reasoning for complex tasks, offering a structured and interpretable approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

TL;DR: DIQ, a data selection strategy, balances sample difficulty and gradient influence to improve medical reasoning in LLMs, outperforming baselines with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SFT practices use unfiltered datasets with redundant/low-quality samples, leading to inefficiency and poor performance. Gradient-based or difficulty-based methods alone are insufficient.

Method: Proposes DIQ, selecting high-difficulty-high-influence samples to balance reasoning complexity and optimization utility.

Result: DIQ achieves full-dataset performance with 1% data and outperforms baselines with 10%, improving clinical reasoning alignment.

Conclusion: DIQ demonstrates the superiority of principled data selection over brute-force scaling, enabling efficient and high-quality medical reasoning.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: A syntax-aware diffusion framework improves code generation by incorporating structural priors from ASTs, enhancing syntactic correctness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with structured domains like source code due to strict syntactic and semantic rules, which standard token-level corruption techniques often ignore.

Method: Proposes a syntax-aware diffusion framework that selectively corrupts syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST subtrees, preserving grammatical boundaries.

Result: Syntax-aware corruption improves syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen code patterns.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural information into diffusion models is promising for advancing code generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

large language models (LLMs) as retrieval-augmented generators to answer
biomedical questions. Various models are used to process the questions. A
majority voting system combines their output to determine the final answer for
Yes/No questions, while for list and factoid type questions, the union of their
answers in used. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open source LLMs, exploring
all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in
tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable
insight into which combinations of LLMs consistently produce superior results
for specific question types. In the four rounds of the 2025 BioASQ challenge,
our system achieved notable results: in the Synergy task, we secured 1st place
for ideal answers and 2nd place for exact answers in round 2, as well as two
shared 1st places for exact answers in round 3 and 4.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TeSent, a benchmark dataset for Telugu sentiment classification, addressing resource scarcity. It includes explainability and fairness evaluations, showing improved model accuracy and reduced bias when trained with human-annotated rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Telugu, a major Dravidian language, lacks high-quality annotated resources for NLP tasks. This work aims to fill this gap by creating a sentiment classification dataset with explainability and fairness evaluations.

Method: The authors scraped Telugu texts from various sources, preprocessed them into 26,150 sentences, and annotated them using a custom platform. They fine-tuned SOTA models with and without rationales, evaluated explainers, and curated TeEEC for fairness assessment.

Result: Training with rationales improved model accuracy, reduced bias, and aligned explainers' outputs with human reasoning.

Conclusion: TeSent and TeEEC provide valuable resources for Telugu NLP, demonstrating the benefits of incorporating human rationales for better model performance and fairness.

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

*Zhivar Sourati,Alireza S. Ziabari,Morteza Dehghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs risk standardizing language and reasoning, marginalizing diverse voices and cognitive strategies, which could flatten collective intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight how LLMs may homogenize cognitive diversity by reinforcing dominant styles and marginalizing alternative perspectives.

Method: Synthesizes evidence from linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to analyze LLMs' impact on language and reasoning diversity.

Result: LLMs reflect and amplify dominant patterns in training data, leading to cognitive homogenization.

Conclusion: Unchecked, LLM-driven homogenization threatens collective intelligence and adaptability by reducing cognitive diversity.

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems in education lack theoretical grounding, unlike earlier intelligent tutoring systems. This work aims to bridge that gap.

Method: Proposes a framework integrating Evidence-Centered Design and Social Cognitive Theory, implemented in Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent.

Result: Inquizzitor provides high-quality, theory-aligned assessment and interaction, valued by students and effective for teachers.

Conclusion: Theory-driven LLM integration in education shows promise for adaptive, principled instruction, as demonstrated by Inquizzitor.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities for creating
pedagogical agents that engage in meaningful dialogue to support student
learning. However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms
often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent
tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines
Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding
in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework
with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates
human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive
science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality
assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering
teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the
potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the
ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.

*Sara Câmara,Eduardo Luz,Valéria Carvalho,Ivan Meneghini,Gladston Moreira*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOPrompt is a multi-objective evolutionary framework optimizing prompts for LLMs, balancing accuracy and context size, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt design is complex and time-consuming; existing automated methods focus on single objectives, missing efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs.

Method: Uses Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) to map Pareto front of prompt solutions for accuracy and token size.

Result: Achieves same accuracy as baselines with 31% token reduction in Portuguese sentiment analysis.

Conclusion: MOPrompt effectively balances performance and efficiency, aiding real-world LLM deployment.

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

TL;DR: PromptAnatomy dissects prompts into components, selectively perturbing them with ComPerturb for robust adversarial attacks on LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods treat prompts monolithically, ignoring structural heterogeneity and differing vulnerabilities of components.

Method: Introduces PromptAnatomy, dissecting prompts into functional components and perturbing them with ComPerturb, incorporating PPL-based filtering for plausibility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates across datasets and LLMs, validated by ablation studies.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and

*Maziyar Panahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenMed NER introduces domain-adapted transformer models for biomedical NER, achieving state-of-the-art performance efficiently with lightweight pre-training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of extracting structured information from unstructured healthcare data efficiently while maintaining high performance across diverse entity types.

Method: Combines lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA backbones, followed by task-specific fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of 12 biomedical NER benchmarks, with significant improvements in specialized domains.

Conclusion: Strategically adapted open-source models can outperform closed-source solutions efficiently, with low computational and environmental costs.

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

*Lucio La Cava,Dominik Macko,Róbert Móro,Ivan Srba,Andrea Tagarelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multilingual Authorship Attribution (AA), addressing the challenge of identifying human or LLM-generated texts across diverse languages, highlighting limitations of monolingual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The difficulty in distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written content, especially in multilingual settings, motivates the need for fine-grained AA beyond binary classification.

Method: The study evaluates monolingual AA methods' suitability and cross-lingual transferability across 18 languages and 8 generators (7 LLMs and human-authored texts).

Result: Monolingual AA methods show adaptability but face significant limitations in cross-lingual transfer, especially across diverse language families.

Conclusion: The complexity of multilingual AA calls for more robust methods to address real-world challenges.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CUPID, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' ability to infer and apply dynamic user preferences from multi-turn interactions, revealing current models' limitations in contextual personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans have dynamic preferences that change with context, but current LLMs assume static preferences. The paper aims to address this gap by assessing LLMs' ability to infer and apply contextual preferences.

Method: The authors created CUPID, a benchmark with 756 human-curated interaction sessions, where users express preferences through multi-turn feedback. They evaluated 10 LLMs on their ability to infer and apply these preferences.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs performed poorly, with under 50% precision and 65% recall, struggling to infer preferences and discern relevant context.

Conclusion: The work underscores the need for advancements in LLMs for contextual personalization and proposes CUPID as a tool to drive such improvements.

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

### [348] [The Bidirectional Process Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01682)
*Lingyin Zhang,Jun Gao,Xiaoxue Ren,Ziqiang Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiPRM introduces a bidirectional evaluation paradigm for Process Reward Models (PRMs), improving reasoning quality by leveraging global context without added complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs use unidirectional (L2R) evaluation, limiting global context use and consistency verification. BiPRM addresses this by adding R2L evaluation.

Method: BiPRM incorporates a parallel R2L evaluation stream alongside L2R, using prompt modifications to reverse reasoning trajectories without extra parameters or latency.

Result: BiPRM outperforms unidirectional baselines by up to 31.9% in stepwise reward evaluation across multiple backbones and PRM objectives.

Conclusion: BiPRM is effective, robust, and broadly applicable, offering a promising direction for process-based reward modeling.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Collaborative Chain-of-Agents (CoCoA), a framework to improve synergy between parametric and retrieved knowledge in RAG, enhancing LLM performance in knowledge-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG methods struggle to fully exploit knowledge during generation, limiting synergy between internal and external knowledge.

Method: Proposes CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent RAG framework for conditional knowledge induction and reasoning, and CoCoA, a long-chain training strategy to fine-tune LLMs.

Result: CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances the integration and leverage of parametric and retrieved knowledge in LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

*Berkay Köprü,Mehrzad Mashal,Yigit Gurses,Akos Kadar,Maximilian Schmitt,Ditty Mathew,Felix Burkhardt,Florian Eyben,Björn W. Schuller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'expression leakage' in LLMs, where models generate sentimentally charged but semantically unrelated expressions. It provides a benchmark dataset, an evaluation pipeline, and shows that leakage reduces with model scale but requires specific mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the issue of LLMs generating sentimentally charged expressions unrelated to input context, termed 'expression leakage,' which prior work on semantic leakage did not cover.

Method: Collects a benchmark dataset, proposes an automatic evaluation pipeline, and experiments with model scaling and sentiment injection in prompts.

Result: Larger models reduce expression leakage within the same family, but mitigation requires specific model-building care. Negative sentiment in prompts causes higher leakage than positive.

Conclusion: Expression leakage is a distinct issue needing targeted mitigation strategies, not solvable by prompting alone, with implications for LLM development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

TL;DR: CultureGuard introduces a pipeline to create multilingual safety datasets, enabling training of a state-of-the-art safety guard model for LLMs in non-English languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of culturally aligned safety datasets for non-English languages in LLM applications.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: cultural data segregation, adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering to expand an English dataset into eight languages.

Result: Creation of a 386,661-sample multilingual dataset and a model achieving top performance on safety benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work bridges the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling culturally aware safety models.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

*Cheng Wang,ziru Liu,Pengcheng Tang,Mingyu Zhang,Quanyu Dai,Yue Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes IterChat, a framework for generating high-quality dialogue data to improve user preference extraction in dialogue systems, addressing challenges like annotation errors and inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for extracting user preferences in multi-turn dialogues face challenges like high annotation complexity and error propagation, leading to inefficiency and poor model performance.

Method: IterChat decomposes multi-turn preference extraction into iterative one-turn processes, using GPT4 to pre-define preference slots and generate diverse dialogue datasets with reduced annotation errors.

Result: Fine-tuning or few-shot prompting with IterChat's data format outperforms original multi-turn dialogues and improves annotator efficiency by 28.4%.

Conclusion: IterChat offers a scalable and efficient solution for generating high-quality dialogue data, enhancing preference extraction in dialogue systems.

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TDT introduces a novel AI-generated text detection method by analyzing temporal discrepancies, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated text detectors discard positional information, failing against localized adversarial perturbations due to non-stationarity in AI text.

Method: Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT) treats token-level discrepancies as a time-series signal, using Continuous Wavelet Transform to capture anomalies' location and scale.

Result: TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1% improvement over baselines) and 14.1% AUROC improvement on adversarial tasks, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Non-stationarity is key in AI-generated text; preserving temporal dynamics via TDT enables robust detection.

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

### [354] [A comprehensive taxonomy of hallucinations in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01781)
*Manuel Cossio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The report categorizes LLM hallucinations, defines their inevitability, explores types (intrinsic/extrinsic, factuality/faithfulness), details manifestations, analyzes causes, and suggests mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge of LLM hallucinations to improve reliability and responsible deployment in NLP applications.

Method: Provides a taxonomy, theoretical framework, and analysis of causes, manifestations, and mitigation strategies for LLM hallucinations.

Result: Identifies inevitability of hallucinations, categorizes types, and outlines detection and mitigation approaches.

Conclusion: Future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and human oversight for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

### [355] [HeQ: a Large and Diverse Hebrew Reading Comprehension Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01812)
*Amir DN Cohen,Hilla Merhav,Yoav Goldberg,Reut Tsarfaty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HeQ, a Hebrew Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, addressing the lack of semantic benchmarks in Hebrew NLP. It tackles challenges like annotation inconsistencies due to Hebrew's morphological richness and proposes new guidelines, protocols, and metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Hebrew NLP benchmarks focus on morpho-syntactic tasks, ignoring semantics. The authors aim to fill this gap with a Hebrew MRC dataset, highlighting challenges like morphological complexity.

Method: The authors create HeQ, a dataset with 30,147 question-answer pairs from Hebrew Wikipedia and tech news. They develop new annotation guidelines, crowdsourcing protocols, and evaluation metrics tailored for Hebrew's morphology.

Result: Standard metrics like F1 and EM are unsuitable for Hebrew MRC. The study shows low correlation between morpho-syntactic and semantic task performance, indicating specialized models are needed.

Conclusion: HeQ addresses Hebrew NLP's semantic gap and morphological challenges, paving the way for better NLU models for Hebrew and other morphologically rich languages.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Tan Chuan Fu,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato,Jonathan Z. Low,Eugene Ho Hong Zhuang,Daren Zong Loong Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgenticT$^2$S is a modular framework for KGQA that uses specialized agents and weak-to-strong alignment to improve accuracy and efficiency in cross-graph reasoning, particularly in low-resource domains like the circular economy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGQA methods struggle with generalizability and handling queries across multiple graphs, especially in domains like the circular economy where data is distributed and schemas are heterogeneous.

Method: AgenticT$^2$S decomposes KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents (retrieval, query generation, verification) and uses a scheduler for subgoal assignment. It includes a two-stage verifier for query validation.

Result: The framework improves execution accuracy by 17.3%, triple-level F$_1$ by 25.4%, and reduces prompt length by 46.4% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: AgenticT$^2$S demonstrates the effectiveness of agent-based, schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA, supporting robust cross-graph reasoning in sustainability domains.

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

*Rubin Wei,Jiaqi Cao,Jiarui Wang,Jushi Kai,Qipeng Guo,Bowen Zhou,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce hallucinations in LLMs by using a pretrained, differentiable external memory (MLP) to decouple memorization from the decoder, improving performance and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in decoder-only LLMs hinder their use in knowledge-intensive tasks. Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) lacks deep interaction with LLMs.

Method: Decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained MLP memory, trained to imitate retriever behavior on the pretraining dataset.

Result: Achieves 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web datasets, with faster inference and better performance on hallucination benchmarks and memory-intensive tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed architecture with external MLP memory outperforms decoder-only models and RAG, offering speed and performance benefits without overfitting.

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Web-CogKnowledge Framework and Web-CogReasoner agent, emphasizing knowledge acquisition (Factual, Conceptual, Procedural) and cognitive reasoning for web agents. It includes a dataset (Web-CogDataset) and benchmark (Web-CogBench) for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web agents need sufficient knowledge for cognitive reasoning, decomposed into knowledge content learning and cognitive processes.

Method: Proposes the Web-CogKnowledge Framework, Web-CogDataset, and a knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought reasoning framework for the Web-CogReasoner agent.

Result: Web-CogReasoner outperforms existing models, especially in generalizing to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: The framework and agent advance web agent capabilities through structured knowledge and reasoning, supported by open-sourced resources.

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

*Yijun Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Counterfactual Probing detects and mitigates hallucinations in LLM outputs by generating plausible but incorrect statements and evaluating model sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce fluent but factually incorrect outputs (hallucinations), necessitating methods to detect and mitigate such errors.

Method: Generates counterfactual statements with subtle errors, evaluates model sensitivity, and uses adaptive mitigation strategies.

Result: Superior detection performance on benchmarks like TruthfulQA, reducing hallucination scores by 24.5% on average.

Conclusion: Counterfactual probing is an effective, no-retraining-required solution for real-time hallucination detection and mitigation in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PunGPT2 is the first open-source Punjabi LLM suite, trained on a diverse 35GB corpus. It includes Pun-RAG for retrieval-augmented generation and Pun-Instruct for efficient instruction tuning. Quantum-RAG, a hybrid retrieval system, enhances contextual relevance with quantum-inspired methods. The models outperform multilingual baselines in perplexity, factuality, and fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages like Punjabi are often excluded from NLP advancements. This work aims to bridge this gap by developing tailored LLMs and retrieval systems for Punjabi.

Method: PunGPT2 is trained from scratch with a Punjabi-optimized tokenizer. Pun-RAG combines it with a dense retriever, while Pun-Instruct uses QLoRA for efficient tuning. Quantum-RAG integrates sparse and dense retrieval with quantum-inspired semantic matching.

Result: The models outperform multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in perplexity, factuality, and fluency. Quantum-RAG improves retrieval relevance with minimal memory overhead.

Conclusion: This work provides a scalable blueprint for LLMs in underrepresented languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

*Tom S. Juzek,Zina B. Ward*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study investigates why LLMs overuse certain terms like 'delve' and 'intricate,' linking it to Learning from Human Feedback (LHF). It proposes a method to detect LHF-induced lexical preferences and experimentally confirms LHF's role in word overuse, highlighting a misalignment between LHF workers and LLM users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reasons behind LLMs' lexical overuse of specific terms and explore the role of LHF in shaping these preferences.

Method: Uses Meta's Llama model to detect LHF-induced lexical preferences and experimentally emulates LHF to confirm word overuse.

Result: LHF contributes to lexical overuse, revealing a misalignment between LHF workers' preferences and LLM users' expectations.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for transparency in alignment research and contributes to explainable AI by clarifying LLMs' lexical biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

*Philip Schroeder,Ondrej Biza,Thomas Weng,Hongyin Luo,James Glass*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROVER is a framework for VLMs to recursively decompose long video trajectories into shorter subtasks, improving reasoning over video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with reasoning over long video sequences, limiting their use in embodied settings.

Method: ROVER recursively decomposes videos into subtask segments, using in-context learning for focused reasoning.

Result: ROVER outperforms baselines in task progress estimation, frame-level reasoning, and video QA, reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: ROVER improves video reasoning efficiency and accuracy, scaling linearly with video length.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes situated embedding models (SitEmb) to enhance retrieval performance by conditioning short chunks on broader context, outperforming larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where longer chunks strain embedding models and localized evidence is needed.

Method: Introduces SitEmb, a training paradigm for embedding models to encode situated context, and evaluates on a book-plot retrieval dataset.

Result: SitEmb models outperform state-of-the-art models, with SitEmb-v1.5 improving performance by over 10%.

Conclusion: SitEmb effectively enhances retrieval by leveraging situated context, demonstrating strong performance across languages and applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Abstract: To address the severe data scarcity in Tibetan, a low-resource language
spoken by over six million people, we introduce TIBSTC-CoT, the large-scale,

TL;DR: A scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce Product Question Answering (PQA) using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is proposed to address cognitive overload and improve personalized answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PQA systems struggle with leveraging user context and diverse product information, leading to cognitive overload for users.

Method: The framework integrates conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes using RAG to handle objective, subjective, and multi-intent queries.

Result: The system delivers personalized answers and identifies catalog gaps, with novel metrics introduced for RAG evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of current PQA systems by enhancing contextual understanding and scalability.

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify tweets by dementia caregivers for developing online support interventions.

Method: Binary classification using large language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods.

Result: Achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on validation and test sets.

Conclusion: The system effectively identifies caregiver tweets, aiding in online support development.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpeechRole-Data, a large dataset for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs), and SpeechRole-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating SRPAs. It highlights gaps in existing research and provides resources for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on role-playing agents focuses on text, ignoring speech in interactive scenarios. This paper addresses the lack of systematic evaluation for SRPAs.

Method: The authors construct SpeechRole-Data (98 roles, 112k conversations) and propose SpeechRole-Eval, a benchmark for evaluating SRPAs in interaction, expressiveness, and fidelity.

Result: Experiments show strengths and challenges of cascaded and end-to-end SRPAs in vocal style consistency and role coherence.

Conclusion: The paper provides a foundation for speech-driven role-playing research by releasing data, code, and models.

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both

### [368] [SpeechR: A Benchmark for Speech Reasoning in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02018)
*Wanqi Yang,Yanda Li,Yunchao Wei,Meng Fang,Ling Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpeechR is a benchmark for evaluating reasoning in large audio-language models (LALMs), focusing on factual retrieval, procedural inference, and normative judgment. It reveals that high transcription accuracy doesn't ensure strong reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LALMs focus on surface-level perception, neglecting contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech.

Method: SpeechR evaluates models using three formats: multiple-choice (answer accuracy), generative (reasoning coherence), and acoustic-feature (impact of stress/emotion).

Result: Evaluations on 11 LALMs show transcription accuracy doesn't correlate with reasoning strength.

Conclusion: SpeechR provides a structured benchmark for analyzing reasoning in spoken language, aiding targeted model improvement.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

*Huihan Li,You Chen,Siyuan Wang,Yixin He,Ninareh Mehrabi,Rahul Gupta,Xiang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STIM is a framework to identify memorization sources in LLMs' reasoning, showing local memorization drives errors and aids in predicting wrong tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail with slight input changes, raising concerns about memorization reliance, especially in Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

Method: Introduces STIM to attribute tokens to memorization sources (local, mid-range, long-range) using pretraining corpus co-occurrence.

Result: Models rely more on memorization in complex cases; local memorization causes up to 67% of wrong tokens. STIM predicts errors effectively.

Conclusion: STIM is a valuable tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning, applicable to other structured tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a
powerful tool for diagnosing and improving model reasoning and can generalize
to other structured step-wise generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that preserves speaker identity across diverse contexts.

Method: Uses speaker-emotion disentanglement with in-batch contrastive learning and rotational emotional embedding for smooth emotion control.

Result: Marco-Voice improves objective and subjective metrics, excelling in speech clarity and emotional richness.

Conclusion: The system represents a significant advance in expressive neural speech synthesis.

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates
voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework.
The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly
expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully
preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts.
Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism
with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of
speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional
embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support
comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality
emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six
professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in
both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis
were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance
in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial
advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

*Soyeon Kim,Jindong Wang,Xing Xie,Steven Euijong Whang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TDBench is a new benchmark for time-sensitive QA tasks, using temporal databases and SQL to create scalable evaluations and introducing a time accuracy metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TSQA benchmarks are limited by manual curation or fixed templates, hindering scalable evaluation.

Method: TDBench constructs TSQA pairs using temporal databases and techniques like temporal SQL and functional dependencies.

Result: The benchmark enables scalable, comprehensive TSQA evaluation and reduces human labor, as shown in experiments on LLMs.

Conclusion: TDBench complements existing TSQA approaches by supporting application-specific data and multi-hop question generation.

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While
factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely
studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed
set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

*Zhentao Xu,Fengyi Li,Albert Chen,Xiaofeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCut is a training-free framework for compressing large-scale LLM prompts by analyzing and pruning low-impact segments, reducing token count by 78% while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale industrial LLM systems face bloated prompts due to iterative additions, leading to high maintenance, latency, and costs.

Method: ProCut segments prompts into semantic units, quantifies their impact, and prunes low-utility components using attribution analysis.

Result: Achieves 78% token reduction in production prompts, with task performance maintained or slightly improved (up to 62% better than alternatives).

Conclusion: ProCut offers an efficient, LLM-agnostic solution for prompt compression, integrating seamlessly with existing frameworks.

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

*Gustaf Ahdritz,Anat Kleiman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Synthetic Media Literacy Test (SMeL Test) to evaluate LLMs' ability to filter untrustworthy content, finding no model consistently outperforms others, with larger models not necessarily better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs can mimic human heuristics for filtering untrustworthy online content, given their increasing role in autonomous web browsing.

Method: Developed the SMeL Test to benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models, on their ability to discern reliable sources.

Result: No model consistently trusted reliable sources; reasoning improved scores but hallucinations remained high (up to 70%). Larger models didn't outperform smaller ones.

Conclusion: The study highlights LLMs' limitations in filtering untrustworthy content and calls for new methods to address this form of hallucination.

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

*Jin Li,Keyu Wang,Shu Yang,Zhuoran Zhang,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the internal mechanisms behind sycophantic behavior in LLMs, identifying a two-stage process and highlighting the role of grammatical perspective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing with user opinions even when they contradict facts, and to explore the underlying mechanisms.

Method: Systematic study of user opinions' impact, logit-lens analysis, causal activation patching, and examination of grammatical perspective effects.

Result: Sycophancy arises from a late-layer output preference shift and deeper representational divergence; first-person prompts induce higher sycophancy than third-person.

Conclusion: Sycophancy in LLMs is a structural issue rooted in deeper layers, with implications for AI alignment and truthfulness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment
and truthful AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores youth-specific toxic language in social media, constructs a Chinese youth-toxicity dataset, and improves detection accuracy by incorporating contextual factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding youth's unique perception of toxic content, which differs from adults.

Method: Constructed a Chinese youth-toxicity dataset and analyzed contextual factors like utterance source and text features.

Result: Incorporating meta-information improved toxicity detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Proposes insights for future youth-centered toxicity detection research.

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

TL;DR: Meta-learning improves small language models' pretraining, making them faster, better, and more interpretable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the cost and improve the interpretability of small language models using meta-learning.

Method: Integrates first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining, tested on four LLama-style models (11M-570M params).

Result: Achieves 1.6x faster convergence, better multilingual NER performance, and reveals interpretable two-stage training dynamics.

Conclusion: Meta-learning enhances small models' efficiency and interpretability, with clear training dynamics signatures.

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

Motivation: To address the latency issue in token-by-token decoding by leveraging non-sequential, parallel generation for faster inference.

Method: Uses discrete-state diffusion for parallel generation, enabling faster inference compared to sequential models.

Result: Achieves 2,146 token/s on H20 GPUs, outperforming Mercury and Gemini Diffusion in speed while maintaining benchmark performance.

Conclusion: Sets a new state-of-the-art on the speed-quality Pareto frontier for code models.

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a
notable speedup to mitigate the inherent latency of token-by-token decoding, as
demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs' mathematical abilities are limited, especially for proof-centric problems, due to scalability and cost issues.

Method: Proposes Proof2Hybrid, a framework using Proof2X to convert proofs into verifiable questions, including hybrid-formatted "$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions."

Result: AlgGeoTest, a 456-item benchmark for algebraic geometry, reveals significant gaps in LLMs' comprehension of advanced mathematics.

Conclusion: Proof2Hybrid enables precise assessment of LLMs' mathematical intelligence, advancing research in AI's mathematical capabilities.

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the interplay between language and culture in LLMs to promote fairness, inclusivity, and alignment.

Method: Extends an established methodology to localize culture-specific neurons, using the MUREL dataset (85.2M tokens across six cultures) for experiments.

Result: LLMs encode cultures in distinct neuron populations, mainly in upper layers, which can be independently modulated.

Conclusion: Cultural knowledge in LLMs can be selectively isolated and edited, enhancing model fairness and inclusivity.

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and understand cross-lingual interference in multilingual Transformer models, especially how it differs from traditional linguistic expectations.

Method: Constructed an interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all possible language pairs among 83 languages.

Result: Interference is asymmetrical and better related to script than language family or embedding similarity. The matrix predicts downstream task performance.

Conclusion: The interference matrix is a practical tool for designing multilingual models to optimize performance, highlighting script as a key factor in interference.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the entropy-performance exchange in RLVR for LLMs, identifying key stages and proposing methods to improve learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the entropy-performance exchange in RLVR and enhance reasoning abilities in LLMs.

Method: Systematic empirical analysis of entropy dynamics across stages and granularities, followed by proposing dynamic reward adjustment methods.

Result: Entropy reduction in negative samples aids learning in the rising stage, while high-entropy tokens in low-perplexity samples correlate with efficiency in the plateau stage. Proposed methods improve performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic reward adjustment based on perplexity and positional information enhances RLVR performance in LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

TL;DR: SHAMI-MT is a bidirectional machine translation system for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the Syrian dialect, achieving high-quality translations with dialectal authenticity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The diglossia between MSA and regional dialects like Syrian poses challenges for NLP, especially machine translation. This work aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Two specialized models (MSA-to-Shami and Shami-to-MSA) were built using AraT5v2-base-1024, fine-tuned on the Nabra dataset, and evaluated on MADAR corpus data.

Result: The MSA-to-Shami model scored 4.01/5.0 in quality, judged by GPT-4.1, showing accurate and authentic translations.

Conclusion: SHAMI-MT advances dialectal Arabic translation, offering applications in localization, cultural heritage, and intercultural communication.

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved
language pair, advancing the field of dialectal Arabic translation and offering
significant applications in content localization, cultural heritage, and
intercultural communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current NLP datasets face issues with restrictive licensing, lack of community updates, and limited quality assurance.

Method: Proposes the Dynaword framework for open, community-driven datasets and implements Danish Dynaword as a proof of concept.

Result: Danish Dynaword is larger, openly licensed, and community-contributed, with quality checks for sustainability.

Conclusion: Dynaword offers a scalable, collaborative solution for NLP dataset challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates four methods for detecting Out-Of-Domain (OOD) queries in RAG systems to ensure safety and relevance, validating their effectiveness on standard datasets and real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring safety and relevance in RAG systems for safety-critical applications is challenging, necessitating robust OOD detection methods.

Method: Four OOD detection methods (GPT-4o, regression-based, PCA-based, Neural Collapse) are evaluated, with novel dimensionality reduction strategies (PCA and Neural Collapse Feature Separation).

Result: The methods are validated on datasets like StackExchange and MSMARCO, and real-world applications (Substance Use, COVID-19), showing external OOD detectors are crucial for relevance.

Conclusion: An external OOD detector is essential for maintaining response relevance and safety in RAG systems.

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector
is crucial for maintaining response relevance.

*Sikui Zhang,Guangze Gao,Ziyun Gan,Chunfeng Yuan,Zefeng Lin,Houwen Peng,Bing Li,Weiming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMPE introduces a training-free method for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs, addressing OOD issues in RoPE by dynamically mapping positions and using multi-grained attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in LLMs when input exceeds pretraining context due to OOD behavior of RoPE. Existing methods ignore dynamic input-context relationships.

Method: LaMPE uses a parametric scaled sigmoid for dynamic position mapping and a multi-grained attention mechanism to balance locality and long-range dependencies.

Result: Significant performance improvements on three LLMs across five benchmarks, outperforming existing length extrapolation methods.

Conclusion: LaMPE effectively adapts LLMs to varying input lengths without training, enhancing long-context performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at

TL;DR: The paper introduces \veomni, a modular training framework for omni-modal LLMs, addressing scalability and efficiency challenges in heterogeneous model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training omni-modal LLMs is hindered by heterogeneous architectures and entangled model-parallel logic, requiring scalable solutions.

Method: \veomni decouples communication from computation, enabling 3D parallelism and flexible modality integration.

Result: The framework achieves 2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scales to 160K context lengths on 128 GPUs.

Conclusion: \veomni demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability for large omni-modal LLM training.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model
architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating
sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing
frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring
limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from
computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also
features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over
2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D
parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for
training large omni-modal LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CAMERA, a framework for compressing Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by analyzing and pruning micro-experts, achieving efficiency without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models face computational and storage inefficiencies despite their performance scaling. Existing methods fail to balance performance and efficiency.

Method: Proposes CAMERA, a training-free framework for micro-expert redundancy analysis, and CAMERA-P (pruning) and CAMERA-Q (quantization) for compression.

Result: CAMERA-P outperforms baselines under 20%-60% pruning, and CAMERA-Q excels in 2-bit quantization. Analysis of Qwen2-57B-A14B is completed in <5 minutes on an A100 GPU.

Conclusion: CAMERA offers an efficient, scalable solution for MoE model compression, maintaining performance while reducing overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

*Jiayi Zhang,Shu Yang,Junchao Wu,Derek F. Wong,Di Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates how fine-tuning LLMs on political topics unintentionally affects their stance on unrelated topics, identifies political neuron types, and proposes a method to mitigate cross-topic generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms of political stance manipulation in LLMs and address unintended cross-topic generalization.

Method: Uses Political Neuron Localization through Activation Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify general and topic-specific political neurons, and introduces InhibitFT for mitigation.

Result: Identified neuron types are robust across models/datasets; InhibitFT reduces cross-topic generalization by 20% while preserving topic-specific performance.

Conclusion: Selectively inhibiting 5% of neurons effectively mitigates cross-topic generalization, offering a practical solution for fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

*Xiaolin Lin,Jingcun Wang,Olga Kondrateva,Yiyu Shi,Bing Li,Grace Li Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CompressKV improves KV cache efficiency in GQA-based LLMs by selectively retaining important tokens using specific attention heads and a layer-adaptive strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inefficiency of heuristic token eviction in KV cache compression, which degrades LLM performance by ignoring attention head functionalities.

Method: Identify and use specific attention heads for token importance, introduce layer-adaptive KV cache allocation, and retain critical KV pairs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks under various memory budgets.

Conclusion: CompressKV enhances memory and execution efficiency in LLMs by focusing on critical tokens and adaptive layer strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

*Linyu Li,Zhi Jin,Yuanpeng He,Dongming Jin,Yichi Zhang,Haoran Duan,Nyima Tash*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BAKE, a continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) model to address catastrophic forgetting in evolving knowledge graphs, using Bayesian updates and continual clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KGE models are static and unsuitable for evolving knowledge graphs, leading to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned knowledge.

Method: BAKE employs Bayesian posterior updates for continual learning and introduces a continual clustering method to constrain knowledge evolution differences.

Result: Experiments show BAKE outperforms existing baseline models in preserving knowledge across multiple snapshots.

Conclusion: BAKE effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting in CKGE, offering a robust solution for evolving knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM framework to measure innovation from unstructured text, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of manual expert evaluations and context-specific proxies in innovation research by leveraging LLMs.

Method: Design an LLM framework to assess innovation from text, tested in two studies (software updates and product reviews).

Result: LLM framework achieved higher F1-scores and consistency than alternative measures and ML/DL models.

Conclusion: The framework provides a reliable, accessible tool for innovation measurement, with insights on design decisions for optimal performance.

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

TL;DR: LatentPrompt is a model-agnostic framework for optimizing LLM prompts using latent semantic space, improving task performance without manual rules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prompt optimization relies on heuristics or manual effort, limiting scalability and efficiency.

Method: Embeds seed prompts in a latent space, explores it systematically, and refines prompts to maximize performance.

Result: Increased classification accuracy by ~3% on the Financial PhraseBank benchmark.

Conclusion: LatentPrompt is broadly applicable, requiring only black-box LLM access and an evaluation metric.

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

TL;DR: The study explores how Facebook fostered collective identity during Bangladesh's 2024 Monsoon Uprising, using multimodal content like memes and hashtags to unify protesters and challenge authoritarian narratives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of Facebook in shaping collective identity and political mobilization during a pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh.

Method: Qualitative analysis of visual rhetoric, verbal discourse, and digital irony in Facebook content, focusing on symbols, protest art, and slogans.

Result: Facebook's multimodal content (e.g., red symbolism, ironic metaphors like "Razakar") unified protesters, mobilized sentiment, and built a strong collective identity.

Conclusion: Online platforms like Facebook are powerful tools for identity construction and political resistance in the digital age.

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

TL;DR: LLMs adjust outputs based on language identity, with deeper layers showing stronger psycholinguistic signals, especially for Chinese prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs encode psycholinguistic knowledge across languages and whether they exhibit human-like responses under different linguistic identities.

Method: Evaluated two models (Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct) using sound symbolism and word valence tasks under monolingual and bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese.

Result: Models adjust outputs based on language identity; Qwen shows greater sensitivity. Psycholinguistic signals are more decodable in deeper layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger valence representations.

Conclusion: Language identity conditions LLM behavior and internal representations, offering insights into their use as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

TL;DR: LLMs use digit-position-specific circuits for arithmetic tasks, independent of model size or tokenization. These circuits are identified and validated using feature importance and causal interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal mechanisms LLMs use for arithmetic tasks, as current understanding is fragmented.

Method: Extend findings on digit-wise number representation, identify circuits via feature importance and causal interventions, and validate their role.

Result: Digit-position-specific circuits exist and causally influence arithmetic task performance, showing a compositional structure.

Conclusion: LLMs employ interpretable, modular circuits for arithmetic, providing insights into their internal strategies.

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally constrained literary texts like Songci.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework with formal conformity, automated quality assessment, human evaluation, and probing tasks. Evaluated 18 LLMs under five prompting strategies and proposed a Generate-Critic architecture for fine-tuning.

Result: Fine-tuned models improved formal conformity by up to 5.88%. The study reveals strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in constrained literary generation.

Conclusion: The Generate-Critic architecture and evaluation framework enhance LLMs' performance in generating constrained literary texts, offering insights for future improvements.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally
constrained literary texts.

Motivation: To understand how large language models like Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct represent phonetic information without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding.

Method: Investigating token-level phonetic representations in Llama, identifying a 'phoneme mover head,' and visualizing its output space.

Result: Llama uses a rich internal phoneme model and organizes phonemes similarly to human IPA vowel charts, despite no direct supervision.

Conclusion: Large language models can develop sophisticated phonetic representations organically, mirroring human-like structures.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

*Karan Reddy,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Contextual Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid model combining GNNs and Transformers for improved performance in technical QA tasks, outperforming GPT-2 and BERT with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard transformers struggle with fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in technical documents, necessitating a specialized solution.

Method: CGT uses GNNs (GATv2Conv) for local structure learning and Transformers for global dependencies, integrated into a RAG pipeline. It's trained in two phases: pretraining on general text and fine-tuning on domain-specific manuals.

Result: CGT achieves 24.7% higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters, excelling in structural token interactions and semantic coherence.

Conclusion: CGT is a parameter-efficient, adaptable model for technical domains, enhancing grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented responses.

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

*Jie Cao,Michael Tanana,Zac E. Imel,Eric Poitras,David C. Atkins,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces neural network models for real-time analysis and forecasting of behavioral codes in Motivational Interviewing (MI) therapy dialogues, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To aid therapists by providing real-time guidance during MI therapy sessions through automated dialogue analysis.

Method: Neural network models for categorizing and forecasting MI behavioral codes in therapy dialogues.

Result: The models outperform baselines in both tasks, with analysis revealing design tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The approach effectively aids therapists by analyzing and forecasting dialogue codes, with potential for real-time guidance.

Abstract: Automatically analyzing dialogue can help understand and guide behavior in
domains such as counseling, where interactions are largely mediated by
conversation. In this paper, we study modeling behavioral codes used to asses a
psychotherapy treatment style called Motivational Interviewing (MI), which is
effective for addressing substance abuse and related problems. Specifically, we
address the problem of providing real-time guidance to therapists with a
dialogue observer that (1) categorizes therapist and client MI behavioral codes
and, (2) forecasts codes for upcoming utterances to help guide the conversation
and potentially alert the therapist. For both tasks, we define neural network
models that build upon recent successes in dialogue modeling. Our experiments
demonstrate that our models can outperform several baselines for both tasks. We
also report the results of a careful analysis that reveals the impact of the
various network design tradeoffs for modeling therapy dialogue.

*Anastasia Zhukova,Terry Ruas,Felix Hamborg,Karsten Donnay,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to automatically identify three types of bias (commission, omission, and source selection) in news articles, offering a joint approach and visualization for analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of discerning reliable and neutral news sources in an information-saturated world drives the need for automated bias detection.

Method: A pipeline methodology is introduced to jointly identify bias types (COSS) and visualize patterns of text reuse.

Result: The approach provides a framework for detecting and visualizing bias in news articles.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances bias detection by unifying COSS analysis and offering practical visualization tools.

Abstract: In a world overwhelmed with news, determining which information comes from
reliable sources or how neutral is the reported information in the news
articles poses a challenge to news readers. In this paper, we propose a
methodology for automatically identifying bias by commission, omission, and
source selection (COSS) as a joint three-fold objective, as opposed to the
previous work separately addressing these types of bias. In a pipeline concept,
we describe the goals and tasks of its steps toward bias identification and
provide an example of a visualization that leverages the extracted features and
patterns of text reuse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces SAGA22, a compact dataset for analyzing math tutoring discourse using talk moves, and explores modeling strategies to improve performance in tutoring settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive challenge of scaling tutoring dialogue analysis for machine learning models.

Method: Uses SAGA22 dataset and explores modeling strategies like dialogue context, speaker information, pretraining, and fine-tuning.

Result: Supplementary pretraining on classroom data improves model performance, especially with longer context and speaker information.

Conclusion: The study highlights the challenges in talk move modeling and the benefits of leveraging existing datasets for tutoring applications.

Abstract: Human tutoring interventions play a crucial role in supporting student
learning, improving academic performance, and promoting personal growth. This
paper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a
framework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,
scaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring
dialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and
resource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,
and explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker
information, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging
existing datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results
demonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model
performance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer
context and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation
studies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to build and align comparable corpora from Wikipedia and EURONEWS in English, French, and Arabic, using cross-lingual similarity measures. CL-LSI outperforms dictionary-based methods and is tested on BBC and ALJAZEERA news.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Comparable corpora are valuable for multilingual NLP where parallel texts are unavailable, providing insights into topic discussions across languages.

Method: Build comparable corpora from Wikipedia and EURONEWS; align documents using bilingual dictionary and CL-LSI measures. Test on BBC and ALJAZEERA news.

Result: CL-LSI outperforms dictionary-based measures, aligning documents at topic and event levels.

Conclusion: CL-LSI is effective for aligning comparable documents across languages, even at finer-grained event levels.

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

### [404] [Towards Actionable Pedagogical Feedback: A Multi-Perspective Analysis of Mathematics Teaching and Tutoring Dialogue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07161)
*Jannatun Naim,Jie Cao,Fareen Tasneem,Jennifer Jacobs,Brent Milne,James Martin,Tamara Sumner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-perspective discourse analysis framework to address challenges in utterance-level analysis of classroom dialogues, integrating talk moves, dialogue acts, and discourse relations for comprehensive feedback in mathematics education.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of utterance-level discourse analysis, such as multifunctionality and exclusion of non-talk-move utterances, in providing effective feedback for instructional practices.

Method: A top-down framework combining domain-specific talk moves, dialogue acts (43-tag SWBD-MASL schema), and discourse relations (16 SDRT relations), applied to two datasets (TalkMoves and SAGA22) with distributional, sequential, and multi-view analyses.

Result: Revealed meaningful discourse patterns and the critical role of non-talk-move utterances in guiding and structuring classroom discourse, highlighting their importance in feedback systems.

Conclusion: The framework enhances AI-assisted education by incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts, improving feedback and supporting the development of AI agents for educational roles.

Abstract: Effective feedback is essential for refining instructional practices in
mathematics education, and researchers often turn to advanced natural language
processing (NLP) models to analyze classroom dialogues from multiple
perspectives. However, utterance-level discourse analysis encounters two
primary challenges: (1) multifunctionality, where a single utterance may serve
multiple purposes that a single tag cannot capture, and (2) the exclusion of
many utterances from domain-specific discourse move classifications, leading to
their omission in feedback. To address these challenges, we proposed a
multi-perspective discourse analysis that integrates domain-specific talk moves
with dialogue act (using the flattened multi-functional SWBD-MASL schema with
43 tags) and discourse relation (applying Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory with 16 relations). Our top-down analysis framework enables a
comprehensive understanding of utterances that contain talk moves, as well as
utterances that do not contain talk moves. This is applied to two mathematics
education datasets: TalkMoves (teaching) and SAGA22 (tutoring). Through
distributional unigram analysis, sequential talk move analysis, and multi-view
deep dive, we discovered meaningful discourse patterns, and revealed the vital
role of utterances without talk moves, demonstrating that these utterances, far
from being mere fillers, serve crucial functions in guiding, acknowledging, and
structuring classroom discourse. These insights underscore the importance of
incorporating discourse relations and dialogue acts into AI-assisted education
systems to enhance feedback and create more responsive learning environments.
Our framework may prove helpful for providing human educator feedback, but also
aiding in the development of AI agents that can effectively emulate the roles
of both educators and students.

*Ali Noori,Pratik Devkota,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A neural sequence labeling approach using a Bi-GRU model achieves 90% F1-score for SNOMED CT concept recognition in clinical text, outperforming rule-based systems and matching neural models with lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of clinical text with SNOMED CT concepts is labor-intensive and impractical at scale, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: A Bidirectional GRU model processes preprocessed text (using domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT) in overlapping 19-token chunks with contextual, syntactic, and morphological features to assign IOB tags for concept spans.

Result: The model achieves a 90% F1-score on validation, surpassing rule-based systems and matching/exceeding neural models, while handling ambiguities and misspellings effectively.

Conclusion: Lightweight RNN-based architectures like Bi-GRU offer high-quality clinical concept annotation with lower computational cost than transformers, making them suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

*Yuerong Song,Xiaoran Liu,Ruixiao Li,Zhigeng Liu,Zengfeng Huang,Qipeng Guo,Ziwei He,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sparse-dLLM is a training-free framework that improves efficiency in diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) by selectively caching pivotal tokens and evicting unimportant ones, achieving higher throughput with comparable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current caching techniques in dLLMs impose high memory usage, limiting long-context applications. Attention patterns reveal persistent sparsity, motivating selective cache eviction.

Method: Sparse-dLLM integrates dynamic cache eviction with sparse attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching, leveraging token saliency stability.

Result: Achieves up to 10× higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance and similar peak memory costs.

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM outperforms previous methods in efficiency and effectiveness for dLLM inference.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

*Xiaoyu Pan,Yang Bai,Ke Zou,Yang Zhou,Jun Zhou,Huazhu Fu,Yih-Chung Tham,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EH-Benchmark evaluates hallucinations in Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) for ophthalmic diagnosis, proposing a multi-agent framework to improve accuracy and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs face accuracy issues due to hallucinations from limited ophthalmic knowledge, poor visual reasoning, and lack of multimodal data. Existing benchmarks fail to address these effectively.

Method: Introduces EH-Benchmark, categorizing hallucinations into Visual Understanding and Logical Composition. Proposes a three-phase framework: Knowledge-Level Retrieval, Task-Level Case Studies, and Result-Level Validation.

Result: The multi-agent framework significantly reduces hallucinations, improving accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Conclusion: EH-Benchmark and the proposed framework effectively address hallucinations in MLLMs, enhancing their diagnostic capabilities in ophthalmology.

Abstract: Medical Large Language Models (MLLMs) play a crucial role in ophthalmic
diagnosis, holding significant potential to address vision-threatening
diseases. However, their accuracy is constrained by hallucinations stemming
from limited ophthalmic knowledge, insufficient visual localization and
reasoning capabilities, and a scarcity of multimodal ophthalmic data, which
collectively impede precise lesion detection and disease diagnosis.
Furthermore, existing medical benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate various
types of hallucinations or provide actionable solutions to mitigate them. To
address the above challenges, we introduce EH-Benchmark, a novel ophthalmology
benchmark designed to evaluate hallucinations in MLLMs. We categorize MLLMs'
hallucinations based on specific tasks and error types into two primary
classes: Visual Understanding and Logical Composition, each comprising multiple
subclasses. Given that MLLMs predominantly rely on language-based reasoning
rather than visual processing, we propose an agent-centric, three-phase
framework, including the Knowledge-Level Retrieval stage, the Task-Level Case
Studies stage, and the Result-Level Validation stage. Experimental results show
that our multi-agent framework significantly mitigates both types of
hallucinations, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and reliability. Our
project is available at https://github.com/ppxy1/EH-Benchmark.

*Jérémie Dentan,Davide Buscaldi,Sonia Vanier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes verbatim memorization in LLMs, critiques the existing taxonomy, and proposes a new one aligned with attention weights, revealing insights into memorization mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the distinct mechanisms behind verbatim memorization in LLMs and evaluate the alignment of existing taxonomies with attention weights.

Method: Train CNNs on LLM attention weights and evaluate taxonomy alignment, proposing a new three-category taxonomy.

Result: Existing taxonomy poorly reflects attention mechanisms; new taxonomy shows memorized samples are guessed or recalled, with few-shot memorization lacking distinct attention patterns.

Conclusion: A new taxonomy better captures memorization mechanisms, and many extractable samples are guessed, requiring separate study.

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

*Eman Alamoudi,Ellis Solaiman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EHSAN introduces a hybrid pipeline combining ChatGPT pseudo-labelling and human review to create the first explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare, achieving high accuracy with minimal human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic-language patient feedback is under-analysed due to dialect diversity and lack of aspect-level sentiment labels, hindering automated assessment.

Method: A hybrid pipeline merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with human review to annotate sentences with aspects and sentiment labels, creating three training data versions (fully supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised). Two transformer models are fine-tuned for classification.

Result: High accuracy was achieved even with minimal human supervision, with only a minor performance drop using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing aspect classes improved classification metrics.

Conclusion: The approach is effective and scalable for Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis in healthcare, combining large language models and human expertise. Future work includes generalization, prompt refinement, and interpretable modelling.

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

*Ming Pok Ng,Junqi Jiang,Gabriel Freedman,Antonio Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MArgE is a framework for structured argumentation in LLMs, improving claim verification by outperforming single LLMs and unstructured multi-LLM methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of structured, justifiable interactions in combining multiple LLM outputs for tasks like claim verification.

Method: Uses Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs) to build structured argument trees for claims, ensuring inspectable and faithful justification.

Result: MArgE significantly outperforms single LLMs (including GPT-4o-mini) and unstructured multi-LLM debate methods.

Conclusion: Formal argumentative reasoning enhances the reliability and performance of multi-LLM systems.

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

*Omri Uzan,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CharBench is a large-scale benchmark for character-level tasks, revealing modern LLMs struggle with such tasks, averaging 43.6% and 32.3% accuracy. Tokenization's impact varies by task type.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Character-level tasks challenge language models, but the role of tokenization is unclear. CharBench aims to clarify this and evaluate model performance.

Method: Introduce CharBench, a large benchmark, and evaluate diverse LLMs. Analyze word properties, tokenization, and their correlation with task performance.

Result: LLMs perform poorly on CharBench (43.6% avg. accuracy). Tokenization weakly affects counting tasks but hinders positional tasks with longer tokens.

Conclusion: CharBench highlights LLMs' limitations in character-level reasoning. Future work should use it to improve model performance on such tasks.

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

### [412] [Mitigating Attention Hacking in Preference-Based Reward Modeling via Interaction Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02618)
*Jianxiang Zang,Meiling Ning,Shihan Dou,Jiazheng Zhang,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the issue of 'attention hacking' in reward models (RMs) for RLHF in LLMs, proposing 'Interaction Distillation' to improve token-level interaction and attention alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RMs suffer from inadequate token-level interaction due to unidirectional attention and lack of inter-sequence attention, making them vulnerable to 'attention hacking.'

Method: Proposes 'Interaction Distillation,' using a teacher model to guide RMs in simulating better token interaction patterns via attentional alignment.

Result: The method provides more stable and generalizable reward signals, outperforming state-of-the-art RM optimization methods.

Conclusion: Attention hacking is a fundamental limitation in RMs, and Interaction Distillation effectively addresses it.

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pointer is a new architecture for efficient long-range sequence modeling with linear complexity, outperforming standard attention mechanisms in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of standard attention mechanisms (O(N^2)) for long sequences, Pointer aims to provide a faster, pre-training-free alternative with explicit long-distance connections.

Method: Pointer uses layer-wise pointer chaining, where each layer's pointer selection depends on previous layers, creating long-distance connections through pointer chains.

Result: Pointer achieves 2–10× speedup on long sequences, >95% accuracy on copy tasks up to 2048 tokens, and learns interpretable pointer patterns.

Conclusion: Pointer is a viable alternative to attention mechanisms for efficient long-range modeling without pre-training, offering speed, accuracy, and interpretability.

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper highlights quality issues in multilingual benchmark datasets, identifies errors in French and Telugu datasets, and shows significant performance differences in LLMs when using revised datasets. It advocates for revisiting and versioning test sets to ensure correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of attention to dataset quality in multilingual benchmarks, despite known issues in human-annotated test sets.

Method: Manual analysis of multilingual evaluation sets in French and Telugu, identifying errors and comparing LLM performance on original vs. revised datasets.

Result: Large performance differences (up to 10%) in LLMs when using revised datasets, highlighting dataset quality issues.

Conclusion: Test sets should be revisited, corrected, and versioned; recommendations are provided for dataset creators and consumers to improve quality.

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an updated PCS framework for veridical data science to address uncertainty in AI-driven data science, emphasizing reproducibility and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the challenge of non-replicable AI-driven findings due to uncertainty in the data science life cycle.

Abstract: Data science is a pillar of artificial intelligence (AI), which is
transforming nearly every domain of human activity, from the social and
physical sciences to engineering and medicine. While data-driven findings in AI
offer unprecedented power to extract insights and guide decision-making, many
are difficult or impossible to replicate. A key reason for this challenge is
the uncertainty introduced by the many choices made throughout the data science
life cycle (DSLC). Traditional statistical frameworks often fail to account for
this uncertainty. The Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework
for veridical (truthful) data science offers a principled approach to
addressing this challenge throughout the DSLC. This paper presents an updated
and streamlined PCS workflow, tailored for practitioners and enhanced with
guided use of generative AI. We include a running example to display the PCS
framework in action, and conduct a related case study which showcases the
uncertainty in downstream predictions caused by judgment calls in the data
cleaning stage.

*Ziyang Zhang,Feifan Zhang,Weidong Tang,Lei Shi,Tailai Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed Transformer via GAN is proposed to address unresolved residuals and temporal causality violations in PINNs, achieving significant MSE reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PINNs struggle with unresolved residuals and temporal causality in modeling nonlinear PDEs, limiting their effectiveness for complex physical systems.

Method: The framework combines a decoder-only Transformer for temporal correlations with a residual-aware GAN, using a causal penalty term and adaptive sampling to improve accuracy.

Result: Extensive experiments show relative MSE reductions of up to three orders of magnitude on Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations.

Conclusion: The method bridges deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

Abstract: Nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) are pivotal in modeling
complex physical systems, yet traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks
(PINNs) often struggle with unresolved residuals in critical spatiotemporal
regions and violations of temporal causality. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel Residual Guided Training strategy for Physics-Informed
Transformer via Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our framework integrates
a decoder-only Transformer to inherently capture temporal correlations through
autoregressive processing, coupled with a residual-aware GAN that dynamically
identifies and prioritizes high-residual regions. By introducing a causal
penalty term and an adaptive sampling mechanism, the method enforces temporal
causality while refining accuracy in problematic domains. Extensive numerical
experiments on the Allen-Cahn, Klein-Gordon, and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate significant improvements, achieving relative MSE reductions of up
to three orders of magnitude compared to baseline methods. This work bridges
the gap between deep learning and physics-driven modeling, offering a robust
solution for multiscale and time-dependent PDE systems.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured protocol to integrate geospatial foundation models into operational mapping systems, demonstrating improved performance in crop mapping via fine-tuning a pre-trained model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the gap between promising benchmark results and real-world deployment challenges of geospatial foundation models in remote sensing applications.

Method: A three-step protocol: defining application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data, and rigorous empirical testing, applied to the Presto model for crop mapping.

Result: Fine-tuning the Presto model significantly outperforms conventional supervised methods, showcasing strong spatial and temporal generalization.

Conclusion: The protocol offers a replicable blueprint for practitioners and a foundation for future research to operationalize geospatial foundation models in diverse remote sensing applications.

Abstract: The increasing availability of geospatial foundation models has the potential
to transform remote sensing applications such as land cover classification,
environmental monitoring, and change detection. Despite promising benchmark
results, the deployment of these models in operational settings is challenging
and rare. Standardized evaluation tasks often fail to capture real-world
complexities relevant for end-user adoption such as data heterogeneity,
resource constraints, and application-specific requirements. This paper
presents a structured approach to integrate geospatial foundation models into
operational mapping systems. Our protocol has three key steps: defining
application requirements, adapting the model to domain-specific data and
conducting rigorous empirical testing. Using the Presto model in a case study
for crop mapping, we demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained model
significantly improves performance over conventional supervised methods. Our
results highlight the model's strong spatial and temporal generalization
capabilities. Our protocol provides a replicable blueprint for practitioners
and lays the groundwork for future research to operationalize foundation models
in diverse remote sensing applications. Application of the protocol to the
WorldCereal global crop-mapping system showcases the framework's scalability.

Abstract: The article explores an encoding and structural information processing

following are presented: a discrete method of speculative stochastic
dimensionality reduction of multidimensional code and linear spaces with linear
asymptotic complexity; a geometric method for obtaining discrete embeddings of
an organised code space that reflect the internal structure of a given
modality. The structure and properties of a code space are investigated using
three modalities as examples: morphology of Russian and English languages, and
immunohistochemical markers. Parallels are drawn between the resulting map of
the code space layout and so-called pinwheels appearing on the mammalian
neocortex. A cautious assumption is made about similarities between neocortex
organisation and processes happening in our models.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework predicts axial load-bearing capacity of cold-formed steel members, using Gradient Boosting Regression and SHAP for interpretability, integrated into a user-friendly web tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of traditional methods in capturing nonlinearities and complexities in buckling behavior of steel columns.

Method: Curated dataset with pre-processing, evaluated regression algorithms, selected Gradient Boosting Regression, and used SHAP for interpretability. Integrated into a Python-based web tool.

Result: Gradient Boosting Regression outperformed other models in predictive performance (R2, RMSE, MAE). SHAP provided insights into feature importance and interactions.

Conclusion: The framework enhances design safety, streamlines workflows, and aids decision-making in structural applications, particularly for buckling-critical scenarios.

Abstract: In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework to predict the
axial load-bearing capacity, (kN), of cold-formed steel structural members. The
methodology emphasizes robust model selection and interpretability, addressing
the limitations of traditional analytical approaches in capturing the
nonlinearities and geometrical complexities inherent to buckling behavior. The
dataset, comprising key geometric and mechanical parameters of steel columns,
was curated with appropriate pre-processing steps including removal of
non-informative identifiers and imputation of missing values. A comprehensive
suite of regression algorithms, ranging from linear models to kernel-based
regressors and ensemble tree methods was evaluated. Among these, Gradient
Boosting Regression exhibited superior predictive performance across multiple
metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared
error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), and was consequently selected as
the final model. Model interpretability was addressed using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP), enabling insight into the relative importance and
interaction of input features influencing the predicted axial capacity. To
facilitate practical deployment, the model was integrated into an interactive,
Python-based web interface via Streamlit. This tool allows end-users-such as
structural engineers and designers, to input design parameters manually or
through CSV upload, and to obtain real-time predictions of axial load capacity
without the need for programming expertise. Applied to the context of steel
storage rack columns, the framework demonstrates how data-driven tools can
enhance design safety, streamline validation workflows, and inform
decision-making in structural applications where buckling is a critical failure
mode

*Chao Yan,Babak Mafakheri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML predicts satellite signal quality for fast-moving objects, achieving high accuracy (F1 score 0.97) and enabling proactive network switching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for reliable satellite connectivity in fast-moving objects like aircraft, especially in areas lacking terrestrial coverage.

Method: Analyzed real GEO satellite-aircraft communication data using ML to predict signal quality.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 0.97, demonstrating accurate signal quality prediction.

Conclusion: ML can enhance satellite connectivity by enabling proactive switching and can be adapted for other moving objects.

Abstract: Satellite connectivity is gaining increased attention as the demand for
seamless internet access, especially in transportation and remote areas,
continues to grow. For fast-moving objects such as aircraft, vehicles, or
trains, satellite connectivity is critical due to their mobility and frequent
presence in areas without terrestrial coverage. Maintaining reliable
connectivity in these cases requires frequent switching between satellite
beams, constellations, or orbits. To enhance user experience and address
challenges like long switching times, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can
analyze historical connectivity data and predict network quality at specific
locations. This allows for proactive measures, such as network switching before
connectivity issues arise. In this paper, we analyze a real dataset of
communication between a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellite and aircraft over
multiple flights, using ML to predict signal quality. Our prediction model
achieved an F1 score of 0.97 on the test data, demonstrating the accuracy of
machine learning in predicting signal quality during flight. By enabling
seamless broadband service, including roaming between different satellite
constellations and providers, our model addresses the need for real-time
predictions of signal quality. This approach can further be adapted to automate
satellite and beam-switching mechanisms to improve overall communication
efficiency. The model can also be retrained and applied to any moving object
with satellite connectivity, using customized datasets, including connected
vehicles and trains.

*Moutaz Bellah Bentrad,Adel Ghoggal,Tahar Bahi,Abderaouf Bahi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-free fault diagnosis method for induction machines using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is proposed, achieving high accuracy without signal preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of complex, costly model-based methods in diagnosing induction machine faults.

Method: Uses raw current and vibration signals with GNNs to automatically extract features and detect faults like eccentricity, bearing defects, and broken rotor bars.

Result: Achieves 92.5% accuracy for eccentricity, 91.2% for bearing faults, and 93.1% for broken rotor bars.

Conclusion: The GNN-based framework is robust, lightweight, and a promising alternative to traditional model-based techniques.

Abstract: The diagnosis of induction machines has traditionally relied on model-based
methods that require the development of complex dynamic models, making them
difficult to implement and computationally expensive. To overcome these
limitations, this paper proposes a model-free approach using Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for fault diagnosis in induction machines. The focus is on
detecting multiple fault types -- including eccentricity, bearing defects, and
broken rotor bars -- under varying severity levels and load conditions. Unlike
traditional approaches, raw current and vibration signals are used as direct
inputs, eliminating the need for signal preprocessing or manual feature
extraction. The proposed GNN-ASE model automatically learns and extracts
relevant features from raw inputs, leveraging the graph structure to capture
complex relationships between signal types and fault patterns. It is evaluated
for both individual fault detection and multi-class classification of combined
fault conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed model, achieving 92.5\% accuracy for eccentricity defects, 91.2\% for
bearing faults, and 93.1\% for broken rotor bar detection. These findings
highlight the model's robustness and generalization capability across different
operational scenarios. The proposed GNN-based framework offers a lightweight
yet powerful solution that simplifies implementation while maintaining high
diagnostic performance. It stands as a promising alternative to conventional
model-based diagnostic techniques for real-world induction machine monitoring
and predictive maintenance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines reproducibility issues in ML applications for building energy systems, finding widespread lack of transparency and reproducibility, with most studies failing to disclose datasets or share code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding how reproducibility challenges manifest in applied ML disciplines, specifically building energy systems.

Method: Analyzed transparency and reproducibility standards of ML applications in building energy systems, focusing on dataset disclosure, code sharing, and authorship.

Result: Nearly all articles were non-reproducible due to insufficient disclosure; 72% lacked dataset details, and only two shared code (one broken). No significant difference in reproducibility between academic and industry-affiliated authors.

Conclusion: Targeted interventions like guidelines, training, and policies are needed to improve transparency and reproducibility in ML research.

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, enabling independent
verification and validation of empirical findings. The topic gained prominence
in fields such as psychology and medicine, where concerns about non -
replicable results sparked ongoing discussions about research practices. In
recent years, the fast-growing field of Machine Learning (ML) has become part
of this discourse, as it faces similar concerns about transparency and
reliability. Some reproducibility issues in ML research are shared with other
fields, such as limited access to data and missing methodological details. In
addition, ML introduces specific challenges, including inherent nondeterminism
and computational constraints. While reproducibility issues are increasingly
recognized by the ML community and its major conferences, less is known about
how these challenges manifest in applied disciplines. This paper contributes to
closing this gap by analyzing the transparency and reproducibility standards of
ML applications in building energy systems. The results indicate that nearly
all articles are not reproducible due to insufficient disclosure across key
dimensions of reproducibility. 72% of the articles do not specify whether the
dataset used is public, proprietary, or commercially available. Only two papers
share a link to their code - one of which was broken. Two-thirds of the
publications were authored exclusively by academic researchers, yet no
significant differences in reproducibility were observed compared to
publications with industry-affiliated authors. These findings highlight the
need for targeted interventions, including reproducibility guidelines, training
for researchers, and policies by journals and conferences that promote
transparency and reproducibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination definitions and methods in NLP foundation models lack analogs for MVTS models, hindering their safe adoption.

Method: Proposes new definitions for MVTS hallucination, uses a diffusion model for detection and mitigation, and benchmarks relational hallucination levels.

Result: Pre-trained MVTS models hallucinate up to 59.5% as much as a baseline; mitigation reduces this by up to 47.7%.

Conclusion: The proposed definitions and methods enhance the safe adoption of MVTS foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

*Zhenan Lin,Yuni Lai,Wai Lun Lo,Richard Tai-Chiu Hsung,Harris Sik-Ho Tsang,Xiaoyu Xue,Kai Zhou,Yulin Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-grained temporal-spatial graph learning framework is proposed to enhance traffic flow forecasting by balancing local and global patterns, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic traffic flow forecasting struggle with encoding global temporal-spatial patterns and overfitting on pre-defined correlations, limiting robustness.

Method: The framework uses a graph transformer encoder for global patterns, graph convolution for local patterns, and a gated fusion unit with residual connections to combine them.

Result: The model demonstrates strong representation capability and consistently outperforms baselines on real-world traffic networks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mines hidden global relations and balances local-global patterns, improving forecasting robustness.

Abstract: Time-evolving traffic flow forecasting are playing a vital role in
intelligent transportation systems and smart cities. However, the dynamic
traffic flow forecasting is a highly nonlinear problem with complex
temporal-spatial dependencies. Although the existing methods has provided great
contributions to mine the temporal-spatial patterns in the complex traffic
networks, they fail to encode the globally temporal-spatial patterns and are
prone to overfit on the pre-defined geographical correlations, and thus hinder
the model's robustness on the complex traffic environment. To tackle this
issue, in this work, we proposed a multi-grained temporal-spatial graph
learning framework to adaptively augment the globally temporal-spatial patterns
obtained from a crafted graph transformer encoder with the local patterns from
the graph convolution by a crafted gated fusion unit with residual connection
techniques. Under these circumstances, our proposed model can mine the hidden
global temporal-spatial relations between each monitor stations and balance the
relative importance of local and global temporal-spatial patterns. Experiment
results demonstrate the strong representation capability of our proposed method
and our model consistently outperforms other strong baselines on various
real-world traffic networks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel relaxation framework (FRA) for graph matching, addressing errors in existing methods by reformulating the projection step with a tunable regularization term. The SDSN algorithm and mixed-precision architecture enhance efficiency and accuracy, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection-based relaxations for graph matching introduce errors due to numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment. The goal is to mitigate these errors while maintaining accuracy.

Method: The authors reformulate the projection step as a Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, introduce the SDSN algorithm, and develop a mixed-precision architecture for acceleration.

Result: FRAM outperforms baseline methods in CPU benchmarks and achieves up to 370X speedup with GPU-based mixed-precision, with negligible accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The proposed FRA framework and SDSN algorithm effectively address errors in graph matching relaxations, offering improved accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

*Amir Hossein Kalantari,Eleonora Papadimitriou,Amir Pooyan Afghari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a dynamic framework for identifying risky driving behavior using naturalistic driving data, employing rolling time windows and bi-level optimization. It evaluates three models (DNN, XGBoost, Random Forest) and highlights DNN for high-recall tasks and XGBoost for balanced performance. Speed-weighted headway is noted as a stable risk indicator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks for risky driving behavior detection rely on fixed time windows and static thresholds, limiting adaptability to real-world driving's stochastic nature. This study aims to address this gap with a dynamic, individualized approach.

Method: The study uses Belgian naturalistic driving data, employing a rolling time window and bi-level optimization to dynamically calibrate risk thresholds and model hyperparameters. It evaluates speed-weighted headway and harsh driving events using Random Forest, XGBoost, and DNN models.

Result: DNN excelled in high-recall tasks, XGBoost showed balanced performance, and Random Forest was sensitive to dynamic adjustments. Speed-weighted headway proved more stable than harsh driving events as a risk indicator.

Conclusion: The findings advocate for adaptive, personalized risk detection frameworks to improve real-time safety feedback and driver support in intelligent transport systems.

Abstract: Naturalistic driving studies offer a powerful means for observing and
quantifying real-world driving behaviour. One of their prominent applications
in traffic safety is the continuous monitoring and classification of risky
driving behaviour. However, many existing frameworks rely on fixed time windows
and static thresholds for distinguishing between safe and risky behaviour -
limiting their ability to respond to the stochastic nature of real-world
driving. This study proposes a dynamic and individualised framework for
identifying risky driving behaviour using Belgian naturalistic driving data.
The approach leverages a rolling time window and bi-level optimisation to
dynamically calibrate both risk thresholds and model hyperparameters, capturing
subtle behavioural shifts. Two safety indicators, speed-weighted headway and
harsh driving events, were evaluated using three data-driven models: Random
Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The DNN demonstrated strong
capability in capturing subtle changes in driving behaviour, particularly
excelling in high-recall tasks, making it promising for early-stage risk
detection. XGBoost provided the most balanced and stable performance across
different thresholds and evaluation metrics. While random forest showed more
variability, it responded sensitively to dynamic threshold adjustments, which
may be advantageous during model adaptation or tuning. Speed-weighted headway
emerged as a more stable and context-sensitive risk indicator than harsh
driving events, likely due to its robustness to label sparsity and contextual
variation. Overall, the findings support the value of adaptive, personalised
risk detection approaches for enhancing real-time safety feedback and tailoring
driver support in intelligent transport systems.

*Julien Simon de Kergunic,Rony Abecidan,Patrick Bas,Vincent Itier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning-based splicing detectors struggle with post-processing variations. Training variants under different conditions and selecting the one with maximal latent margins improves robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning forensic tools are sensitive to training conditions and post-processing, limiting their practical reliability.

Method: Train multiple model variants under different conditions and select the one with the largest latent margins to enhance robustness.

Result: Latent margin distribution correlates with generalization to post-processed images, guiding model selection for better performance.

Conclusion: Maximizing latent margins during model selection can improve the robustness of splicing detectors against post-processing.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in splicing detection, deep learning-based forensic
tools remain difficult to deploy in practice due to their high sensitivity to
training conditions. Even mild post-processing applied to evaluation images can
significantly degrade detector performance, raising concerns about their
reliability in operational contexts. In this work, we show that the same deep
architecture can react very differently to unseen post-processing depending on
the learned weights, despite achieving similar accuracy on in-distribution test
data. This variability stems from differences in the latent spaces induced by
training, which affect how samples are separated internally. Our experiments
reveal a strong correlation between the distribution of latent margins and a
detector's ability to generalize to post-processed images. Based on this
observation, we propose a practical strategy for building more robust
detectors: train several variants of the same model under different conditions,
and select the one that maximizes latent margins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how transformers acquire and extract knowledge, introducing a one-layer framework with self-attention and MLPs to prove convergence and generalization guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the theoretical opacity of how transformers store and retrieve knowledge, especially given prior limitations to single-layer, attention-only models and the empirical incapability of such models to handle factual knowledge.

Method: A tractable one-layer transformer framework incorporating self-attention and MLPs, analyzed through gradient dynamics for convergence and generalization guarantees.

Result: Transformers achieve near-optimal training loss (knowledge acquisition) and low generalization error under specific conditions (knowledge extraction), but fail otherwise, leading to hallucinations.

Conclusion: The framework provides theoretical insights into knowledge acquisition and extraction, validated by experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

Motivation: To understand how universal neurons—neurons with correlated activations across independently trained models—develop and influence model behavior.

Method: Analyzed five GPT-2 models at three training checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k steps) using pairwise correlation of activations on 5M tokens. Conducted ablation tests to measure functional impact via loss and KL divergence.

Result: Universal neurons significantly affect predictions and show high stability, especially in deeper layers, indicating stable representational structures.

Conclusion: Stable and universal neuron structures emerge during training, suggesting inherent patterns in neural network learning.

Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of neuron universality in independently trained
GPT-2 Small models, examining how these universal neurons-neurons with
consistently correlated activations across models-emerge and evolve throughout
training. By analyzing five GPT-2 models at three checkpoints (100k, 200k, 300k

activations over a dataset of 5 million tokens. Ablation experiments reveal
significant functional impacts of universal neurons on model predictions,
measured via loss and KL divergence. Additionally, we quantify neuron
persistence, demonstrating high stability of universal neurons across training
checkpoints, particularly in deeper layers. These findings suggest stable and
universal representational structures emerge during neural network training.

Method: NeuCoReClass AD integrates contrastive, reconstruction, and classification proxy tasks with neural transformation learning for diverse and coherent data augmentation.

Result: The framework consistently outperforms classical baselines and deep-learning alternatives across benchmarks and characterizes anomaly profiles unsupervised.

Conclusion: NeuCoReClass AD addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a robust and generalizable solution for time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a critical role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Among unsupervised approaches, self-supervised
learning has gained traction for modeling normal behavior without the need of
labeled data. However, many existing methods rely on a single proxy task,
limiting their ability to capture meaningful patterns in normal data. Moreover,
they often depend on handcrafted transformations tailored specific domains,
hindering their generalization accross diverse problems. To address these
limitations, we introduce NeuCoReClass AD, a self-supervised multi-task time
series anomaly detection framework that combines contrastive, reconstruction,
and classification proxy tasks. Our method employs neural transformation
learning to generate augmented views that are informative, diverse, and
coherent, without requiring domain-specific knowledge. We evaluate NeuCoReClass
AD across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating that it consistently
outperforms both classical baselines and most deep-learning alternatives.
Furthermore, it enables the characterization of distinct anomaly profiles in a
fully unsupervised manner.

*Ziyao Wang,Guoheng Sun,Yexiao He,Zheyu Shen,Bowei Tian,Ang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PALACE is a user-side framework for auditing hidden token usage in LLM services, addressing concerns of token inflation and overbilling by estimating reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Commercial LLM services hide internal reasoning traces, potentially leading to token inflation and overbilling, creating a need for reliable token auditing.

Method: PALACE uses a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a lightweight domain router to dynamically calibrate token count estimates across diverse reasoning tasks.

Result: Experiments show PALACE achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: PALACE advances predictive auditing, enhancing transparency and user trust in LLM services.

Abstract: Commercial LLM services often conceal internal reasoning traces while still
charging users for every generated token, including those from hidden
intermediate steps, raising concerns of token inflation and potential
overbilling. This gap underscores the urgent need for reliable token auditing,
yet achieving it is far from straightforward: cryptographic verification (e.g.,
hash-based signature) offers little assurance when providers control the entire
execution pipeline, while user-side prediction struggles with the inherent
variance of reasoning LLMs, where token usage fluctuates across domains and
prompt styles. To bridge this gap, we present PALACE (Predictive Auditing of
LLM APIs via Reasoning Token Count Estimation), a user-side framework that
estimates hidden reasoning token counts from prompt-answer pairs without access
to internal traces. PALACE introduces a GRPO-augmented adaptation module with a
lightweight domain router, enabling dynamic calibration across diverse
reasoning tasks and mitigating variance in token usage patterns. Experiments on
math, coding, medical, and general reasoning benchmarks show that PALACE
achieves low relative error and strong prediction accuracy, supporting both
fine-grained cost auditing and inflation detection. Taken together, PALACE
represents an important first step toward standardized predictive auditing,
offering a practical path to greater transparency, accountability, and user
trust.

### [434] [CaliMatch: Adaptive Calibration for Improving Safe Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00922)
*Jinsoo Bae,Seoung Bum Kim,Hyungrok Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CaliMatch improves semi-supervised learning by calibrating classifier and OOD detector to address overconfidence, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address label distribution mismatch and overconfidence in SSL, which leads to incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection errors.

Method: Proposes CaliMatch with adaptive label smoothing and temperature scaling for calibration, eliminating manual tuning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods on datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet.

Conclusion: CaliMatch effectively enhances safe SSL by improving calibration, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) uses unlabeled data to improve the performance
of machine learning models when labeled data is scarce. However, its real-world
applications often face the label distribution mismatch problem, in which the
unlabeled dataset includes instances whose ground-truth labels are absent from
the labeled training dataset. Recent studies, referred to as safe SSL, have
addressed this issue by using both classification and out-of-distribution (OOD)
detection. However, the existing methods may suffer from overconfidence in deep
neural networks, leading to increased SSL errors because of high confidence in
incorrect pseudo-labels or OOD detection. To address this, we propose a novel
method, CaliMatch, which calibrates both the classifier and the OOD detector to
foster safe SSL. CaliMatch presents adaptive label smoothing and temperature
scaling, which eliminates the need to manually tune the smoothing degree for
effective calibration. We give a theoretical justification for why improving
the calibration of both the classifier and the OOD detector is crucial in safe
SSL. Extensive evaluations on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, TinyImageNet, and
ImageNet demonstrate that CaliMatch outperforms the existing methods in safe
SSL tasks.

### [435] [Beyond Benchmarks: Dynamic, Automatic And Systematic Red-Teaming Agents For Trustworthy Medical Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00923)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic, automatic, and systematic (DAS) red-teaming framework is proposed to continuously test LLMs in clinical settings, revealing vulnerabilities in robustness, privacy, bias/fairness, and hallucination that static benchmarks miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the rapid advancement of LLMs and the obsolescence of static safety benchmarks, ensuring their reliability in healthcare applications.

Method: A DAS red-teaming framework with adversarial agents autonomously mutates test cases, evolves unsafe-triggering strategies, and evaluates responses in real time.

Result: Applied to 15 LLMs, DAS revealed high failure rates: 94% in robustness, 86% in privacy, 81% in bias/fairness, and 66% in hallucination, despite high static benchmark performance.

Conclusion: DAS offers a scalable, evolvable safeguard for medical AI, addressing residual risks incompatible with clinical practice.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and reliability of large language models (LLMs) in
clinical practice is critical to prevent patient harm and promote trustworthy
healthcare applications of AI. However, LLMs are advancing so rapidly that
static safety benchmarks often become obsolete upon publication, yielding only
an incomplete and sometimes misleading picture of model trustworthiness. We
demonstrate that a Dynamic, Automatic, and Systematic (DAS) red-teaming
framework that continuously stress-tests LLMs can reveal significant weaknesses
of current LLMs across four safety-critical domains: robustness, privacy,
bias/fairness, and hallucination. A suite of adversarial agents is applied to
autonomously mutate test cases, identify/evolve unsafe-triggering strategies,
and evaluate responses, uncovering vulnerabilities in real time without human
intervention. Applying DAS to 15 proprietary and open-source LLMs revealed a
stark contrast between static benchmark performance and vulnerability under
adversarial pressure. Despite a median MedQA accuracy exceeding 80\%, 94\% of
previously correct answers failed our dynamic robustness tests. We observed
similarly high failure rates across other domains: privacy leaks were elicited
in 86\% of scenarios, cognitive-bias priming altered clinical recommendations
in 81\% of fairness tests, and we identified hallucination rates exceeding 66\%
in widely used models. Such profound residual risks are incompatible with
routine clinical practice. By converting red-teaming from a static checklist
into a dynamic stress-test audit, DAS red-teaming offers the surveillance that
hospitals/regulators/technology vendors require as LLMs become embedded in
patient chatbots, decision-support dashboards, and broader healthcare
workflows. Our framework delivers an evolvable, scalable, and reliable
safeguard for the next generation of medical AI.

*Feng Xu,Hui Wang,Yuting Huang,Danwei Zhang,Zizhu Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hybrid Hypergraph Network (HHN) to model temporal multimodal data, addressing challenges in capturing dependencies and cross-modal interactions. It achieves SOTA results on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches fail to capture long-range temporal dependencies and cross-modal interactions in temporal multimodal data, limiting performance in classification tasks.

Method: HHN uses a segmentation-first, graph-later strategy, splitting sequences into timestamped segments. It captures intra-modal structures via hyperedges and extracts dependencies with hypergraph convolution, while inter-modal links are established through temporal alignment and graph attention.

Result: HHN achieves state-of-the-art results on four multimodal datasets, proving its effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HHN framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering a robust solution for modeling temporal multimodal data.

Abstract: Modeling temporal multimodal data poses significant challenges in
classification tasks, particularly in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies and intricate cross-modal interactions. Audiovisual data, as a
representative example, is inherently characterized by strict temporal order
and diverse modalities. Effectively leveraging the temporal structure is
essential for understanding both intra-modal dynamics and inter-modal
correlations. However, most existing approaches treat each modality
independently and rely on shallow fusion strategies, which overlook temporal
dependencies and hinder the model's ability to represent complex structural
relationships. To address the limitation, we propose the hybrid hypergraph
network (HHN), a novel framework that models temporal multimodal data via a
segmentation-first, graph-later strategy. HHN splits sequences into timestamped
segments as nodes in a heterogeneous graph. Intra-modal structures are captured
via hyperedges guided by a maximum entropy difference criterion, enhancing node
heterogeneity and structural discrimination, followed by hypergraph convolution
to extract high-order dependencies. Inter-modal links are established through
temporal alignment and graph attention for semantic fusion. HHN achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on four multimodal datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness in complex classification tasks.

*M. Ontivero-Ortega,A. Fania,A. Lacalamita,R. Bellotti,A. Monaco,S. Stramaglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an adaptive version of LOCO (Hi-Fi) to quantify cooperative effects in feature importance for XAI, assigning unique, redundant, and synergistic scores to features. It compares this with Shapley effects and applies it to study air pollutants' relation to Alzheimer's disease mortality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle high-order cooperative effects in feature importance for regression problems, improving explainability in AI.

Method: Proposes a framework to assign unique, redundant, and synergistic scores to features, comparing it with Shapley effects. Applied to air pollutants and Alzheimer's disease mortality.

Result: Identifies synergistic associations between pollutants (O3, NO2) and mortality, and urban green areas' influence. Highlights Bergamo and Brescia as key regions.

Conclusion: Hi-Fi is a promising tool for XAI and analyzing high-order relationships in complex systems, with wide applicability.

Abstract: Leveraging recent advances in the analysis of synergy and redundancy in
systems of random variables, an adaptive version of the widely used metric
Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO) has been recently proposed to quantify
cooperative effects in feature importance (Hi-Fi), a key technique in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), so as to disentangle high-order
effects involving a particular input feature in regression problems.
Differently from standard feature importance tools, where a single score
measures the relevance of each feature, each feature is here characterized by
three scores, a two-body (unique) score and higher-order scores (redundant and
synergistic). This paper presents a framework to assign those three scores
(unique, redundant, and synergistic) to each individual pattern of the data
set, while comparing it with the well-known measure of feature importance named
{\it Shapley effect}. To illustrate the potential of the proposed framework, we
focus on a One-Health application: the relation between air pollutants and
Alzheimer's disease mortality rate. Our main result is the synergistic
association between features related to $O_3$ and $NO_2$ with mortality,
especially in the provinces of Bergamo e Brescia; notably also the density of
urban green areas displays synergistic influence with pollutants for the
prediction of AD mortality. Our results place local Hi-Fi as a promising tool
of wide applicability, which opens new perspectives for XAI as well as to
analyze high-order relationships in complex systems.

TL;DR: Proposes OKG-LLM, a framework integrating Ocean Knowledge Graph with LLMs for improved SST prediction, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SST prediction methods lack integration of domain knowledge, limiting accuracy. LLMs' potential for such integration is underexplored.

Method: Constructs an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG), uses graph embedding to learn semantic/structural knowledge, and fuses it with numerical SST data via a pre-trained LLM.

Result: OKG-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in SST prediction, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: OKG-LLM advances SST prediction by integrating domain knowledge and numerical data, offering a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) prediction is a critical task in ocean science,
supporting various applications, such as weather forecasting, fisheries
management, and storm tracking. While existing data-driven methods have
demonstrated significant success, they often neglect to leverage the rich
domain knowledge accumulated over the past decades, limiting further
advancements in prediction accuracy. The recent emergence of large language
models (LLMs) has highlighted the potential of integrating domain knowledge for
downstream tasks. However, the application of LLMs to SST prediction remains
underexplored, primarily due to the challenge of integrating ocean domain
knowledge and numerical data. To address this issue, we propose Ocean Knowledge
Graph-enhanced LLM (OKG-LLM), a novel framework for global SST prediction. To
the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first systematic effort to
construct an Ocean Knowledge Graph (OKG) specifically designed to represent
diverse ocean knowledge for SST prediction. We then develop a graph embedding
network to learn the comprehensive semantic and structural knowledge within the
OKG, capturing both the unique characteristics of individual sea regions and
the complex correlations between them. Finally, we align and fuse the learned
knowledge with fine-grained numerical SST data and leverage a pre-trained LLM
to model SST patterns for accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the
real-world dataset demonstrate that OKG-LLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness, robustness, and
potential to advance SST prediction. The codes are available in the online
repository.

TL;DR: FeatureCuts is a novel feature selection algorithm that outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving higher feature reduction and lower computation time while maintaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve feature selection in machine learning by adaptively selecting optimal feature cutoffs, enhancing efficiency and scalability for large datasets.

Method: FeatureCuts combines filter ranking with adaptive cutoff selection, evaluated on 15 datasets, and integrates with wrapper methods like PSO.

Result: Achieves 15% more feature reduction, 99.6% less computation time, and maintains performance. With PSO, it enables 25% more reduction and 66% less time.

Conclusion: FeatureCuts is scalable, efficient, and effective for large datasets, outperforming existing methods in feature selection.

Abstract: In machine learning, the process of feature selection involves finding a
reduced subset of features that captures most of the information required to
train an accurate and efficient model. This work presents FeatureCuts, a novel
feature selection algorithm that adaptively selects the optimal feature cutoff
after performing filter ranking. Evaluated on 14 publicly available datasets
and one industry dataset, FeatureCuts achieved, on average, 15 percentage
points more feature reduction and up to 99.6% less computation time while
maintaining model performance, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
When the selected features are used in a wrapper method such as Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO), it enables 25 percentage points more feature reduction,
requires 66% less computation time, and maintains model performance when
compared to PSO alone. The minimal overhead of FeatureCuts makes it scalable
for large datasets typically seen in enterprise applications.

*Yeong-Joon Ju,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient framework for universal multimodal embeddings using hierarchical prompts and self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving state-of-the-art performance without contrastive pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting generative MLLMs for discriminative representation learning is challenging; current contrastive pre-training is inefficient and costly.

Method: Uses a hierarchical embedding prompt template and self-aware hard negative sampling to refine representations and fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves competitive zero-shot performance and boosts fine-tuning by 4.8 points on MMEB, setting state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Offers an efficient pathway for MLLM adaptation, reducing training time while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising solution
for universal embedding tasks, yet adapting their generative nature for
discriminative representation learning remains a significant challenge. The
dominant paradigm of large-scale contrastive pre-training suffers from critical
inefficiencies, including prohibitive computational costs and a failure to
leverage the intrinsic, instruction-following capabilities of MLLMs. To
overcome these limitations, we propose an efficient framework for universal
multimodal embeddings, which bridges this gap by centering on two synergistic
components. First, our hierarchical embedding prompt template employs a
two-level instruction architecture that forces the model to produce
discriminative representations. Building on this strong foundation, our second
component, self-aware hard negative sampling, redefines the fine-tuning process
by leveraging the model's own understanding to efficiently mine challenging
negatives while actively filtering out potential false negatives. Our
comprehensive experiments show that our hierarchical prompt achieves zero-shot
performance competitive with contrastively trained baselines and enhances the
fine-tuning process by lifting a simple in-batch negative baseline by 4.8
points on the MMEB benchmark. We further boost the performance via our
self-aware hard negative sampling, achieving the state-of-the-art performance
without the contrative pre-training. Our work presents an effective and
efficient pathway to adapt MLLMs for universal embedding tasks, significantly
reducing training time.

TL;DR: U^2QT is a novel framework for multi-source user representation learning, addressing limitations of prior late-fusion methods by integrating early fusion and cross-domain knowledge transfer. It uses a two-stage architecture for unified representation and efficient storage, outperforming baselines in tasks like behavior prediction and recommendation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for combining heterogeneous data sources suffer from lack of unified frameworks, scalability issues, and inflexible generalization. U^2QT aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: U^2QT employs a two-stage architecture: 1) a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific features into a shared causal space, and 2) a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes embeddings into compact tokens using shared and source-specific codebooks.

Result: U^2QT outperforms task-specific baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks, achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation.

Conclusion: U^2QT provides a scalable, unified solution for user representation learning, enabling seamless integration with language models and industrial applications.

Abstract: Multi-source user representation learning plays a critical role in enabling
personalized services on web platforms (e.g., Alipay). While prior works have
adopted late-fusion strategies to combine heterogeneous data sources, they
suffer from three key limitations: lack of unified representation frameworks,
scalability and storage issues in data compression, and inflexible cross-task
generalization. To address these challenges, we propose U^2QT (Unified User
Quantized Tokenizers), a novel framework that integrates cross-domain knowledge
transfer with early fusion of heterogeneous domains. Our framework employs a
two-stage architecture: first, a causal Q-Former projects domain-specific
features into a shared causal representation space to preserve inter-modality
dependencies; second, a multi-view RQ-VAE discretizes causal embeddings into
compact tokens through shared and source-specific codebooks, enabling efficient
storage while maintaining semantic coherence. Experimental results showcase
U^2QT's advantages across diverse downstream tasks, outperforming task-specific
baselines in future behavior prediction and recommendation tasks while
achieving efficiency gains in storage and computation. The unified tokenization
framework enables seamless integration with language models and supports
industrial-scale applications.

TL;DR: A framework combining iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and active learning improves zero-shot text classification in dynamic domains with evolving knowledge and ambiguous categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot classification is challenging in domains like ticketing systems due to evolving knowledge and ambiguous categories. LLMs struggle with generalization, and few-shot methods lack data diversity.

Method: The framework uses iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and active learning. It starts with labeled samples, refines categories via contrastive prompting, and includes human-in-the-loop updates for new categories.

Result: Achieves 91% accuracy on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with minimal accuracy drop for unseen classes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enables fine-grained classification with limited supervision, leveraging prompt-based semantic reasoning for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhanced PGNNIV framework improves scalability for high-dimensional data using reduced-order modeling, transfer learning, and noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability challenges in PGNNIV models for high-dimensional data like spatial fields or time-evolving systems.

Method: Introduces surrogate decoders (spectral decomposition, POD, pretrained autoencoders) and integrates transfer learning for model reuse.

Result: Successfully identifies constitutive state equations, maintains accuracy, improves noise robustness, and reduces computational demands.

Conclusion: Proposed techniques overcome scalability issues, adaptable to various scenarios based on data and resources.

Abstract: Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables are SciML tools
that use only observable data for training and and have the capacity to unravel
internal state relations. They incorporate physical knowledge both by
prescribing the model architecture and using loss regularization, thus endowing
certain specific neurons with a physical meaning as internal state variables.
Despite their potential, these models face challenges in scalability when
applied to high-dimensional data such as fine-grid spatial fields or
time-evolving systems. In this work, we propose some enhancements to the PGNNIV
framework that address these scalability limitations through reduced-order
modeling techniques. Specifically, we introduce alternatives to the original
decoder structure using spectral decomposition, POD, and pretrained
autoencoder-based mappings. These surrogate decoders offer varying trade-offs
between computational efficiency, accuracy, noise tolerance, and
generalization, while improving drastically the scalability. Additionally, we
integrate model reuse via transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to
exploit previously acquired knowledge, supporting efficient adaptation to novel
materials or configurations, and significantly reducing training time while
maintaining or improving model performance. To illustrate these various
techniques, we use a representative case governed by the nonlinear diffusion
equation, using only observable data. Results demonstrate that the enhanced
PGNNIV framework successfully identifies the underlying constitutive state
equations while maintaining high predictive accuracy. It also improves
robustness to noise, mitigates overfitting, and reduces computational demands.
The proposed techniques can be tailored to various scenarios depending on data
availability, resources, and specific modeling objectives, overcoming
scalability challenges in all the scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy efficiency in large-scale machine learning is a critical challenge, especially for training and inferencing with large neural networks.

Method: The paper proposes phantom parallelism, deriving new forward and backward propagation operators, implementing them in a custom autograd pipeline, and comparing performance and energy efficiency against traditional tensor parallelism.

Result: Experiments show ~50% energy reduction in training feed-forward networks and the ability to train smaller models on fewer GPUs with comparable results.

Conclusion: Phantom parallelism offers significant energy savings and efficiency improvements over traditional tensor parallelism, making it a promising approach for sustainable large-scale machine learning.

Abstract: Energy efficiency of training and inferencing with large neural network
models is a critical challenge facing the future of sustainable large-scale
machine learning workloads. This paper introduces an alternative strategy,
called phantom parallelism, to minimize the net energy consumption of
traditional tensor (model) parallelism, the most energy-inefficient component
of large neural network training. The approach is presented in the context of
feed-forward network architectures as a preliminary, but comprehensive,
proof-of-principle study of the proposed methodology. We derive new forward and
backward propagation operators for phantom parallelism, implement them as
custom autograd operations within an end-to-end phantom parallel training
pipeline and compare its parallel performance and energy-efficiency against
those of conventional tensor parallel training pipelines. Formal analyses that
predict lower bandwidth and FLOP counts are presented with supporting empirical
results on up to 256 GPUs that corroborate these gains. Experiments are shown
to deliver ~50% reduction in the energy consumed to train FFNs using the
proposed phantom parallel approach when compared with conventional tensor
parallel methods. Additionally, the proposed approach is shown to train smaller
phantom models to the same model loss on smaller GPU counts as larger tensor
parallel models on larger GPU counts offering the possibility for even greater
energy savings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual investors struggle with overwhelming information and lack professional analysis. Equity reports are valuable but underutilized due to slow updates and unstructured formats.

Method: The authors propose FinKario, a dataset with structured financial insights, and FinKario-RAG, a retrieval strategy for real-time data integration.

Result: FinKario with FinKario-RAG outperforms financial LLMs by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% in stock trend prediction.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges the gap between real-time market data and LLMs, improving financial analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: Individual investors are significantly outnumbered and disadvantaged in
financial markets, overwhelmed by abundant information and lacking professional
analysis. Equity research reports stand out as crucial resources, offering
valuable insights. By leveraging these reports, large language models (LLMs)
can enhance investors' decision-making capabilities and strengthen financial
analysis. However, two key challenges limit their effectiveness: (1) the rapid
evolution of market events often outpaces the slow update cycles of existing
knowledge bases, (2) the long-form and unstructured nature of financial reports
further hinders timely and context-aware integration by LLMs. To address these
challenges, we tackle both data and methodological aspects. First, we introduce
the Event-Enhanced Automated Construction of Financial Knowledge Graph
(FinKario), a dataset comprising over 305,360 entities, 9,625 relational
triples, and 19 distinct relation types. FinKario automatically integrates
real-time company fundamentals and market events through prompt-driven
extraction guided by professional institutional templates, providing structured
and accessible financial insights for LLMs. Additionally, we propose a
Two-Stage, Graph-Based retrieval strategy (FinKario-RAG), optimizing the
retrieval of evolving, large-scale financial knowledge to ensure efficient and
precise data access. Extensive experiments show that FinKario with FinKario-RAG
achieves superior stock trend prediction accuracy, outperforming financial LLMs
by 18.81% and institutional strategies by 17.85% on average in backtesting.

### [446] [Rethinking Multimodality: Optimizing Multimodal Deep Learning for Biomedical Signal Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00963)
*Timothy Oladunni,Alex Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study shows that in multimodal deep learning for biomedical signal classification, adding more modalities doesn't always improve performance. Optimal fusion depends on the complementarity of feature domains, not just quantity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the assumption that more modalities always enhance accuracy in biomedical signal classification and to identify the conditions under which multimodal fusion is beneficial.

Method: Five deep learning models (three unimodal and two multimodal) were designed and evaluated for ECG classification, using bootstrapping and Bayesian inference to analyze performance.

Result: Hybrid 1 (fusing time and time-frequency domains) outperformed the baseline, while Hybrid 2 (adding frequency) showed no improvement, indicating redundancy.

Conclusion: Optimal multimodal performance depends on the intrinsic complementarity of domains, not the number of modalities, leading to a new framework for domain fusion.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel perspective on multimodal deep learning for
biomedical signal classification, systematically analyzing how complementary
feature domains impact model performance. While fusing multiple domains often
presumes enhanced accuracy, this work demonstrates that adding modalities can
yield diminishing returns, as not all fusions are inherently advantageous. To
validate this, five deep learning models were designed, developed, and
rigorously evaluated: three unimodal (1D-CNN for time, 2D-CNN for
time-frequency, and 1D-CNN-Transformer for frequency) and two multimodal
(Hybrid 1, which fuses 1D-CNN and 2D-CNN; Hybrid 2, which combines 1D-CNN,
2D-CNN, and a Transformer). For ECG classification, bootstrapping and Bayesian
inference revealed that Hybrid 1 consistently outperformed the 2D-CNN baseline
across all metrics (p-values < 0.05, Bayesian probabilities > 0.90), confirming
the synergistic complementarity of the time and time-frequency domains.
Conversely, Hybrid 2's inclusion of the frequency domain offered no further
improvement and sometimes a marginal decline, indicating representational
redundancy; a phenomenon further substantiated by a targeted ablation study.
This research redefines a fundamental principle of multimodal design in
biomedical signal analysis. We demonstrate that optimal domain fusion isn't
about the number of modalities, but the quality of their inherent
complementarity. This paradigm-shifting concept moves beyond purely heuristic
feature selection. Our novel theoretical contribution, "Complementary Feature
Domains in Multimodal ECG Deep Learning," presents a mathematically
quantifiable framework for identifying ideal domain combinations, demonstrating
that optimal multimodal performance arises from the intrinsic
information-theoretic complementarity among fused domains.

*Roie Kazoom,Ofir Cohen,Rami Puzis,Asaf Shabtai,Ofer Hadar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VAULT is an automated adversarial RAG pipeline that improves NLI model robustness through retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining, achieving significant accuracy boosts on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically uncover and remedy weaknesses in NLI models by automating adversarial data curation and retraining.

Method: Uses a three-stage pipeline: balanced few-shot retrieval, adversarial hypothesis generation via LLM prompts, and iterative retraining with validated adversarial examples.

Result: Improves RoBERTa-base accuracy by up to +17.32% on benchmarks (SNLI, ANLI, MultiNLI) and outperforms prior methods by up to 2.0%.

Conclusion: VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI tasks by automating adversarial data curation at scale.

Abstract: We introduce VAULT, a fully automated adversarial RAG pipeline that
systematically uncovers and remedies weaknesses in NLI models through three
stages: retrieval, adversarial generation, and iterative retraining. First, we
perform balanced few-shot retrieval by embedding premises with both semantic
(BGE) and lexical (BM25) similarity. Next, we assemble these contexts into LLM
prompts to generate adversarial hypotheses, which are then validated by an LLM
ensemble for label fidelity. Finally, the validated adversarial examples are
injected back into the training set at increasing mixing ratios, progressively
fortifying a zero-shot RoBERTa-base model.On standard benchmarks, VAULT
elevates RoBERTa-base accuracy from 88.48% to 92.60% on SNLI +4.12%, from
75.04% to 80.95% on ANLI +5.91%, and from 54.67% to 71.99% on MultiNLI +17.32%.
It also consistently outperforms prior in-context adversarial methods by up to
2.0% across datasets. By automating high-quality adversarial data curation at
scale, VAULT enables rapid, human-independent robustness improvements in NLI
inference tasks.

### [448] [Masked Omics Modeling for Multimodal Representation Learning across Histopathology and Molecular Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00969)
*Lucas Robinet,Ahmad Berjaoui,Elizabeth Cohen-Jonathan Moyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MORPHEUS is a transformer-based framework that integrates histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space, outperforming existing methods in oncology tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Histopathology alone lacks molecular and clinical insights, which multi-omics data can provide. MORPHEUS aims to bridge this gap by learning cross-modal relationships.

Method: Uses masked modeling to pre-train on histopathology and omics data, enabling flexible input combinations and any-to-any omics generation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods across tasks and modality combinations, demonstrating robust performance.

Conclusion: MORPHEUS is a versatile and powerful framework for multimodal foundation models in oncology.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has driven major advances in computational pathology
by enabling models to learn rich representations from hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained cancer tissue. However, histopathology alone often falls short
for molecular characterization and understanding clinical outcomes, as
important information is contained in high-dimensional omics profiles like
transcriptomics, methylomics, or genomics. In this work, we introduce MORPHEUS,
a unified transformer-based pre-training framework that encodes both
histopathology and multi-omics data into a shared latent space. At its core,
MORPHEUS relies on a masked modeling objective applied to randomly selected
omics portions, encouraging the model to learn biologically meaningful
cross-modal relationships. The same pre-trained network can be applied to
histopathology alone or in combination with any subset of omics modalities,
seamlessly adapting to the available inputs. Additionally, MORPHEUS enables
any-to-any omics generation, enabling one or more omics profiles to be inferred
from any subset of modalities, including H&E alone. Pre-trained on a large
pan-cancer cohort, MORPHEUS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across diverse modality combinations and tasks, positioning itself as a
promising framework for developing multimodal foundation models in oncology.

*Agrim Bari,Parikshit Hegde,Gustavo de Veciana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses efficient routing and scheduling in LLM inference systems, proposing the RAD and SLAI schedulers to optimize throughput and meet SLOs like TBT and TTFT constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing use of LLM-based tools necessitates efficient inference systems due to their unique two-phase computation structure (prefill and decode phases).

Method: Develops a theoretical framework for routing and scheduling, introduces the RAD scheduler for throughput optimality, and designs the SLAI scheduler to prioritize decode requests and reduce TTFT delays.

Result: Evaluation on Mistral-7B shows SLAI reduces median TTFT by 53% and increases serving capacity by 26% while meeting TBT constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed schedulers (RAD and SLAI) effectively optimize LLM inference systems, improving throughput and meeting practical SLOs.

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini across industries, there is a rising need for efficient
LLM inference systems. These systems handle requests with a unique two-phase
computation structure: a prefill-phase that processes the full input prompt and
a decode-phase that autoregressively generates tokens one at a time. This
structure calls for new strategies for routing and scheduling requests.
  In this paper, we take a comprehensive approach to this challenge by
developing a theoretical framework that models routing and scheduling in LLM
inference systems. We identify two key design principles-optimal tiling and
dynamic resource allocation-that are essential for achieving high throughput.
Guided by these principles, we propose the Resource-Aware Dynamic (RAD)
scheduler and prove that it achieves throughput optimality under mild
conditions. To address practical Service Level Objectives (SLOs) such as
serving requests with different Time Between Token (TBT) constraints, we design
the SLO-Aware LLM Inference (SLAI) scheduler. SLAI uses real-time measurements
to prioritize decode requests that are close to missing their TBT deadlines and
reorders prefill requests based on known prompt lengths to further reduce the
Time To First Token (TTFT) delays.
  We evaluate SLAI on the Openchat ShareGPT4 dataset using the Mistral-7B model
on an NVIDIA RTX ADA 6000 GPU. Compared to Sarathi-Serve, SLAI reduces the
median TTFT by 53% and increases the maximum serving capacity by 26% such that
median TTFT is below 0.5 seconds, while meeting tail TBT latency constraints.

*Gnankan Landry Regis N'guessan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: v-PuNNs introduce p-adic neural networks for hierarchical data, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with interpretable, ultrametric representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean space is unsuitable for hierarchical data like taxa or word senses, prompting the need for a specialized architecture.

Method: v-PuNNs use p-adic balls and TURL for subtree semantics, with VAPO optimization for training.

Result: Achieves 99.96% accuracy on WordNet, 96.9% on GO, and -0.96 Spearman ρ on NCBI Mammalia, with perfect ultrametric properties.

Conclusion: v-PuNNs bridge number theory and deep learning, providing exact, interpretable models for hierarchical data.

Abstract: Conventional deep learning models embed data in Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$, a poor fit for strictly hierarchical objects such as taxa, word
senses, or file systems. We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs),
the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic
balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation
Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact
subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a
depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents
any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose
Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic
variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three
canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art:
WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO
molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $\rho
= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly
ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and
information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive
structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative
codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and
deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for
hierarchical data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a proximity-based acquisition strategy for multi-fidelity optimization using Gaussian Processes, simplifying fidelity selection and enabling multi-fidelity UCB strategies. It benchmarks these methods, showing consistent control over high-fidelity usage and efficient convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Gaussian Process-based multi-fidelity optimization by reducing reliance on expensive high-fidelity evaluations and simplifying fidelity selection.

Method: Proximity-based acquisition strategy and multi-fidelity UCB strategies combined with multi-fidelity GPs. Benchmarked against other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies.

Result: Proximity-based strategy provides consistent control over high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed methods advance multi-fidelity optimization, demonstrating effectiveness in tasks like chemical kinetic modeling.

Abstract: Multi-fidelity optimization employs surrogate models that integrate
information from varying levels of fidelity to guide efficient exploration of
complex design spaces while minimizing the reliance on (expensive)
high-fidelity objective function evaluations. To advance Gaussian Process
(GP)-based multi-fidelity optimization, we implement a proximity-based
acquisition strategy that simplifies fidelity selection by eliminating the need
for separate acquisition functions at each fidelity level. We also enable
multi-fidelity Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) strategies by combining them with
multi-fidelity GPs rather than the standard GPs typically used. We benchmark
these approaches alongside other multi-fidelity acquisition strategies
(including fidelity-weighted approaches) comparing their performance, reliance
on high-fidelity evaluations, and hyperparameter tunability in representative
optimization tasks. The results highlight the capability of the proximity-based
multi-fidelity acquisition function to deliver consistent control over
high-fidelity usage while maintaining convergence efficiency. Our illustrative
examples include multi-fidelity chemical kinetic models, both homogeneous and
heterogeneous (dynamic catalysis for ammonia production).

*Jesse He,Akbar Rafiey,Gal Mishne,Yusu Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes GNN explanation methods, comparing input-level and layerwise explanations, and establishes theoretical connections between perturbation-based and gradient-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for a deeper theoretical understanding of GNN explanation methods due to inconsistent performance across architectures and tasks.

Method: Theoretical analysis of GNN explanations in input-level and layerwise settings, connecting perturbation-based and gradient-based methods, and validating with experiments.

Result: Conditions for approximating GNNExplainer with edge gradient signs and equivalence of edge gradients to occlusion search in linear GNNs.

Conclusion: Theoretical insights bridge gaps between GNN explanation methods, validated by practical experiments.

Abstract: In recent years, the remarkable success of graph neural networks (GNNs) on
graph-structured data has prompted a surge of methods for explaining GNN
predictions. However, the state-of-the-art for GNN explainability remains in
flux. Different comparisons find mixed results for different methods, with many
explainers struggling on more complex GNN architectures and tasks. This
presents an urgent need for a more careful theoretical analysis of competing
GNN explanation methods. In this work we take a closer look at GNN explanations
in two different settings: input-level explanations, which produce explanatory
subgraphs of the input graph, and layerwise explanations, which produce
explanatory subgraphs of the computation graph. We establish the first
theoretical connections between the popular perturbation-based and classical
gradient-based methods, as well as point out connections between other recently
proposed methods. At the input level, we demonstrate conditions under which
GNNExplainer can be approximated by a simple heuristic based on the sign of the
edge gradients. In the layerwise setting, we point out that edge gradients are
equivalent to occlusion search for linear GNNs. Finally, we demonstrate how our
theoretical results manifest in practice with experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error in MARL by adaptive action sampling, improving convergence to optimal policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent policy gradients in MARL can lead to suboptimal convergence due to sampling errors, even when gradients point optimally.

Method: Introduces MA-PROPS, an adaptive action sampling method using a centralized behavior policy to reduce joint sampling error.

Result: MA-PROPS efficiently reduces sampling error and improves convergence reliability in diverse multi-agent games.

Conclusion: Coordinated action selection via MA-PROPS enhances policy gradient learning in MARL by mitigating sampling errors.

Abstract: Independent on-policy policy gradient algorithms are widely used for
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in cooperative and no-conflict games,
but they are known to converge suboptimally when each agent's policy gradient
points toward a suboptimal equilibrium. In this work, we identify a subtler
failure mode that arises \textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all
agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of
trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint
data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution.
This \textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces
inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In
this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through
coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of
policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive
action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method,
Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized
behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint
actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We
empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and
demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently
than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of
independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training
runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.

TL;DR: FGBench introduces a dataset with 625K molecular property reasoning problems, incorporating fine-grained functional group (FG) information to enhance LLMs' interpretability and reasoning in chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack FG-level data, which is crucial for linking molecular structures with textual descriptions and improving LLMs' reasoning in chemistry.

Method: FGBench provides annotated FG data for 245 functional groups across three reasoning tasks: single FG impacts, multiple FG interactions, and direct molecular comparisons.

Result: Benchmarking shows current LLMs struggle with FG-level reasoning, indicating a need for improved capabilities.

Conclusion: FGBench's methodology can guide future dataset creation, helping LLMs better understand molecular structure-property relationships.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry.
However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction
and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information.
Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links
molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more
interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks.
Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden
relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties,
thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce
FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with
functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and
localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability
thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both
regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across
three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group
impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular
comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the
results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning,
highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry
tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct
datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational
framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better
understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset

Conclusion: The findings suggest leveraging lattice basis reduction techniques to enhance quantization methods in neural networks.

Abstract: We explain how data-driven quantization of a linear unit in a neural network
corresponds to solving the closest vector problem for a certain lattice
generated by input data. We prove that the GPTQ algorithm is equivalent to
Babai's well-known nearest-plane algorithm. We furthermore provide geometric
intuition for both algorithms. Lastly, we note the consequences of these
results, in particular hinting at the possibility for using lattice basis
reduction for better quantization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for probabilistic forecasting in dynamical systems using flow matching and generative ML to handle ill-posed problems and non-Gaussian variables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in learning dynamical systems with missing variables and noisy data, where classical models fail due to ill-posedness.

Method: Introduces flow matching for probabilistic forecasting and a generative ML approach for state perturbation, validated on high-dimensional systems like WeatherBench.

Result: Effective modeling of uncertainty and plausible outcomes in complex dynamical systems, demonstrated on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully handles ill-posed problems and non-Gaussian behaviors, offering robust probabilistic forecasting for dynamical systems.

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems is crucial across many fields, yet applying
machine learning techniques remains challenging due to missing variables and
noisy data. Classical mathematical models often struggle in these scenarios due
to the arose ill-posedness of the physical systems. Stochastic machine learning
techniques address this challenge by enabling the modeling of such ill-posed
problems. Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may
yield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct. In such
scenarios, probabilistic forecasting is inherently meaningful. In this study,
we introduce a variant of flow matching for probabilistic forecasting which
estimates possible future states as a distribution over possible outcomes
rather than a single-point prediction. Perturbation of complex dynamical states
is not trivial. Community uses typical Gaussian or uniform perturbations to
crucial variables to model uncertainty. However, not all variables behave in a
Gaussian fashion. So, we also propose a generative machine learning approach to
physically and logically perturb the states of complex high-dimensional
dynamical systems. Finally, we establish the mathematical foundations of our
method and demonstrate its effectiveness on several challenging dynamical
systems, including a variant of the high-dimensional WeatherBench dataset,
which models the global weather at a 5.625{\deg} meridional resolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of subjective and periodic stress assessments in students by leveraging data-driven methods for timely intervention.

Result: Achieved 93.09% accuracy with weighted hard voting on one dataset and 99.53% with stacking on another, surpassing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the potential of data-driven systems for early stress detection in academic settings.

Abstract: Student mental health is an increasing concern in academic institutions,
where stress can severely impact well-being and academic performance.
Traditional assessment methods rely on subjective surveys and periodic
evaluations, offering limited value for timely intervention. This paper
introduces a context-aware machine learning framework for classifying student
stress using two complementary survey-based datasets covering psychological,
academic, environmental, and social factors. The framework follows a six-stage
pipeline involving preprocessing, feature selection (SelectKBest, RFECV),
dimensionality reduction (PCA), and training with six base classifiers: SVM,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Bagging. To enhance
performance, we implement ensemble strategies, including hard voting, soft
voting, weighted voting, and stacking. Our best models achieve 93.09% accuracy
with weighted hard voting on the Student Stress Factors dataset and 99.53% with
stacking on the Stress and Well-being dataset, surpassing previous benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of context-integrated, data-driven
systems for early stress detection and underscore their applicability in
real-world academic settings to support student well-being.

TL;DR: BUS is a tree-based method for user segmentation using behavioral data, improving recommendation quality and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance recommendation systems by addressing cold-start issues and improving user experience, especially for new or infrequent users.

Method: Hierarchical segmentation using NDCG as the objective, integrating social graphs for fairness, and combining behavioral patterns.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in ranking quality and improves online metrics like music ranking and email notifications.

Conclusion: BUS is a scalable, interpretable framework for integrating user attributes in recommendations, validated in large-scale production.

Abstract: User attributes are essential in multiple stages of modern recommendation
systems and are particularly important for mitigating the cold-start problem
and improving the experience of new or infrequent users. We propose
Behavior-based User Segmentation (BUS), a novel tree-based data structure that
hierarchically segments the user universe with various users' categorical
attributes based on the users' product-specific engagement behaviors. During
the BUS tree construction, we use Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)
as the objective function to maximize the behavioral representativeness of
marginal users relative to active users in the same segment. The constructed
BUS tree undergoes further processing and aggregation across the leaf nodes and
internal nodes, allowing the generation of popular social content and
behavioral patterns for each node in the tree. To further mitigate bias and
improve fairness, we use the social graph to derive the user's connection-based
BUS segments, enabling the combination of behavioral patterns extracted from
both the user's own segment and connection-based segments as the connection
aware BUS-based recommendation. Our offline analysis shows that the BUS-based
retrieval significantly outperforms traditional user cohort-based aggregation
on ranking quality. We have successfully deployed our data structure and
machine learning algorithm and tested it with various production traffic
serving billions of users daily, achieving statistically significant
improvements in the online product metrics, including music ranking and email
notifications. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first
list-wise learning-to-rank framework for tree-based recommendation that
effectively integrates diverse user categorical attributes while preserving
real-world semantic interpretability at a large industrial scale.

TL;DR: The paper explores using decoder-only Transformer models to generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers (PRNGs), demonstrating their ability to simulate LCG and MT PRNGs and pass NIST tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRNGs are crucial for optimizing large language models, and Transformers' nonlinear processing capabilities make them suitable for generating high-quality random numbers.

Method: Theoretical analysis and experiments are conducted to show decoder-only Transformers with Chain-of-Thought can simulate LCG and MT PRNGs.

Result: Transformer-based PRNGs pass NIST tests, showing statistical randomness, and are evaluated for prediction attacks.

Conclusion: Transformers can effectively simulate PRNGs, offering potential benefits for applications requiring high-quality randomness.

Abstract: Pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) are high-nonlinear processes, and
they are key blocks in optimization of Large language models. Transformers
excel at processing complex nonlinear relationships. Thus it is reasonable to
generate high-quality pseudo-random numbers based on transformers. In this
paper, we explore this question from both theoretical and practical
perspectives, highlighting the potential benefits and implications of
Transformer in PRNGs. We theoretically demonstrate that decoder-only
Transformer models with Chain-of-Thought can simulate both the Linear
Congruential Generator (LCG) and Mersenne Twister (MT) PRNGs. Based on this, we
conclude that the log-precision decoder-only Transformer can represent
non-uniform $\text{AC}^0$. Our simulative theoretical findings are validated
through experiments. The random numbers generated by Transformer-based PRNGs
successfully pass the majority of NIST tests, whose heat maps exhibit clear
statistical randomness. Finally, we assess their capability in prediction
attacks.

Method: Proposes DisTaC, which uses knowledge distillation to adjust task vector norms and boost source-model confidence before merging.

Result: DisTaC enables successful merging of models with harmful traits, achieving significant performance gains.

Conclusion: DisTaC effectively pre-conditions task vectors, enhancing the robustness of model-merging techniques.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient and flexible paradigm for
multi-task learning, with numerous methods being proposed in recent years.
However, these state-of-the-art techniques are typically evaluated on benchmark
suites that are highly favorable to model merging, and their robustness in more
realistic settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we first
investigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the
source-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we
identify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)
disparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source
models. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector
Conditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task
vectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a
task vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its
essential task-specific knowledge. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that
by pre-conditioning task vectors with DisTaC, state-of-the-art merging
techniques can successfully integrate models exhibiting the harmful traits --
where they would otherwise fail -- achieving significant performance gains.

### [461] [T2S: Tokenized Skill Scaling for Lifelong Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01167)
*Hongquan Zhang,Jingyu Gong,Zhizhong Zhang,Xin Tan,Yanyun Qu,Yuan Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2S is a unified framework for lifelong imitation learning that balances skill retention and acquisition by tokenizing model parameters and using cross-attention, achieving strong results in preventing forgetting and scaling new skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge is balancing catastrophic forgetting and new skill acquisition in lifelong imitation learning, which current methods address in isolation.

Method: Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S) tokenizes model parameters, transforming linear mappings into cross-attention for scalability. It also uses language-guided skill scaling for efficient knowledge transfer.

Result: T2S prevents catastrophic forgetting (1.0% NBT), scales new skills with minimal parameter growth (8.0% trainable tokens), and enables efficient knowledge transfer (77.7% FWT).

Conclusion: T2S offers a promising solution for lifelong imitation learning by unifying skill retention and acquisition.

Abstract: The main challenge in lifelong imitation learning lies in the balance between
mitigating catastrophic forgetting of previous skills while maintaining
sufficient capacity for acquiring new ones. However, current approaches
typically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal
correlation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a
unified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by
tokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the
traditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and
learnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy
extension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill
scaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly
growing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that
T2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT
of 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling
with minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable
tokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge
transfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three
LIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation
learning.

*Jiayi Chen,Jing Li,Guiling Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARS is a multi-agent RL framework for portfolio management, balancing risk and return by dynamically orchestrating agents with diverse risk profiles via a Meta-Adaptive Controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL models struggle to adapt to changing market conditions and balance risk-return trade-offs effectively.

Method: Uses a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble with unique risk profiles, enforced by Safety-Critic networks and a Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) to adjust agent reliance.

Result: Reduces maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining competitive returns, tested on international stock indexes.

Conclusion: MARS provides a robust, adaptive solution for portfolio management by leveraging behavioral diversity, outperforming traditional methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated
portfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a
central challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market
conditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware
System (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this
limitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single
monolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent
possesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a
dedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,
allowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to
aggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level
Meta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.
By adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC
effectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher
returns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall
stability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and
adaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework
achieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral
diversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major
international stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,
demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,
significantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining
competitive returns.

*Kaichen Zhang,Shenghao Gao,Yuzhong Hong,Haipeng Sun,Junwei Bao,Hongfei Jiang,Yang Song,Hong Dingqian,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSPO optimizes risk-seeking metrics (Pass@k, Max@k) directly, addressing the 'hitchhiking' problem with efficient gradient estimators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models optimize risk-neutral objectives but are evaluated with risk-seeking metrics, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: RSPO leverages closed-form probabilities to avoid reinforcing low-reward responses and provides unbiased gradient estimators.

Result: Theoretical and experimental validation confirms RSPO's effectiveness in optimizing risk-seeking metrics.

Conclusion: RSPO bridges the gap between training objectives and evaluation metrics, improving performance for risk-seeking tasks.

Abstract: Current large language model post-training optimizes a risk-neutral objective
that maximizes expected reward, yet evaluation relies heavily on risk-seeking
metrics like Pass@k (at least one success in k trials) and Max@k (maximum
reward across k responses). This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably
lead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking
Policy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and
Max@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the
"hitchhiking" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if
they co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,
resulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by
leveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum
among k samplings. Despite the complexity of nested gradients over multiple
responses, RSPO produces efficient, unbiased gradient estimators for both
metrics. We validate our approach with both rigorous theoretical analysis and
comprehensive experimental results.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a sine-wave based activation function, to enhance expressive power and parameter efficiency in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current activation functions like ReLU require large models for complex tasks. PLU aims to improve efficiency and expressive power.

Method: PLU uses periodic non-monotonicity and Repulsive Reparameterization to prevent collapse into linear functions.

Result: A minimal MLP with two PLU neurons solves the spiral classification task, outperforming standard activations.

Conclusion: PLU enables a shift from piecewise approximators to Fourier-like synthesizers, improving parameter efficiency.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple,
monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this
paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate
complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU),
a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is
designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through
its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization,
which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear
function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve
the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using
standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise
Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers,
achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in
the neuron itself.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of fragmented workflows, low efficiency, and poor OOD generalization in existing computational platforms for drug discovery.

Method: BSL integrates seven core tasks in a unified framework using generative models and graph neural networks, with a focus on OOD evaluation.

Result: BSL achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks, identifies three bioactive compounds for GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor, and outperforms existing platforms.

Conclusion: BSL is a comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery, accelerating biomedical research and drug development.

Abstract: Drug discovery is of great social significance in safeguarding human health,
prolonging life, and addressing the challenges of major diseases. In recent
years, artificial intelligence has demonstrated remarkable advantages in key
tasks across bioinformatics and pharmacology, owing to its efficient data
processing and data representation capabilities. However, most existing
computational platforms cover only a subset of core tasks, leading to
fragmented workflows and low efficiency. In addition, they often lack
algorithmic innovation and show poor generalization to out-of-distribution
(OOD) data, which greatly hinders the progress of drug discovery. To address
these limitations, we propose Baishenglai (BSL), a deep learning-enhanced,
open-access platform designed for virtual drug discovery. BSL integrates seven
core tasks within a unified and modular framework, incorporating advanced
technologies such as generative models and graph neural networks. In addition
to achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark
datasets, the platform emphasizes evaluation mechanisms that focus on
generalization to OOD molecular structures. Comparative experiments with
existing platforms and baseline methods demonstrate that BSL provides a
comprehensive, scalable, and effective solution for virtual drug discovery,
offering both algorithmic innovation and high-precision prediction for
real-world pharmaceutical research. In addition, BSL demonstrated its practical
utility by discovering novel modulators of the GluN1/GluN3A NMDA receptor,
successfully identifying three compounds with clear bioactivity in in-vitro
electrophysiological assays. These results highlight BSL as a promising and
comprehensive platform for accelerating biomedical research and drug discovery.

*Sukwon Yun,Xin Liu,Yunhak Oh,Junseok Lee,Tianlong Chen,Tsuyoshi Murata,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GOODIE is a hybrid framework combining Label Propagation and Feature Propagation to address missing node features in graphs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing node features in real-world graphs degrade GNN performance, especially when few features are available. Existing methods underperform compared to traditional models.

Method: GOODIE integrates Label Propagation and Feature Propagation branches, using a GNN-based decoder and Structure-Feature Attention. It employs Pseudo-Label contrastive learning for final predictions.

Result: GOODIE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in scenarios with few or abundant features.

Conclusion: GOODIE effectively leverages structure and feature information, offering robust performance in feature-missing scenarios.

Abstract: In real-world graphs, we often encounter missing feature situations where a
few or the majority of node features, e.g., sensitive information, are missed.
In such scenarios, directly utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) would yield
sub-optimal results in downstream tasks such as node classification. Despite
the emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing
situation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse
than traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel
framework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation
(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a
partial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach
to obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation
branch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label
Propagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP
branch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and
feature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.
Followed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the
contribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP
branch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few
features are available but also in abundantly available situations. Source code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MOFS is a multimodal framework for few-shot learning of PDE operators, outperforming existing methods by integrating self-supervised pretraining, text-conditioned embeddings, and memory-augmented prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural operator methods lack generalization across PDE families and require abundant data for each PDE. MOFS aims to address this by enabling few-shot learning for unseen PDE operators.

Method: MOFS combines multi-task self-supervised pretraining, text-conditioned operator embeddings, and memory-augmented multimodal prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal attention. It uses a two-stage training paradigm.

Result: MOFS outperforms baselines in few-shot generalization on PDE benchmarks like Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants. Ablations confirm the importance of each modality and component.

Conclusion: MOFS provides a universal, data-efficient foundation for learning PDE operators across scientific domains.

Abstract: Learning solution operators for partial differential equations (PDEs) has
become a foundational task in scientific machine learning. However, existing
neural operator methods require abundant training data for each specific PDE
and lack the ability to generalize across PDE families. In this work, we
propose MOFS: a unified multimodal framework for multi-operator few-shot
learning, which aims to generalize to unseen PDE operators using only a few
demonstration examples. Our method integrates three key components: (i)
multi-task self-supervised pretraining of a shared Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO) encoder to reconstruct masked spatial fields and predict frequency
spectra, (ii) text-conditioned operator embeddings derived from statistical
summaries of input-output fields, and (iii) memory-augmented multimodal
prompting with gated fusion and cross-modal gradient-based attention. We adopt
a two-stage training paradigm that first learns prompt-conditioned inference on
seen operators and then applies end-to-end contrastive fine-tuning to align
latent representations across vision, frequency, and text modalities.
Experiments on PDE benchmarks, including Darcy Flow and Navier Stokes variants,
demonstrate that our model outperforms existing operator learning baselines in
few-shot generalization. Extensive ablations validate the contributions of each
modality and training component. Our approach offers a new foundation for
universal and data-efficient operator learning across scientific domains.

TL;DR: A novel spatial interpolation pipeline using GNNs and PNA-GPE for reliable spatiotemporal data visualization with uncertainty encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional interpolation methods fail due to limited sensor coverage, necessitating reliable visualization for decision-making.

Method: Integrates GNNs, PNA, and GPE for spatiotemporal learning; introduces static visualization for uncertainty.

Result: Superior performance in data imputation and improved interpolant reliability; effective uncertainty communication.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enhances visualization reliability and uncertainty representation, validated by real-world use cases.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable visualization of spatiotemporal sensor data such as
environmental parameters and meteorological conditions is crucial for informed
decision-making. Traditional spatial interpolation methods, however, often fall
short of producing reliable interpolation results due to the limited and
irregular sensor coverage. This paper introduces a novel spatial interpolation
pipeline that achieves reliable interpolation results and produces a novel
heatmap representation with uncertainty information encoded. We leverage
imputation reference data from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance
visualization reliability and temporal resolution. By integrating Principal
Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA) and Geographical Positional Encoding (GPE), our
model effectively learns the spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
propose an extrinsic, static visualization technique for interpolation-based
heatmaps that effectively communicates the uncertainties arising from various
sources in the interpolated map. Through a set of use cases, extensive
evaluations on real-world datasets, and user studies, we demonstrate our
model's superior performance for data imputation, the improvements to the
interpolant with reference data, and the effectiveness of our visualization
design in communicating uncertainties.

*Hung-Chieh Fang,Hsuan-Tien Lin,Irwin King,Yifei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Soft Separation and Distillation (SSD) to improve global uniformity in Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) by addressing non-IID data challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FUL methods achieve local uniformity but struggle with global uniformity due to non-IID data and decentralization.

Method: Proposes SSD, which encourages client representations to spread in different directions and includes a projector distillation module.

Result: SSD improves representation quality and task performance in cross-silo and cross-device federated settings.

Conclusion: SSD effectively addresses inter-client uniformity in FUL, enhancing global representation quality.

Abstract: Federated Unsupervised Learning (FUL) aims to learn expressive
representations in federated and self-supervised settings. The quality of
representations learned in FUL is usually determined by uniformity, a measure
of how uniformly representations are distributed in the embedding space.
However, existing solutions perform well in achieving intra-client (local)
uniformity for local models while failing to achieve inter-client (global)
uniformity after aggregation due to non-IID data distributions and the
decentralized nature of FUL. To address this issue, we propose Soft Separation
and Distillation (SSD), a novel approach that preserves inter-client uniformity
by encouraging client representations to spread toward different directions.
This design reduces interference during client model aggregation, thereby
improving global uniformity while preserving local representation
expressiveness. We further enhance this effect by introducing a projector
distillation module to address the discrepancy between loss optimization and
representation quality. We evaluate SSD in both cross-silo and cross-device
federated settings, demonstrating consistent improvements in representation
quality and task performance across various training scenarios. Our results
highlight the importance of inter-client uniformity in FUL and establish SSD as
an effective solution to this challenge. Project page:

*Micah Rentschler,Jesse Roberts*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Greedy-trained meta-RL agents can exhibit emergent exploration under specific conditions: recurring environmental structure, agent memory, and long-horizon credit assignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the conventional need for explicit exploration incentives by showing that greedy objectives can naturally lead to exploration under certain conditions.

Method: Train meta-RL agents with a greedy objective and test their exploratory behavior in stochastic bandits and gridworlds, while ablating key conditions.

Result: Emergent exploration occurs when environmental structure and memory are present, but not when either is absent. Long-horizon credit assignment is less critical.

Conclusion: Exploration can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process without explicit incentives, given the right conditions.

Abstract: Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.
Conventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit
incentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained
solely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless
exhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)
Recurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable
regularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent
Memory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;
and (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over
a time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform
current decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and
temporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory
are present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits
information-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through
controlled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either
environmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).
Surprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not
always prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the
pseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right
prerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal
objectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes FedCD, a fairness-aware federated cognitive diagnosis framework, to address privacy and fairness challenges in online education by decoupling model parameters for personalized and global updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The influx of distributed student learning data in online education platforms raises privacy and fairness concerns, especially in cognitive diagnosis (CD). Federated learning (FL) offers a solution but faces data quality issues due to varying student abilities and educational contexts.

Method: FedCD decouples model parameters into locally personalized (for fair diagnosis) and globally shared (for fairness-aware aggregation) parts, training CD models locally without sharing raw data.

Result: Experiments on three real-world datasets show FedCD outperforms five FL approaches under three CD models, ensuring privacy and fairness.

Conclusion: FedCD effectively balances privacy and fairness in cognitive diagnosis, offering a scalable solution for federated learning in education.

Abstract: Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of
distributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities
for cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts
while also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope
with this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by
jointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their
original data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability
differences and educational context differences between different
groups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of
models. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware
federated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models
built upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,
preserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students
on each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the
students in each client based on its local student learning data, and each
client uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter
aggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The
main idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the
first is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic
function-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;
the second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,
containing exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware
aggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD
framework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under
three CD models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GraphVSSM, a probabilistic spatiotemporal framework combining graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference to dynamically assess regional disaster resilience, addressing gaps in physical vulnerability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for assessing physical vulnerability are static and limited. The growth in satellite data and machine learning offers an opportunity to improve dynamic risk assessment.

Method: GraphVSSM integrates graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using time-series data and expert beliefs in a weakly supervised manner.

Result: Demonstrated in Quezon City, cyclone-impacted Bangladesh, and mudslide-affected Sierra Leone; introduced METEOR 2.5D, an enhanced geospatial dataset for UN Least Developed Countries.

Conclusion: GraphVSSM advances disaster resilience assessment, improves global risk reduction understanding, and offers a probabilistic deep learning approach for urban studies.

Abstract: Regional disaster resilience quantifies the changing nature of physical risks
to inform policy instruments ranging from local immediate recovery to
international sustainable development. While many existing state-of-practice
methods have greatly advanced the dynamic mapping of exposure and hazard, our
understanding of large-scale physical vulnerability has remained static,
costly, limited, region-specific, coarse-grained, overly aggregated, and
inadequately calibrated. With the significant growth in the availability of
time-series satellite imagery and derived products for exposure and hazard, we
focus our work on the equally important yet challenging element of the risk
equation: physical vulnerability. We leverage machine learning methods that
flexibly capture spatial contextual relationships, limited temporal
observations, and uncertainty in a unified probabilistic spatiotemporal
inference framework. We therefore introduce Graph Variational State-Space Model
(GraphVSSM), a novel modular spatiotemporal approach that uniquely integrates
graph deep learning, state-space modeling, and variational inference using
time-series data and prior expert belief systems in a weakly supervised or
coarse-to-fine-grained manner. We present three major results: a city-wide
demonstration in Quezon City, Philippines; an investigation of sudden changes
in the cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community (Bangladesh) and
mudslide-affected Freetown (Sierra Leone); and an open geospatial dataset,
METEOR 2.5D, that spatiotemporally enhances the existing global static dataset
for UN Least Developed Countries (2020). Beyond advancing regional disaster
resilience assessment and improving our understanding global disaster risk
reduction progress, our method also offers a probabilistic deep learning
approach, contributing to broader urban studies that require compositional data
analysis in weak supervision.

*Vamsi Sai Krishna Malineni,Suresh Rajendran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PINNs address the challenge of sparse data in engineering by embedding physics into neural networks, focusing on flow reconstruction from sparse datasets in 2D and 3D flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining large datasets for engineering applications is expensive, and existing research lacks focus on sparse data scenarios.

Method: Develops PINN models for 2D laminar and 3D turbulent flows, comparing training methods and relaxing physics constraints.

Result: PINNs effectively reconstruct flow fields from sparse data, even in highly turbulent scenarios.

Conclusion: PINNs show promise for real-world flow reconstruction with limited data, offering computational efficiency.

Abstract: The utilization of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in physical science and
engineering applications has gained traction due to their capacity to learn
intricate functions. While large datasets are crucial for training DNN models
in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, obtaining such
datasets for engineering applications is prohibitively expensive.
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a branch of Physics-Informed Machine
Learning (PIML), tackle this challenge by embedding physical principles within
neural network architectures. PINNs have been extensively explored for solving
diverse forward and inverse problems in fluid mechanics. Nonetheless, there is
limited research on employing PINNs for flow reconstruction from sparse data
under constrained computational resources. Earlier studies were focused on
forward problems with well-defined data. The present study attempts to develop
models capable of reconstructing the flow field data from sparse datasets
mirroring real-world scenarios.
  This study focuses on two cases: (a) two-dimensional (2D) unsteady laminar
flow past a circular cylinder and (b) three-dimensional (3D) unsteady turbulent
flow past an ultra-large container ship (ULCS). The first case compares the
effectiveness of training methods like Standard PINN and Backward Compatible
PINN (BC-PINN) and explores the performance enhancements through systematic
relaxation of physics constraints and dynamic weighting of loss function
components. The second case highlights the capability of PINN-based models to
learn underlying physics from sparse data while accurately reconstructing the

*Christopher Godwin Udomboso,Caston Sigauke,Ini Adinya*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Fusion Sampling Validation (FSV), a hybrid model combining Simple Random Sampling (SRS) and K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV), to improve data partitioning in machine learning by minimizing biases and enhancing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods like KFCV and SRS have limitations in generalization and computational efficiency. FSV aims to address these issues by merging their strengths.

Method: FSV integrates SRS and KFCV with a weighted factor, tested on datasets of 10K, 50K, and 100K samples. Performance was evaluated using ME, VE, MSE, bias, and convergence rates.

Result: FSV outperformed SRS and KFCV, showing superior accuracy (ME: 0.000863, VE: 0.949644) and reliability, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: FSV provides a practical solution for effective data partitioning in machine learning, balancing simplicity and accuracy.

Abstract: Effective data partitioning is known to be crucial in machine learning.
Traditional cross-validation methods like K-Fold Cross-Validation (KFCV)
enhance model robustness but often compromise generalisation assessment due to
high computational demands and extensive data shuffling. To address these
issues, the integration of the Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which, despite
providing representative samples, can result in non-representative sets with
imbalanced data. The study introduces a hybrid model, Fusion Sampling
Validation (FSV), combining SRS and KFCV to optimise data partitioning. FSV
aims to minimise biases and merge the simplicity of SRS with the accuracy of
KFCV. The study used three datasets of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 samples,
generated with a normal distribution (mean 0, variance 1) and initialised with
seed 42. KFCV was performed with five folds and ten repetitions, incorporating
a scaling factor to ensure robust performance estimation and generalisation
capability. FSV integrated a weighted factor to enhance performance and
generalisation further. Evaluations focused on mean estimates (ME), variance
estimates (VE), mean squared error (MSE), bias, the rate of convergence for
mean estimates (ROC\_ME), and the rate of convergence for variance estimates
(ROC\_VE). Results indicated that FSV consistently outperformed SRS and KFCV,
with ME values of 0.000863, VE of 0.949644, MSE of 0.952127, bias of 0.016288,
ROC\_ME of 0.005199, and ROC\_VE of 0.007137. FSV demonstrated superior
accuracy and reliability in data partitioning, particularly in
resource-constrained environments and extensive datasets, providing practical
solutions for effective machine learning implementations.

### [476] [Is Exploration or Optimization the Problem for Deep Reinforcement Learning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01329)
*Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new sub-optimality estimator reveals deep RL methods exploit only half of the good experience they generate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep RL struggles with optimization difficulties, limiting the effectiveness of improved exploration or reward objectives.

Method: Proposes a practical sub-optimality estimator to assess optimization limitations in deep RL algorithms.

Result: Experiments show deep RL methods exploit only 50% of the best experience generated, with a 2-3x performance gap.

Conclusion: Deep RL optimization challenges hinder full exploitation of generated experience, highlighting a need for better methods.

Abstract: In the era of deep reinforcement learning, making progress is more complex,
as the collected experience must be compressed into a deep model for future
exploitation and sampling. Many papers have shown that training a deep learning
policy under the changing state and action distribution leads to sub-optimal
performance, or even collapse. This naturally leads to the concern that even if
the community creates improved exploration algorithms or reward objectives,
will those improvements fall on the \textit{deaf ears} of optimization
difficulties. This work proposes a new \textit{practical} sub-optimality
estimator to determine optimization limitations of deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. Through experiments across environments and RL algorithms, it is
shown that the difference between the best experience generated is 2-3$\times$
better than the policies' learned performance. This large difference indicates
that deep RL methods only exploit half of the good experience they generate.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes LoRA-based Federated Learning (FL), categorizing aggregation methods into Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS), and provides a unified convergence analysis with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing size of ML models in FL creates communication and computation challenges, and the aggregation of LoRA-updated local models remains understudied.

Method: The paper categorizes aggregation methods (SP and PS), defines the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO), and derives convergence conditions under mild assumptions.

Result: Theoretical analysis proves SP and PS methods satisfy convergence conditions but differ in achieving optimal rates. Experiments validate findings.

Conclusion: The study offers a principled understanding of LoRA-based FL aggregation strategies, with SP and PS both viable but differing in convergence efficiency.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing
size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation
challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into
FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by
updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its
effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains
a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified
convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current
aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).
Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive a
general convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present
several sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the global model.
These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various
aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation
methods both satisfy our convergence condition, but differ in their ability to
achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

### [478] [Quenched large deviations for Monte Carlo integration with Coulomb gases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01392)
*Rémi Bardenet,Mylène Maïda,Martin Rouault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using Gibbs measures, like Coulomb gases, for randomized numerical integration by leveraging particle repulsion to reduce errors. It addresses tuning the Gibbs measure to match a target distribution and shows that random potential approximations preserve performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve numerical integration by utilizing Gibbs measures, where particle repulsion minimizes errors, while overcoming the challenge of tuning the Gibbs measure to align with the target distribution.

Method: Uses large deviations theory to demonstrate that random approximations of the potential maintain performance benefits. For non-singular kernels, minimal assumptions are needed; for Coulomb kernels, the approximation must derive from another Gibbs measure.

Result: Random potential approximations preserve the fast large deviation principle, ensuring the integration algorithm outperforms independent or Markov quadratures. Uniform convergence of the potential approximation is also proven for Coulomb kernels.

Conclusion: The approach effectively integrates Gibbs measures into numerical methods, with theoretical guarantees for performance, even when using approximations for the potential.

Abstract: Gibbs measures, such as Coulomb gases, are popular in modelling systems of
interacting particles. Recently, we proposed to use Gibbs measures as
randomized numerical integration algorithms with respect to a target measure
$\pi$ on $\mathbb R^d$, following the heuristics that repulsiveness between
particles should help reduce integration errors. A major issue in this approach
is to tune the interaction kernel and confining potential of the Gibbs measure,
so that the equilibrium measure of the system is the target distribution $\pi$.
Doing so usually requires another Monte Carlo approximation of the
\emph{potential}, i.e. the integral of the interaction kernel with respect to
$\pi$. Using the methodology of large deviations from Garcia--Zelada (2019), we
show that a random approximation of the potential preserves the fast large
deviation principle that guarantees the proposed integration algorithm to
outperform independent or Markov quadratures. For non-singular interaction
kernels, we make minimal assumptions on this random approximation, which can be
the result of a computationally cheap Monte Carlo preprocessing. For the
Coulomb interaction kernel, we need the approximation to be based on another
Gibbs measure, and we prove in passing a control on the uniform convergence of
the approximation of the potential.

*Stefan Bielmeier,Gerald Friedland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how feature correlations impact Dense Associative Memory (DAM) capacity, showing exponential scaling with input separation and minor capacity reduction due to correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current capacity analyses ignore feature-correlated data, common in practical ML, motivating a study of its effects on DAM.

Method: An empirical framework uses Hamming distance to vary feature correlation and pattern separation, measuring capacity via binary search.

Result: Capacity scales exponentially with separation; correlations slightly reduce it, especially at higher polynomial degrees.

Conclusion: The study links DAM theory to practice, suggesting data-centric methods for better handling feature interactions.

Abstract: We investigate how feature correlations influence the capacity of Dense
Associative Memory (DAM), a Transformer attention-like model. Practical machine
learning scenarios involve feature-correlated data and learn representations in
the input space, but current capacity analyses do not account for this. We
develop an empirical framework to analyze the effects of data structure on
capacity dynamics. Specifically, we systematically construct datasets that vary
in feature correlation and pattern separation using Hamming distance from
information theory, and compute the model's corresponding storage capacity
using a simple binary search algorithm. Our experiments confirm that memory
capacity scales exponentially with increasing separation in the input space.
Feature correlations do not alter this relationship fundamentally, but reduce
capacity slightly at constant separation. This effect is amplified at higher
polynomial degrees in the energy function, suggesting that Associative Memory
is more limited in depicting higher-order interactions between features than
patterns. Our findings bridge theoretical work and practical settings for DAM,
and might inspire more data-centric methods.

TL;DR: CPformer is a Transformer model enhanced with concepts and physics for accurate, explainable time-series forecasting, outperforming baselines on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate, explainable, and physically-credible forecasting for multivariate time-series with varying statistical properties across domains.

Method: CPformer integrates self-supervised, domain-agnostic concepts and enforces differentiable residuals from first-principle constraints, combining latent transparency with scientific guidance.

Result: Achieves lowest error in 8/12 MSE/MAE cells across six datasets, reducing MSE by 23% on Electricity, 44% on Traffic, and 61% on Illness compared to FEDformer.

Conclusion: CPformer effectively combines attention for long contexts with scientific constraints, outperforming prior Transformers in accuracy and explainability.

Abstract: Accurate, explainable and physically-credible forecasting remains a
persistent challenge for multivariate time-series whose statistical properties
vary across domains. We present CPformer, a Concept- and Physics-enhanced
Transformer that channels every prediction through five self-supervised,
domain-agnostic concepts while enforcing differentiable residuals drawn from
first-principle constraints. Unlike prior efficiency-oriented Transformers that
rely purely on sparsity or frequency priors , CPformer combines latent
transparency with hard scientific guidance while retaining attention for long
contexts. We tested CPformer on six publicly-available datasets: sub-hourly
Electricity and Traffic, hourly ETT, high-dimensional Weather, weekly
Influenza-like Illness, and minute-level Exchange Rate, and CPformer achieves
the lowest error in eight of twelve MSE/MAE cells. Relative to the strongest
Transformer baseline (FEDformer), CPformer reduces mean-squared-error by 23% on
Electricity, 44% on Traffic and 61% on Illness, while matching performance on
strictly periodic Weather and ETT series.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning and machine learning models to predict XRP/USDT closing prices, emphasizing the overlooked role of market liquidity. Introducing VVR and VWAP metrics improved prediction accuracy, with LSTM models performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cryptocurrency price prediction models often ignore market liquidity, a key factor in price predictability. This study aims to address this gap by incorporating liquidity metrics.

Method: Four models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) were trained with and without liquidity proxies (VVR, VWAP) to evaluate performance.

Result: LSTM outperformed other models in both scenarios. Including liquidity proxies enhanced prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Market liquidity metrics are crucial for accurate cryptocurrency price predictions, benefiting traders and developers in the U.S. digital assets market.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing rapid growth, but this expansion
comes with significant challenges, particularly in predicting cryptocurrency
prices for traders in the U.S. In this study, we explore how deep learning and
machine learning models can be used to forecast the closing prices of the
XRP/USDT trading pair. While many existing cryptocurrency prediction models
focus solely on price and volume patterns, they often overlook market
liquidity, a crucial factor in price predictability. To address this, we
introduce two important liquidity proxy metrics: the Volume-To-Volatility Ratio
(VVR) and the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP). These metrics provide a
clearer understanding of market stability and liquidity, ultimately enhancing
the accuracy of our price predictions. We developed four machine learning
models, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,
using historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and
evaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the
liquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance. In both cases (with
and without the liquidity proxies), the LSTM model consistently outperformed
the others. These results underscore the importance of considering market
liquidity when predicting cryptocurrency closing prices. Therefore,
incorporating these liquidity metrics is essential for more accurate
forecasting models. Our findings offer valuable insights for traders and
developers seeking to create smarter and more risk-aware strategies in the U.S.
digital assets market.

### [482] [UniExtreme: A Universal Foundation Model for Extreme Weather Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01426)
*Hang Ni,Weijia Zhang,Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting model, addresses limitations in predicting diverse extreme events by integrating spectral and hierarchical drivers, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models for weather forecasting struggle with predicting diverse extreme events due to their focus on general conditions or specific extremes, ignoring real-world atmospheric patterns.

Method: UniExtreme combines an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module to capture spectral differences and an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module to handle hierarchical diversity, using learnable filters and memory fusion.

Result: UniExtreme surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecasting both extreme and general weather, demonstrating adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed UniExtreme model effectively addresses the challenges of predicting extreme weather events by leveraging spectral and hierarchical insights, offering superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of
Foundation Models (FMs) for weather forecasting, yet their ability to predict
extreme weather events remains limited. Existing approaches either focus on
general weather conditions or specialize in specific-type extremes, neglecting
the real-world atmospheric patterns of diversified extreme events. In this
work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral
disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and
geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose
UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that
integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures
region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through
learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation,
and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates
region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity
and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UniExtreme outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both extreme and general weather forecasting, showcasing superior
adaptability across diverse extreme scenarios.

TL;DR: A GAN-based augmentation framework using Mahalanobis-GMM and nearest-neighbor matching to address imbalanced regression by automatically identifying and enriching minority samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced regression models struggle with underrepresented samples due to skewed target distributions, and existing methods rely on fixed thresholds, failing to capture true rare regions.

Method: Proposes a data-driven GAN-based framework with Mahalanobis-GMM for minority sample identification and deterministic nearest-neighbor matching for sparse region enrichment.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation methods on 32 benchmark imbalanced regression datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses imbalanced regression by letting data determine rare samples, improving performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Imbalanced regression arises when the target distribution is skewed, causing
models to focus on dense regions and struggle with underrepresented (minority)
samples. Despite its relevance across many applications, few methods have been
designed specifically for this challenge. Existing approaches often rely on
fixed, ad hoc thresholds to label samples as rare or common, overlooking the
continuous complexity of the joint feature-target space and fail to represent
the true underlying rare regions. To address these limitations, we propose a
fully data-driven GAN-based augmentation framework that uses
Mahalanobis-Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to automatically identify minority
samples and employs deterministic nearest-neighbour matching to enrich sparse
regions. Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine
which observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced
regression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data augmentation methods.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to reduce latency in AI-based CASP systems for drug discovery by using speculative beam search and Medusa drafting, improving throughput by 26-86%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High latency in current CASP systems limits their use in high-throughput synthesizability screening for drug design.

Method: Uses speculative beam search and Medusa drafting to accelerate SMILES-to-SMILES transformers in multi-step synthesis planning.

Result: Achieves 26% to 86% more molecules solved under the same time constraints.

Conclusion: The method improves CASP system latency, meeting high-throughput screening needs and enhancing user experience.

Abstract: AI-based computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) systems are in demand as
components of AI-driven drug discovery workflows. However, the high latency of
such CASP systems limits their utility for high-throughput synthesizability
screening in de novo drug design. We propose a method for accelerating
multi-step synthesis planning systems that rely on SMILES-to-SMILES
transformers as single-step retrosynthesis models. Our approach reduces the
latency of SMILES-to-SMILES transformers powering multi-step synthesis planning
in AiZynthFinder through speculative beam search combined with a scalable
drafting strategy called Medusa. Replacing standard beam search with our
approach allows the CASP system to solve 26\% to 86\% more molecules under the
same time constraints of several seconds. Our method brings AI-based CASP
systems closer to meeting the strict latency requirements of high-throughput
synthesizability screening and improving general user experience.

TL;DR: Transformers underperform RNNs in sequence classification tasks due to lack of a compact state vector and poor local context capture. Introducing history tokens improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the performance gap between transformers and RNNs in sequence classification tasks by identifying limitations and proposing solutions.

Method: Introduces history tokens to accumulate historical information during pretraining, enhancing transformer models.

Result: Significant improvement in transformer-based models across finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks.

Conclusion: History tokens effectively address transformer limitations, boosting performance in sequence classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in modeling sequential data,
including event sequences, temporal point processes, and irregular time series.
Recently, transformers have largely replaced recurrent networks in these tasks.
However, transformers often underperform RNNs in classification tasks where the
objective is to predict future targets. The reason behind this performance gap
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we identify a key limitation of
transformers: the absence of a single state vector that provides a compact and
effective representation of the entire sequence. Additionally, we show that
contrastive pretraining of embedding vectors fails to capture local context,
which is crucial for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, we
introduce history tokens, a novel concept that facilitates the accumulation of
historical information during next-token prediction pretraining. Our approach
significantly improves transformer-based models, achieving impressive results
in finance, e-commerce, and healthcare tasks. The code is publicly available on
GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the NL framework by eliminating hyperparameter tuning and training while maintaining or improving classification performance.

Method: Leverages a universal chaotic sequence from the Champernowne constant and input stimulus to define firing time bounds for feature extraction. Introduces two simplified variants: TM AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet.

Result: AutochaosNet achieves competitive or superior performance to ChaosNet, reduces training time, and shows excellent generalization.

Conclusion: AutochaosNet is scalable and efficient for real-world tasks, with future work exploring universal chaotic orbits for further enhancements.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) is a brain-inspired classification framework that
employs chaotic dynamics to extract features from input data and yields state
of the art performance on classification tasks. However, NL requires the tuning
of multiple hyperparameters and computing of four chaotic features per input
sample. In this paper, we propose AutochaosNet - a novel, hyperparameter-free
variant of the NL algorithm that eliminates the need for both training and
parameter optimization. AutochaosNet leverages a universal chaotic sequence
derived from the Champernowne constant and uses the input stimulus to define
firing time bounds for feature extraction. Two simplified variants - TM
AutochaosNet and TM-FR AutochaosNet - are evaluated against the existing NL
architecture - ChaosNet. Our results demonstrate that AutochaosNet achieves
competitive or superior classification performance while significantly reducing
training time due to reduced computational effort. In addition to eliminating
training and hyperparameter tuning, AutochaosNet exhibits excellent
generalisation capabilities, making it a scalable and efficient choice for
real-world classification tasks. Future work will focus on identifying
universal orbits under various chaotic maps and incorporating them into the NL
framework to further enhance performance.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the cooldown phase in the WSD learning rate scheduler for transformers, revealing a bias-variance trade-off and the impact of cooldown shapes and AdamW hyperparameters on performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mechanisms behind the cooldown phase in transformer training are poorly understood, despite its critical role in performance.

Method: The study focuses on the cooldown phase in the WSD scheduler, analyzing cooldown shapes, AdamW hyperparameters, and loss landscape visualizations.

Result: Different cooldown shapes balance exploration and exploitation, with higher β₂ values improving performance. Loss landscape visualizations support the river valley perspective.

Conclusion: Optimizing the cooldown phase is as crucial as hyperparameter tuning for transformer training, with practical recommendations provided for the WSD scheduler.

Abstract: Learning rate scheduling is essential in transformer training, where the
final annealing plays a crucial role in getting the best performance. However,
the mechanisms behind this cooldown phase, with its characteristic drop in
loss, remain poorly understood. To address this, we provide a comprehensive
analysis focusing solely on the cooldown phase in the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD)
learning rate scheduler. Our analysis reveals that different cooldown shapes
reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off in the resulting models, with
shapes that balance exploration and exploitation consistently outperforming
alternatives. Similarly, we find substantial performance variations
$\unicode{x2013}$ comparable to those from cooldown shape selection
$\unicode{x2013}$ when tuning AdamW hyperparameters. Notably, we observe
consistent improvements with higher values of $\beta_2$ during cooldown. From a
loss landscape perspective, we provide visualizations of the landscape during
cooldown, supporting the river valley loss perspective empirically. These
findings offer practical recommendations for configuring the WSD scheduler in
transformer training, emphasizing the importance of optimizing the cooldown
phase alongside traditional hyperparameter tuning.

TL;DR: InstructTime is an instruction-based time series editor using natural language for flexible, customizable edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming limitations of rigid, predefined attribute vectors in diffusion-based editors for more flexible and accessible time series editing.

Method: Introduces InstructTime, embedding time series and instructions into a shared multi-modal space for decoding edited series with controllable strength.

Result: Achieves high-quality, controllable edits, generalizes to unseen instructions, and adapts to new conditions via few-shot learning.

Conclusion: InstructTime is a state-of-the-art editor offering flexible, customizable time series modifications.

Abstract: In time series editing, we aim to modify some properties of a given time
series without altering others. For example, when analyzing a hospital
patient's blood pressure, we may add a sudden early drop and observe how it
impacts their future while preserving other conditions. Existing
diffusion-based editors rely on rigid, predefined attribute vectors as
conditions and produce all-or-nothing edits through sampling. This attribute-
and sampling-based approach limits flexibility in condition format and lacks
customizable control over editing strength. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Instruction-based Time Series Editing, where users specify intended
edits using natural language. This allows users to express a wider range of
edits in a more accessible format. We then introduce InstructTime, the first
instruction-based time series editor. InstructTime takes in time series and
instructions, embeds them into a shared multi-modal representation space, then
decodes their embeddings to generate edited time series. By learning a
structured multi-modal representation space, we can easily interpolate between
embeddings to achieve varying degrees of edit. To handle local and global edits
together, we propose multi-resolution encoders. In our experiments, we use
synthetic and real datasets and find that InstructTime is a state-of-the-art
time series editor: InstructTime achieves high-quality edits with controllable
strength, can generalize to unseen instructions, and can be easily adapted to
unseen conditions through few-shot learning.

Conclusion: A holistic framework is presented to optimize the model generation pipeline for reliable and efficient latency prediction.

Abstract: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is one of the most promising
techniques for designing efficient Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for
resource-constrained devices. Surrogate models play a crucial role in
hardware-aware NAS as they enable efficient prediction of performance
characteristics (e.g., inference latency and energy consumption) of different
candidate models on the target hardware device. In this paper, we focus on
building hardware-aware latency prediction models. We study different types of
surrogate models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We perform a
systematic analysis to understand the impact of different factors that can
influence the prediction accuracy of these models, aiming to assess the
importance of each stage involved in the model designing process and identify
methods and policies necessary for designing/training an effective estimation
model, specifically for GPU-powered devices. Based on the insights gained from
the analysis, we present a holistic framework that enables reliable dataset
generation and efficient model generation, considering the overall costs of
different stages of the model generation pipeline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlashSVD is a novel framework for SVD-compressed LLMs, reducing peak activation memory by 70.2% and transient memory by 75% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SVD-based compression techniques overlook activation memory overhead during inference, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: FlashSVD integrates rank-aware streaming inference, fusing low-rank projection kernels into self-attention and FFN pipelines to avoid full-size activation buffers.

Result: FlashSVD reduces peak activation memory by 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75% with no accuracy loss.

Conclusion: FlashSVD enables practical deployment of low-rank LLMs by addressing activation memory overhead.

Abstract: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has recently seen a surge of interest as a
simple yet powerful tool for large language models (LLMs) compression, with a
growing number of works demonstrating 20-80% parameter reductions at minimal
accuracy loss. Previous SVD-based approaches have focused primarily on reducing
the memory footprint of model weights, largely overlooking the additional
activation memory overhead incurred during inference when applying truncated
factors via standard dense CUDA kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that this
activation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,
prevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in
peak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,
on-device deployments.
  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference
framework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.
FlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based
methods for parameter reduction. By fusing low-rank projection kernels directly
into both the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) pipelines, FlashSVD
avoid materializing full-size activation buffers. Instead, small tiles of the
truncated factors are loaded into on-chip SRAM, multiplied and reduced on the
fly, and immediately evicted, preserving high GPU occupancy and adding no extra
latency. On standard encoder benchmarks (e.g., BERT-Base), FlashSVD cuts peak
activation memory by up to 70.2% and intermediate transient memory by 75%, all
while incur no accuracy loss with upstreaming compression methods, offering a
practical path toward memory-constrained deployment of low-rank LLMs.

*Menglin Kong,Vincent Zhihao Zheng,Lijun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to improve long-term forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity using spectral initialization and frequency-constrained optimization, enhancing deep models' ability to capture recurring patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern deep forecasting models often fail to capture strong periodic structures in time series due to spectral bias and lack of frequency-aware inductive priors.

Method: Extracts dominant low-frequency components via FFT-guided coordinate descent, initializes sinusoidal embeddings, and uses a two-speed learning schedule to preserve frequency structure.

Result: Consistent performance gains in real-world benchmarks, especially for long horizons, and accurate recovery of ground-truth frequencies in synthetic data.

Conclusion: Injecting spectral priors into deep temporal models improves robustness and interpretability in long-range forecasting.

Abstract: Many real-world time series exhibit strong periodic structures arising from
physical laws, human routines, or seasonal cycles. However, modern deep
forecasting models often fail to capture these recurring patterns due to
spectral bias and a lack of frequency-aware inductive priors. Motivated by this
gap, we propose a simple yet effective method that enhances long-term
forecasting by explicitly modeling periodicity through spectral initialization
and frequency-constrained optimization. Specifically, we extract dominant
low-frequency components via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-guided coordinate
descent, initialize sinusoidal embeddings with these components, and employ a
two-speed learning schedule to preserve meaningful frequency structure during
training. Our approach is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into
existing Transformer-based architectures. Extensive experiments across diverse
real-world benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains--particularly at
long horizons--highlighting the benefits of injecting spectral priors into deep
temporal models for robust and interpretable long-range forecasting. Moreover,
on synthetic data, our method accurately recovers ground-truth frequencies,
further validating its interpretability and effectiveness in capturing latent
periodic patterns.

*Hadi Keramati,Patrick Kirchen,Mohammed Hannan,Rajeev K. Jaiman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A generative optimization framework using fine-tuned diffusion models and reward-directed sampling improves engineering designs, outperforming training data with significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in generating high-performance designs when performance metrics rely on costly simulations or non-differentiable surrogate models.

Method: Uses a parametric design representation, iterative soft value function in a Markov decision process, and reward-guided decoding in diffusion models.

Result: Achieves 25% resistance reduction in 3D ship hulls and 10% lift-to-drag ratio improvement in 2D airfoils, surpassing training data.

Conclusion: The framework enhances designer productivity and design performance, integrating effectively into the engineering lifecycle.

Abstract: This study presents a generative optimization framework that builds on a
fine-tuned diffusion model and reward-directed sampling to generate
high-performance engineering designs. The framework adopts a parametric
representation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets
corresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of
the reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which
performance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models
(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or
prohibitively expensive to differentiate. This work introduces the iterative
use of a soft value function within a Markov decision process framework to
achieve reward-guided decoding in the diffusion model. By incorporating
soft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed
approach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,
even beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative
reward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion
models to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and
enhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed
framework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,
resulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and
over 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil
design. Successful integration of this model into the engineering design life
cycle can enhance both designer productivity and overall design performance.

*S. Parab,A. Lamelas,A. Hassan,P. Bhote*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An AI-based coaching system for paddling uses ML models and LLM feedback, showing feasibility with consumer devices despite small sample size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paddling lacks ML integration and faces high coaching costs, prompting the need for affordable, tech-driven solutions.

Method: Motion data from Apple Watches and smartphones were segmented, features extracted, and ML models (SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extremely Randomized Trees) trained. A web interface delivered feedback.

Result: Extremely Randomized Trees achieved the highest F-score (0.9496). The system provided effective feedback, with wrist sensors improving data quality.

Conclusion: Consumer devices and ML can offer low-cost paddling coaching, though larger studies are needed.

Abstract: Over 22 million Americans participate in paddling-related activities
annually, contributing to a global paddlesports market valued at 2.4 billion US
dollars in 2020. Despite its popularity, the sport has seen limited integration
of machine learning (ML) and remains hindered by the cost of coaching and
specialized equipment. This study presents a novel AI-based coaching system
that uses ML models trained on motion data and delivers stroke feedback via a
large language model (LLM). Participants were recruited through a collaboration
with the NYU Concrete Canoe Team. Motion data were collected across two
sessions, one with suboptimal form and one with corrected technique, using
Apple Watches and smartphones secured in sport straps. The data underwent
stroke segmentation and feature extraction. ML models, including Support Vector
Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extremely Randomized Trees,
were trained on both raw and engineered features. A web based interface was
developed to visualize stroke quality and deliver LLM-based feedback. Across
four participants, eight trials yielded 66 stroke samples. The Extremely
Randomized Tree model achieved the highest performance with an F score of
0.9496 under five fold cross validation. The web interface successfully
provided both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback. Sensor placement
near the wrists improved data quality. Preliminary results indicate that
smartwatches and smartphones can enable low cost, accessible alternatives to
traditional paddling instruction. While limited by sample size, the study
demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer devices and ML to support stroke
refinement and technique improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SimDeep is a Federated Learning framework designed to tackle non-IID data and device heterogeneity in indoor localization, achieving 92.89% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of non-IID data and device heterogeneity in indoor localization systems.

Method: Proposes SimDeep with a Similarity Aggregation Strategy to aggregate client model updates based on data similarity.

Result: Achieves 92.89% accuracy, outperforming traditional federated and centralized methods.

Conclusion: SimDeep is viable for real-world deployment in indoor localization.

Abstract: Indoor localization plays a pivotal role in supporting a wide array of
location-based services, including navigation, security, and context-aware
computing within intricate indoor environments. Despite considerable
advancements, deploying indoor localization systems in real-world scenarios
remains challenging, largely because of non-independent and identically
distributed (non-IID) data and device heterogeneity. In response, we propose
SimDeep, a novel Federated Learning (FL) framework explicitly crafted to
overcome these obstacles and effectively manage device heterogeneity. SimDeep
incorporates a Similarity Aggregation Strategy, which aggregates client model
updates based on data similarity, significantly alleviating the issues posed by
non-IID data. Our experimental evaluations indicate that SimDeep achieves an
impressive accuracy of 92.89%, surpassing traditional federated and centralized
techniques, thus underscoring its viability for real-world deployment.

### [495] [The Vanishing Gradient Problem for Stiff Neural Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01519)
*Colby Fronk,Linda Petzold*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes vanishing gradients in stiff neural ODEs, proving it's a universal issue for A-stable and L-stable methods due to decaying sensitivities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why gradients vanish in stiff neural ODEs and identify the root cause as a limitation of numerical integration schemes.

Method: Analyzes the stability function of stiff integration schemes, providing explicit formulas and proving decay rates.

Result: Shows that all A-stable methods suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, limiting optimization.

Conclusion: Reveals a fundamental barrier in training stiff neural ODEs due to inherent properties of numerical methods.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization of neural differential equations and other
parameterized dynamical systems fundamentally relies on the ability to
differentiate numerical solutions with respect to model parameters. In stiff
systems, it has been observed that sensitivities to parameters controlling
fast-decaying modes become vanishingly small during training, leading to
optimization difficulties. In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient
phenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature
of all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze
the rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and
demonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the
derivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.
Explicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which
illustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the
slowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is
$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping
methods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a
significant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural
ODEs.

*Sahil Sethi,David Chen,Michael C. Burkhart,Nipun Bhandari,Bashar Ramadan,Brett Beaulieu-Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prototype-based neural networks trained for ECG classification capture clinically meaningful patterns, showing strong associations with hospital discharge diagnoses and predictive performance across diverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if prototype-based models, trained for classification, can align with broader clinical phenotypes and provide interpretable insights beyond their original objectives.

Method: A prototype-based deep learning model was trained for multi-label ECG classification using PTB-XL and tested on MIMIC-IV without modification, assessing associations with hospital discharge diagnoses (phecodes).

Result: Prototypes showed stronger associations with clinical outcomes than classifier predictions or NLP-extracted concepts, with high predictive performance (AUCs 0.89-0.91) and differentiation of clinically meaningful variations.

Conclusion: Prototype-based models offer interpretable, transferable phenotypes from physiologic data, capturing clinically relevant signatures beyond initial training goals.

Abstract: Prototype-based neural networks offer interpretable predictions by comparing
inputs to learned, representative signal patterns anchored in training data.
While such models have shown promise in the classification of physiological
data, it remains unclear whether their prototypes capture an underlying
structure that aligns with broader clinical phenotypes. We use a
prototype-based deep learning model trained for multi-label ECG classification
using the PTB-XL dataset. Then without modification we performed inference on
the MIMIC-IV clinical database. We assess whether individual prototypes,
trained solely for classification, are associated with hospital discharge
diagnoses in the form of phecodes in this external population. Individual
prototypes demonstrate significantly stronger and more specific associations
with clinical outcomes compared to the classifier's class predictions,
NLP-extracted concepts, or broader prototype classes across all phecode
categories. Prototype classes with mixed significance patterns exhibit
significantly greater intra-class distances (p $<$ 0.0001), indicating the
model learned to differentiate clinically meaningful variations within
diagnostic categories. The prototypes achieve strong predictive performance
across diverse conditions, with AUCs ranging from 0.89 for atrial fibrillation
to 0.91 for heart failure, while also showing substantial signal for
non-cardiac conditions such as sepsis and renal disease. These findings suggest
that prototype-based models can support interpretable digital phenotyping from
physiologic time-series data, providing transferable intermediate phenotypes
that capture clinically meaningful physiologic signatures beyond their original
training objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic method using a graph neural network solves the NP-hard Elementary Shortest-Path Problem (ESPP) with near-optimal results, outperforming baselines and heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The ESPP is NP-hard due to negative-cost cycles, requiring efficient solutions.

Method: An unsupervised graph neural network learns node values and edge probabilities via a surrogate loss, reducing negative cycles and aligning with the algorithm.

Result: The method outperforms baselines and heuristics on graphs up to 100 nodes, with strong generalization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively solves ESPP with high performance and generalization.

Abstract: The Elementary Shortest-Path Problem(ESPP) seeks a minimum cost path from s
to t that visits each vertex at most once. The presence of negative-cost cycles
renders the problem NP-hard. We present a probabilistic method for finding
near-optimal ESPP, enabled by an unsupervised graph neural network that jointly
learns node value estimates and edge-selection probabilities via a surrogate
loss function. The loss provides a high probability certificate of finding
near-optimal ESPP solutions by simultaneously reducing negative-cost cycles and
embedding the desired algorithmic alignment. At inference time, a decoding
algorithm transforms the learned edge probabilities into an elementary path.
Experiments on graphs of up to 100 nodes show that the proposed method
surpasses both unsupervised baselines and classical heuristics, while
exhibiting high performance in cross-size and cross-topology generalization on
unseen synthetic graphs.

TL;DR: The paper introduces KANMixer, a novel architecture using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), outperforming traditional MLP-based methods in most benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLP-based LTSF methods lack hierarchical locality and sequential inductive biases, leading to diminishing improvements. KAN's adaptive basis functions offer potential for better modeling.

Method: Proposes KANMixer, integrating KAN's adaptive capabilities into a multi-scale mixing backbone for LTSF.

Result: KANMixer achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven datasets. Analysis shows KAN's flexibility transforms structural prior influence.

Conclusion: KANMixer demonstrates KAN's effectiveness in LTSF, providing empirical guidelines for its use. Code is available for further exploration.

Abstract: In recent years, multilayer perceptrons (MLP)-based deep learning models have
demonstrated remarkable success in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF).
Existing approaches typically augment MLP backbones with hand-crafted external
modules to address the inherent limitations of their flat architectures.
Despite their success, these augmented methods neglect hierarchical locality
and sequential inductive biases essential for time-series modeling, and recent
studies indicate diminishing performance improvements. To overcome these
limitations, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), a recently proposed
model featuring adaptive basis functions capable of granular, local modulation
of nonlinearities. This raises a fundamental question: Can KAN serve as a new
modeling core for LTSF? To answer this, we introduce KANMixer, a concise
architecture integrating a multi-scale mixing backbone that fully leverages
KAN's adaptive capabilities. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that KANMixer
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 16 out of 28 experiments across seven
benchmark datasets. To uncover the reasons behind this strong performance, we
systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of KANMixer in comparison
with traditional MLP architectures. Our findings reveal that the adaptive
flexibility of KAN's learnable basis functions significantly transforms the
influence of network structural prior on forecasting performance. Furthermore,
we identify critical design factors affecting forecasting accuracy and offer
practical insights for effectively utilizing KAN in LTSF. Together, these
insights constitute the first empirically grounded guidelines for effectively
leveraging KAN in LTSF. Code is available in the supplementary file.

*Heting Liu,Junzhe Huang,Fang He,Guohong Cao*

TL;DR: DC-PFL is a dynamic clustering algorithm for personalized federated learning that groups clients based on data similarities using model discrepancy, reducing training time and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning to enhance model performance.

Method: Dynamic clustering using model discrepancy, layer-wise aggregation, and training loss curve analysis.

Result: Reduced training time and improved model accuracy compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DC-PFL effectively handles data heterogeneity and optimizes federated learning performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables edge devices to collaboratively learn a
global model, but it may not perform well when clients have high data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm for
personalized federated learning system (DC-PFL) to address the problem of data
heterogeneity. DC-PFL starts with all clients training a global model and
gradually groups the clients into smaller clusters for model personalization
based on their data similarities. To address the challenge of estimating data
heterogeneity without exposing raw data, we introduce a discrepancy metric
called model discrepancy, which approximates data heterogeneity solely based on
the model weights received by the server. We demonstrate that model discrepancy
is strongly and positively correlated with data heterogeneity and can serve as
a reliable indicator of data heterogeneity. To determine when and how to change
grouping structures, we propose an algorithm based on the rapid decrease period
of the training loss curve. Moreover, we propose a layer-wise aggregation
mechanism that aggregates the low-discrepancy layers at a lower frequency to
reduce the amount of transmitted data and communication costs. We conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets to evaluate our proposed algorithm,
and our results show that DC-PFL significantly reduces total training time and
improves model accuracy compared to baselines.

Motivation: To explore the potential of DMs in enhancing wireless communication systems due to their noise-robust performance and ability to handle complex data.

Method: Provides a tutorial on DMs, reviews their applications in wireless networks (e.g., optimizers, reinforcement learning), and discusses emerging issues like channel modeling and resource management.

Result: Highlights DMs' effectiveness in various wireless communication tasks but notes technical limitations.

Conclusion: DMs show promise for future networks, but further research is needed to address limitations and expand applications.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) in recent years has catalyzed

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A human-in-the-loop diffusion framework improves topology optimization by integrating human feedback to detect and correct design flaws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current denoising diffusion models for topology optimization rely on surrogate predictors, which may miss critical design flaws obvious to humans.

Method: A lightweight reward model trained on binary human feedback is used to steer the generative process, modulating the reverse diffusion trajectory to suppress unrealistic outputs.

Result: Preliminary results show reduced failure modes and improved design realism.

Conclusion: The framework bridges automated design generation and expert judgment, offering scalable and trustworthy generative design.

Abstract: Recent advances in denoising diffusion models have enabled rapid generation
of optimized structures for topology optimization. However, these models often
rely on surrogate predictors to enforce physical constraints, which may fail to
capture subtle yet critical design flaws such as floating components or
boundary discontinuities that are obvious to human experts. In this work, we
propose a novel human-in-the-loop diffusion framework that steers the
generative process using a lightweight reward model trained on minimal human
feedback. Inspired by preference alignment techniques in generative modeling,
our method learns to suppress unrealistic outputs by modulating the reverse
diffusion trajectory using gradients of human-aligned rewards. Specifically, we
collect binary human evaluations of generated topologies and train classifiers
to detect floating material and boundary violations. These reward models are
then integrated into the sampling loop of a pre-trained diffusion generator,
guiding it to produce designs that are not only structurally performant but
also physically plausible and manufacturable. Our approach is modular and
requires no retraining of the diffusion model. Preliminary results show
substantial reductions in failure modes and improved design realism across
diverse test conditions. This work bridges the gap between automated design
generation and expert judgment, offering a scalable solution to trustworthy
generative design.

TL;DR: The paper justifies the heuristic weighting function in denoising score matching by showing heteroskedasticity is inherent, derives optimal weighting functions, and finds the heuristic can outperform optimal weighting in practice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work used heuristic weighting for denoising score matching without formal justification. This work aims to provide a principled derivation and understanding of weighting functions.

Method: The authors demonstrate heteroskedasticity in the denoising score matching objective, derive optimal weighting functions for arbitrary-order losses, and analyze the heuristic's performance.

Result: The heuristic weighting function is shown to be a first-order Taylor approximation of the optimal weighting. It can achieve lower variance in parameter gradients, aiding stable training.

Conclusion: The heuristic weighting, despite its simplicity, is justified and can be more effective than the optimal weighting in practice, offering insights for diffusion model training.

Abstract: Score matching enables the estimation of the gradient of a data distribution,
a key component in denoising diffusion models used to recover clean data from
corrupted inputs. In prior work, a heuristic weighting function has been used
for the denoising score matching loss without formal justification. In this
work, we demonstrate that heteroskedasticity is an inherent property of the
denoising score matching objective. This insight leads to a principled
derivation of optimal weighting functions for generalized, arbitrary-order
denoising score matching losses, without requiring assumptions about the noise
distribution. Among these, the first-order formulation is especially relevant
to diffusion models. We show that the widely used heuristical weighting
function arises as a first-order Taylor approximation to the trace of the
expected optimal weighting. We further provide theoretical and empirical
comparisons, revealing that the heuristical weighting, despite its simplicity,
can achieve lower variance than the optimal weighting with respect to parameter
gradients, which can facilitate more stable and efficient training.

TL;DR: CAMEL is a dynamic framework for learning from heterogeneous data streams, using dedicated experts and a collaborative assistance mechanism to handle concept drifts and improve generalizability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with heterogeneous streams and static architectures, limiting adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: CAMEL assigns independent systems to each stream, uses specialized private experts, and employs a collaborative assistance expert with multi-head attention for knowledge transfer. An Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) dynamically manages expert lifecycles.

Result: CAMEL shows superior generalizability and resilience against complex concept drifts in experiments.

Conclusion: CAMEL effectively addresses heterogeneity and concept drifts, offering robust online adaptation for multistream learning.

Abstract: Learning from multiple data streams in real-world scenarios is fundamentally
challenging due to intrinsic heterogeneity and unpredictable concept drifts.
Existing methods typically assume homogeneous streams and employ static
architectures with indiscriminate knowledge fusion, limiting generalizability
in complex dynamic environments. To tackle this gap, we propose CAMEL, a
dynamic \textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}ssistance \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{E}xperts \textbf{L}earning framework. It addresses heterogeneity by
assigning each stream an independent system with a dedicated feature extractor
and task-specific head. Meanwhile, a dynamic pool of specialized private
experts captures stream-specific idiosyncratic patterns. Crucially,
collaboration across these heterogeneous streams is enabled by a dedicated
assistance expert. This expert employs a multi-head attention mechanism to
distill and integrate relevant context autonomously from all other concurrent
streams. It facilitates targeted knowledge transfer while inherently mitigating
negative transfer from irrelevant sources. Furthermore, we propose an
Autonomous Expert Tuner (AET) strategy, which dynamically manages expert
lifecycles in response to drift. It instantiates new experts for emerging
concepts (freezing prior ones to prevent catastrophic forgetting) and prunes
obsolete ones. This expert-level plasticity provides a robust and efficient
mechanism for online model capacity adaptation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CAMEL's superior generalizability across diverse multistreams and
exceptional resilience against complex concept drifts.

Conclusion: EPRLI demonstrates competitive performance, offering a replicable alternative to proprietary models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning scaling enhances the reasoning capabilities of large

draw out complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs, such as those in the OpenAI O series, Claude 3 series,
DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 series, and Grok 3 series, remain undisclosed, making it
difficult for the research community to replicate their reinforcement learning

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Augmented Reinforcement Learning (ARL) framework to improve decision-making in ML models by incorporating external agents for feedback and data quality assurance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the 'Garbage-In, Garbage-Out' problem in reinforcement learning by ensuring quality data and corrective feedback.

Method: Uses two external agents: one for real-time feedback and another for curated feedback, applied to document identification and extraction.

Result: Human feedback enhances model robustness and accuracy, especially in complex environments.

Conclusion: ARL offers a scalable solution for improving model performance in data-driven applications.

Abstract: This work proposes a novel technique Augmented Reinforcement Learning
framework for the improvement of decision-making capabilities of machine
learning models. The introduction of agents as external overseers checks on
model decisions. The external agent can be anyone, like humans or automated
scripts, that helps in decision path correction. It seeks to ascertain the
priority of the "Garbage-In, Garbage-Out" problem that caused poor data inputs
or incorrect actions in reinforcement learning. The ARL framework incorporates
two external agents that aid in course correction and the guarantee of quality
data at all points of the training cycle. The External Agent 1 is a real-time
evaluator, which will provide feedback light of decisions taken by the model,
identify suboptimal actions forming the Rejected Data Pipeline. The External
Agent 2 helps in selective curation of the provided feedback with relevance and
accuracy in business scenarios creates an approved dataset for future training
cycles. The validation of the framework is also applied to a real-world
scenario, which is "Document Identification and Information Extraction". This
problem originates mainly from banking systems, but can be extended anywhere.
The method of classification and extraction of information has to be done
correctly here. Experimental results show that including human feedback
significantly enhances the ability of the model in order to increase robustness
and accuracy in making decisions. The augmented approach, with a combination of
machine efficiency and human insight, attains a higher learning standard-mainly
in complex or ambiguous environments. The findings of this study show that
human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning frameworks such as ARL can provide a
scalable approach to improving model performance in data-driven applications.

Method: TCDiff cascades three diffusion networks (Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, Target Modality Diffusion) to generate high-fidelity EHR data.

Result: TCDiff outperforms baselines by 10% in fidelity under various missing rates and maintains privacy, validated on public datasets and TCM-SZ1.

Conclusion: TCDiff is effective, robust, and generalizable for real-world healthcare EHR generation.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs)
remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large
foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial
volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has
emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series
of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of
heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual
modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle
pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex
Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades
three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data,
formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion,
Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate
our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and
introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking.
Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate,
while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the
effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world
healthcare scenarios.

### [507] [IMU: Influence-guided Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01620)
*Xindi Fan,Jing Wu,Mingyi Zhou,Pengwei Liang,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a method for selectively forgetting data points in deep learning models without needing the original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models memorize training data, risking privacy leaks. Current machine unlearning (MU) methods require access to original data, which is impractical.

Method: IMU uses gradient ascent and dynamically allocates unlearning intensities based on data point influences, requiring only the forget set.

Result: IMU outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods in vision and language tasks.

Conclusion: IMU is a practical and effective solution for machine unlearning without retaining original data.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

*Yuanteng Chen,Yuantian Shao,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAC-MoE addresses GPU memory and inference speed challenges in MoE-LLMs via quantization (QESC) and pruning (PESF), reducing memory usage and improving speed with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE-LLMs face high GPU memory demands and inefficient inference due to low activated parameters, requiring solutions for quantization bias and expert pruning.

Method: Proposes QESC to calibrate routers for quantization bias and PESF to prune less-used experts, aligning with MoE characteristics.

Result: Significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: EAC-MoE effectively tackles MoE-LLM challenges, offering a balanced solution for memory and speed without major performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has demonstrated promising potential in scaling
LLMs. However, it is hindered by two critical challenges: (1) substantial GPU
memory consumption to load all experts; (2) low activated parameters cannot be
equivalently translated into inference acceleration effects. In this work, we
propose EAC-MoE, an Expert-Selection Aware Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which
deeply aligns with the characteristics of MoE from the perspectives of
quantization and pruning, and introduces two modules to address these two
challenges respectively: (1) The expert selection bias caused by low-bit
quantization is a major factor contributing to the performance degradation in
MoE-LLMs. Based on this, we propose Quantization with Expert-Selection
Calibration (QESC), which mitigates the expert selection bias by calibrating
the routers within the MoE; (2) There are always certain experts that are not
crucial for the corresponding tasks, yet causing inference latency. Therefore,
we propose Pruning based on Expert-Selection Frequency (PESF), which
significantly improves inference speed by pruning less frequently used experts
for current task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed with minimal
performance degradation.

### [509] [Learning Unified System Representations for Microservice Tail Latency Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01635)
*Wenzhuo Qian,Hailiang Zhao,Tianlv Chen,Jiayi Chen,Ziqi Wang,Kingsum Chow,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: USRFNet is a deep learning model for predicting P95 tail latency in microservices by separating and fusing traffic-side and resource-side features, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microservices' distributed nature complicates performance monitoring, and traditional latency metrics are noisy and inadequate for holistic system behavior.

Method: USRFNet uses GNNs for service interactions and gMLP for resource dynamics, fusing them into a unified embedding for latency prediction.

Result: USRFNet achieves high accuracy in predicting window-level P95 latency, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: USRFNet effectively addresses challenges in microservice performance monitoring by integrating complementary data modalities for accurate latency prediction.

Abstract: Microservice architectures have become the de facto standard for building
scalable cloud-native applications, yet their distributed nature introduces
significant challenges in performance monitoring and resource management.
Traditional approaches often rely on per-request latency metrics, which are
highly sensitive to transient noise and fail to reflect the holistic behavior
of complex, concurrent workloads. In contrast, window-level P95 tail latency
provides a stable and meaningful signal that captures both system-wide trends
and user-perceived performance degradation. We identify two key shortcomings in
existing methods: (i) inadequate handling of heterogeneous data, where
traffic-side features propagate across service dependencies and resource-side
signals reflect localized bottlenecks, and (ii) the lack of principled
architectural designs that effectively distinguish and integrate these
complementary modalities. To address these challenges, we propose USRFNet, a
deep learning network that explicitly separates and models traffic-side and
resource-side features. USRFNet employs GNNs to capture service interactions
and request propagation patterns, while gMLP modules independently model
cluster resource dynamics. These representations are then fused into a unified
system embedding to predict window-level P95 latency with high accuracy. We
evaluate USRFNet on real-world microservice benchmarks under large-scale stress
testing conditions, demonstrating substantial improvements in prediction
accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Tianpei Lu,Bingsheng Zhang,Lekun Peng,Bowen Zheng,Lichun Li,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme is proposed for secure multi-party computation (MPC) to reduce overhead in privacy-preserving model inference, achieving significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for secure inference in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare, addressing high overhead in MPC and privacy risks in existing quantized methods.

Method: Proposes a layer-wise quantization scheme, 1-bit weight fully connected layers, multi-input lookup tables for softmax, and dual secret sharing for precision conversion.

Result: Achieves up to 8×, 9×, and 22× speedups compared to prior works.

Conclusion: The approach significantly improves efficiency and privacy in secure model inference.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of generative machine learning models in
privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and personalized services,
ensuring secure inference has become a critical challenge. Secure multi-party
computation (MPC) enables privacy-preserving model inference but suffers from
high communication and computation overhead. The main bottleneck lies in the
expensive secure evaluation of floating-point operations. Quantization offers a
promising solution by converting floating-point operations into lower-precision
integer computations, significantly reducing overhead. However, existing
MPC-based quantized inference methods either rely on public quantization
parameters-posing privacy risks-or suffer from inefficiencies, particularly in
handling nonlinear functions such as activations and softmax. In this work, we
propose a fine-grained, layer-wise quantization scheme and support 1-bit weight
fully connected layers in a secure setting. We design a multi-input lookup
table protocol to evaluate softmax efficiently and securely. Furthermore, we
use dual secret sharing schemes and perform precision conversions via lookup
tables, eliminating truncation overhead entirely. Experimental evaluation on
BERT-base models demonstrates that our approach achieves up to $8\times$
speedup compared to Lu \emph{et al}. (NDSS 25), $9\times$ speedup compared to
Gupta \emph{et al}. (PETS 24) and $22 \times$ speedup compared to Knott
\emph{et al}. (NeurIPS 21).

TL;DR: SPARTA leverages spike-timing dynamics for efficient sparse attention in SNNs, reducing complexity while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SNNs overlook precise timing information, missing rich computational cues. SPARTA aims to exploit these dynamics for better efficiency and performance.

Method: SPARTA uses heterogeneous neuron dynamics and spike-timing cues (firing patterns, timing, intervals) for competitive gating, achieving 65.4% sparsity.

Result: Achieves SOTA on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%).

Conclusion: Exploiting spike timing dynamics enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in SNNs.

Abstract: Current Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) underutilize the temporal dynamics
inherent in spike-based processing, relying primarily on rate coding while
overlooking precise timing information that provides rich computational cues.
We propose SPARTA (Spiking Priority Attention with Resource-Adaptive Temporal
Allocation), a framework that leverages heterogeneous neuron dynamics and
spike-timing information to enable efficient sparse attention. SPARTA
prioritizes tokens based on temporal cues, including firing patterns, spike
timing, and inter-spike intervals, achieving 65.4% sparsity through competitive
gating. By selecting only the most salient tokens, SPARTA reduces attention
complexity from O(N^2) to O(K^2) with k << n, while maintaining high accuracy.
Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on DVS-Gesture (98.78%) and
competitive results on CIFAR10-DVS (83.06%) and CIFAR-10 (95.3%), demonstrating
that exploiting spike timing dynamics improves both computational efficiency
and accuracy.

*Ziru Niu,Hai Dong,A. K. Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-heterogeneous federated learning framework improves generalization by exchanging feature distributions instead of model parameters, using synthetic data for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data heterogeneity in federated learning without requiring model aggregation, enhancing generalization performance.

Method: Clients share feature distributions (mean, covariance) with the server; train a VTC network to generate synthetic data for local model fine-tuning.

Result: Higher generalization accuracy, lower communication costs, and reduced memory consumption compared to existing frameworks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively tackles data heterogeneity in model-heterogeneous FL settings, improving performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a pioneering machine learning paradigm that
enables distributed clients to process local data effectively while ensuring
data privacy. However, the efficacy of FL is usually impeded by the data
heterogeneity among clients, resulting in local models with low generalization
performance. To address this problem, traditional model-homogeneous approaches
mainly involve debiasing the local training procedures with regularization or
dynamically adjusting client weights in aggregation. Nonetheless, these
approaches become incompatible for scenarios where clients exhibit
heterogeneous model architectures. In this paper, we propose a
model-heterogeneous FL framework that can improve clients' generalization
performance over unseen data without model aggregation. Instead of model
parameters, clients exchange the feature distributions with the server,
including the mean and the covariance. Accordingly, clients train a variational
transposed convolutional (VTC) neural network with Gaussian latent variables
sampled from the feature distributions, and use the VTC model to generate
synthetic data. By fine-tuning local models with the synthetic data, clients
significantly increase their generalization performance. Experimental results
show that our approach obtains higher generalization accuracy than existing
model-heterogeneous FL frameworks, as well as lower communication costs and
memory consumption

TL;DR: The paper extends Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) to handle non-convex objectives and heterogeneous datasets, introducing staleness-aware aggregation and dynamic learning rates to improve convergence and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Federated Learning (FL) faces issues like communication overhead and system heterogeneity, which AFL aims to address, but challenges remain with non-convex objectives and heterogeneous data.

Method: The paper proposes staleness-aware aggregation and dynamic learning rate scheduling, along with rigorous convergence analysis for AFL under non-convex and heterogeneous conditions.

Result: The framework improves stability and convergence, validated through experiments showing better performance in asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed AFL extension is practical for real-world applications, accommodating computational, data, and communication variations while enhancing scalability and performance.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, traditional FL
suffers from communication overhead, system heterogeneity, and straggler
effects. Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) addresses these by allowing
clients to update independently, improving scalability and reducing
synchronization delays. This paper extends AFL to handle non-convex objective
functions and heterogeneous datasets, common in modern deep learning. We
present a rigorous convergence analysis, deriving bounds on the expected
gradient norm and studying the effects of staleness, variance, and
heterogeneity. To mitigate stale updates, we introduce a staleness aware
aggregation that prioritizes fresher updates and a dynamic learning rate
schedule that adapts to client staleness and heterogeneity, improving stability
and convergence. Our framework accommodates variations in computational power,
data distribution, and communication delays, making it practical for real world
applications. We also analyze the impact of client selection
strategies-sampling with or without replacement-on variance and convergence.
Implemented in PyTorch with Python's asyncio, our approach is validated through
experiments demonstrating improved performance and scalability for
asynchronous, heterogeneous, and non-convex FL scenarios.

*Alberto Maria Metelli,Simone Drago,Marco Mussi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We study the regret minimization problem in the novel setting of generalized
kernelized bandits (GKBs), where we optimize an unknown function $f^*$
belonging to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) having access to samples
generated by an exponential family (EF) noise model whose mean is a non-linear
function $\mu(f^*)$. This model extends both kernelized bandits (KBs) and
generalized linear bandits (GLBs). We propose an optimistic algorithm, GKB-UCB,
and we explain why existing self-normalized concentration inequalities do not
allow to provide tight regret guarantees. For this reason, we devise a novel
self-normalized Bernstein-like dimension-free inequality resorting to
Freedman's inequality and a stitching argument, which represents a contribution
of independent interest. Based on it, we conduct a regret analysis of GKB-UCB,
deriving a regret bound of order $\widetilde{O}( \gamma_T \sqrt{T/\kappa_*})$,
being $T$ the learning horizon, ${\gamma}_T$ the maximal information gain, and
$\kappa_*$ a term characterizing the magnitude the reward nonlinearity. Our
result matches, up to multiplicative constants and logarithmic terms, the
state-of-the-art bounds for both KBs and GLBs and provides a unified view of
both settings.

TL;DR: A novel hybrid tokenisation method for tabular data combines fixed tokens and BPE to efficiently prepare structured data for LLMs, demonstrated on a large-scale NetFlow dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and LLMs for structured tabular data, which existing methods fail to cohesively encode.

Method: Hybrid tokenisation using predefined fixed tokens for structural elements and low-cardinality categorical features, and BPE for high-cardinality and continuous values.

Result: Processed 31M network flows in under five hours with a 6.18:1 compression ratio, creating a manageable corpus of 1B+ tokens.

Conclusion: The method provides a viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured data.

Abstract: Data representation remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning,
particularly when adapting sequence-based architectures like Transformers and
Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured tabular data. Existing methods
often fail to cohesively encode the mix of numerical and categorical features
or preserve the inherent structure of tables. This paper introduces a novel,
hybrid tokenisation methodology designed to convert tabular data into a
unified, sequential format suitable for LLM training. Our approach combines
predefined fixed tokens to represent structural elements and low-cardinality
categorical features, with a learned subword vocabulary using Byte-Pair
Encoding (BPE) for high-cardinality and continuous values. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this technique by applying it to a large-scale NetFlow dataset
(CIDDS-001), preparing a corpus for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
foundation model. The evaluation shows that our method is highly efficient,
processing over 31 million network flows in under five hours and achieving a
significant data compression ratio of 6.18:1. This process resulted in a
computationally manageable corpus of over one billion tokens, establishing a
viable and generalisable pathway for training foundation models on structured
data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PHAR is a framework that converts numeric feature attributions into human-readable rules for time series classification, improving interpretability and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of interpreting raw time series and high-dimensional input spaces in ML models motivates the need for a unified, interpretable framework.

Method: PHAR transforms feature attributions into structured rules, uses rule fusion for consolidation, and introduces visualization techniques.

Result: PHAR performs comparably to rule-based methods, scales efficiently, and improves interpretability and decision transparency.

Conclusion: PHAR enhances model transparency and practical applicability for time series classification tasks.

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) models for time series (TS) classification
remains challenging due to the difficulty of interpreting raw time series and
the high dimensionality of the input space. We introduce PHAR-Post-hoc
Attribution Rules-a unified framework that transforms numeric feature
attributions from post-hoc, instance-wise explainers (e.g., LIME, SHAP) into
structured, human-readable rules. These rules define interpretable intervals
that indicate where and when key decision boundaries occur, enhancing model
transparency. PHAR performs comparably to native rule-based methods, such as
Anchor, while scaling more efficiently to long TS sequences and achieving
broader instance coverage. A dedicated rule fusion step consolidates rule sets
using strategies like weighted selection and lasso-based refinement, balancing
key quality metrics: coverage, confidence, and simplicity. This fusion ensures
each instance receives a concise and unambiguous rule, improving both
explanation fidelity and consistency. We further introduce visualization
techniques to illustrate specificity-generalization trade-offs in the derived
rules. PHAR resolves conflicting and overlapping explanations-a common effect
of the Rashomon phenomenon-into coherent, domain-adaptable insights.
Comprehensive experiments on UCI datasets demonstrate that PHAR improves
interpretability, decision transparency, and practical applicability for TS
classification tasks.

Conclusion: Combining multimodal fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning improves HAR accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in applications such as

systems often rely on single modalities, such as motion sensors or cameras,
limiting robustness and accuracy in real-world environments. This work presents
FedTime-MAGNET, a novel multimodal federated learning framework that advances
HAR by combining heterogeneous data sources: depth cameras, pressure mats, and
accelerometers. At its core is the Multimodal Adaptive Graph Neural Expert
Transformer (MAGNET), a fusion architecture that uses graph attention and a
Mixture of Experts to generate unified, discriminative embeddings across
modalities. To capture complex temporal dependencies, a lightweight T5 encoder
only architecture is customized and adapted within this framework. Extensive
experiments show that FedTime-MAGNET significantly improves HAR performance,
achieving a centralized F1 Score of 0.934 and a strong federated F1 Score of
0.881. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining multimodal
fusion, time series LLMs, and federated learning for building accurate and

TL;DR: A physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI) framework is proposed for solving stochastic optimal control problems using second-order HJB equations, with systematic error control and theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings, providing interpretability and theoretical foundations for policy evaluation.

Method: Neural networks approximate value functions by minimizing residuals of linear PDEs induced by fixed policies, enabling systematic error control and explicit bounds.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on benchmark problems like stochastic cartpole, pendulum, and high-dimensional LQR up to 10D.

Conclusion: PINN-PI offers a robust, interpretable, and theoretically grounded approach for stochastic optimal control, inheriting classical policy iteration guarantees.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed neural network policy iteration (PINN-PI)
framework for solving stochastic optimal control problems governed by
second-order Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations. At each iteration, a
neural network is trained to approximate the value function by minimizing the
residual of a linear PDE induced by a fixed policy. This linear structure
enables systematic $L^2$ error control at each policy evaluation step, and
allows us to derive explicit Lipschitz-type bounds that quantify how value
gradient errors propagate to the policy updates. This interpretability provides
a theoretical basis for evaluating policy quality during training. Our method
extends recent deterministic PINN-based approaches to stochastic settings,
inheriting the global exponential convergence guarantees of classical policy
iteration under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on several benchmark problems, including stochastic cartpole, pendulum problems
and high-dimensional linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problems in up to 10D.

TL;DR: CcGAN-AVAR improves conditional generative modeling by addressing data imbalance and sampling inefficiency in CcGAN and CCDM, offering faster inference and better generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CcGAN and CCDM have limitations—data imbalance and slow sampling—which hinder their effectiveness in high-dimensional data distribution estimation.

Method: CcGAN-AVAR introduces an adaptive vicinity mechanism and a multi-task discriminator to tackle data imbalance and leverages GAN's one-step generation for faster inference.

Result: The method achieves 300x-2000x faster inference and superior generation quality across four benchmark datasets in imbalanced settings.

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR sets a new standard for conditional generative modeling by combining efficiency and high-quality generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: OccamVTS distills 1% of essential predictive info from large vision models (LVMs) into lightweight networks, improving time series forecasting accuracy by eliminating irrelevant visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVMs enhance forecasting but contain 99% unnecessary parameters, impairing accuracy due to misalignment with time series features.

Method: Proposes OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework using pyramid-style feature alignment and correlation distillation to transfer only relevant patterns.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 1% of original parameters, excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by focusing on essential temporal patterns, outperforming LVMs in forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AGFT, an adaptive GPU frequency tuner using reinforcement learning, reduces GPU energy consumption by 44.3% with minimal latency overhead (<10%), optimizing energy-delay product by 40.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high energy costs of cloud GPUs due to low-latency demands of LLMs, coupled with dynamic workload volatility, create a need for efficient power management without sacrificing performance.

Method: AGFT employs online reinforcement learning to autonomously learn optimal GPU frequency tuning policies, using real-time monitoring of request load and latency, fine-grained frequency control, and action space pruning.

Result: AGFT achieves 44.3% energy savings with under 10% latency overhead, optimizing the Energy-Delay Product by 40.3%.

Conclusion: AGFT significantly enhances energy efficiency and economic benefits of LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

Abstract: The explosive growth of interactive Large Language Models (LLMs) has placed
unprecedented demands for low latency on cloud GPUs, forcing them into
high-power modes and causing escalating energy costs. Real-time inference
workloads exhibit significant dynamic volatility, presenting substantial
energy-saving opportunities. However, traditional static or rule-based power
management strategies struggle to exploit these opportunities without
compromising peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose AGFT (An
Adaptive GPU Frequency Tuner), a framework that employs online reinforcement
learning to autonomously learn an optimal frequency tuning policy. By
monitoring real-time features like request load and latency, AGFT utilizes
fine-grained frequency control for precise adjustments and intelligent action
space pruning for stable, efficient decision-making. This creates a robust,
automated energy management solution. We comprehensively evaluated AGFT in an
environment simulating realistic, fluctuating inference requests. The
experimental results demonstrate that AGFT successfully saves 44.3% of GPU
energy consumption while introducing a minimal performance latency overhead of
under 10%. This achievement translates into a comprehensive Energy-Delay
Product (EDP) optimization of up to 40.3%, clearly showing that our framework
can significantly enhance the energy efficiency and economic benefits of
existing LLM inference clusters without compromising service quality.

*Xiangwang Hou,Jingjing Wang,Fangming Guan,Jun Du,Chunxiao Jiang,Yong Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDPQ is an energy-efficient federated learning framework for real-time computer vision on edge devices, combining data augmentation, model pruning, quantization, and power control to optimize performance under unreliable wireless conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of energy-intensive computation, communication, and non-i.i.d. data in federated learning for resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Integrates diffusion-based data augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and adaptive power control, with a Bayesian optimization-based algorithm for joint tuning.

Result: Achieves superior convergence speed and energy efficiency in experiments on representative CV tasks.

Conclusion: FedDPQ is the first framework to jointly optimize FL performance from data, computation, and communication perspectives under unreliable wireless conditions.

Abstract: Emerging real-time computer vision (CV) applications on wireless edge devices
demand energy-efficient and privacy-preserving learning. Federated learning
(FL) enables on-device training without raw data sharing, yet remains
challenging in resource-constrained environments due to energy-intensive
computation and communication, as well as limited and non-i.i.d. local data. We
propose FedDPQ, an ultra energy-efficient FL framework for real-time CV over
unreliable wireless networks. FedDPQ integrates diffusion-based data
augmentation, model pruning, communication quantization, and transmission power
control to enhance training efficiency. It expands local datasets using
synthetic data, reduces computation through pruning, compresses updates via
quantization, and mitigates transmission outages with adaptive power control.
We further derive a closed-form energy-convergence model capturing the coupled
impact of these components, and develop a Bayesian optimization(BO)-based
algorithm to jointly tune data augmentation strategy, pruning ratio,
quantization level, and power control. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to jointly optimize FL performance from the perspectives of
data, computation, and communication under unreliable wireless conditions.
Experiments on representative CV tasks show that FedDPQ achieves superior
convergence speed and energy efficiency.

TL;DR: SemGuide improves semantic alignment in conditional diffusion models for time series forecasting using a scoring network and stepwise importance reweighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic misalignment between generated trajectories and conditioning covariates in diffusion models, especially under complex or multimodal conditions.

Method: Introduces a scoring network to evaluate semantic alignment and uses stepwise importance reweighting to adjust sampling paths without altering training.

Result: Consistent gains in predictive accuracy and covariate alignment, especially in complex conditioning scenarios.

Conclusion: SemGuide is a model-agnostic, plug-and-play method that enhances diffusion models' performance in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong performance in time series
forecasting, yet often suffer from semantic misalignment between generated
trajectories and conditioning covariates, especially under complex or
multimodal conditions. To address this issue, we propose SemGuide, a
plug-and-play, inference-time method that enhances covariate consistency in
conditional diffusion models. Our approach introduces a scoring network to
assess the semantic alignment between intermediate diffusion states and future
covariates. These scores serve as proxy likelihoods in a stepwise importance
reweighting procedure, which progressively adjusts the sampling path without
altering the original training process. The method is model-agnostic and
compatible with any conditional diffusion framework. Experiments on real-world
forecasting tasks show consistent gains in both predictive accuracy and
covariate alignment, with especially strong performance under complex
conditioning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for jointly training gradient estimators and model weights, introducing Pseudo-linear TO for efficient optimization, outperforming benchmarks like ADAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace manual gradient estimators (e.g., ADAM) with trainable optimizers for better performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduces Pseudo-linear TO, a linear approximation of full gradients, and two simplified variants for computational efficiency.

Result: TO methods converge faster than benchmarks (e.g., ADAM) in convex, non-convex, and LLM fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: Trainable optimizers like Pseudo-linear TO offer efficient, high-performance alternatives to traditional gradient estimators.

Abstract: The concept of learning to optimize involves utilizing a trainable
optimization strategy rather than relying on manually defined full gradient
estimations such as ADAM. We present a framework that jointly trains the full
gradient estimator and the trainable weights of the model. Specifically, we
prove that pseudo-linear TO (Trainable Optimizer), a linear approximation of
the full gradient, matches SGD's convergence rate while effectively reducing
variance. Pseudo-linear TO incurs negligible computational overhead, requiring
only minimal additional tensor multiplications. To further improve
computational efficiency, we introduce two simplified variants of Pseudo-linear
TO. Experiments demonstrate that TO methods converge faster than benchmark
algorithms (e.g., ADAM) in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, and
fine tuning of an LLM.

*Shiyan Liu,Bohan Tan,Yan Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VAGPO, a novel method combining ResNet and Transformer, improves training efficiency and generalization for routing problems like TSP and CVRP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in training efficiency and generalization of data-driven methods for combinatorial optimization problems like TSP and CVRP.

Method: Uses ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, with an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy for faster convergence.

Result: Achieves competitive solution quality and strong generalization to large-scale instances (up to 1000 nodes) without re-training.

Conclusion: VAGPO is effective in learning efficiency and scalability for routing problems.

Abstract: The routing problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) are well-known combinatorial
optimization challenges with broad practical relevance. Recent data-driven
optimization methods have made significant progress, yet they often face
limitations in training efficiency and generalization to large-scale instances.
In this paper, we propose a novel Vision-Augmented Asymmetric Group Preference
Optimization (VAGPO) approach for solving the routing problems. By leveraging
ResNet-based visual encoding and Transformer-based sequential modeling, VAGPO
captures both spatial structure and temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we
introduce an asymmetric group preference optimization strategy that
significantly accelerates convergence compared to commonly used policy gradient
methods. Experimental results on TSP and CVRP benchmarks show that the proposed
VAGPO not only achieves highly competitive solution quality but also exhibits
strong generalization to larger instances (up to 1000 nodes) without
re-training, highlighting its effectiveness in both learning efficiency and
scalability.

*Ignacy Stępka,Nicholas Gisolfi,Kacper Trębacz,Artur Dubrawski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses persistent client dropout in asynchronous Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) and introduces adaptive strategies to recover performance loss, showing effectiveness despite limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Client dropout in asynchronous DFL complicates recovery due to limited information about model updates, data distributions, and loss functions.

Method: Proposes adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction, evaluated on tabular and image datasets with three DFL algorithms and data heterogeneity scenarios.

Result: Adaptive strategies effectively recover some performance loss and maintain robustness, though not precisely reconstructing missing data.

Conclusion: The strategies are promising but have limitations, suggesting future work to further address client dropout.

Abstract: We consider the problem of persistent client dropout in asynchronous
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL). Asynchronicity and decentralization
obfuscate information about model updates among federation peers, making
recovery from a client dropout difficult. Access to the number of learning
epochs, data distributions, and all the information necessary to precisely
reconstruct the missing neighbor's loss functions is limited. We show that
obvious mitigations do not adequately address the problem and introduce
adaptive strategies based on client reconstruction. We show that these
strategies can effectively recover some performance loss caused by dropout. Our
work focuses on asynchronous DFL with local regularization and differs
substantially from that in the existing literature. We evaluate the proposed
methods on tabular and image datasets, involve three DFL algorithms, and three
data heterogeneity scenarios (iid, non-iid, class-focused non-iid). Our
experiments show that the proposed adaptive strategies can be effective in
maintaining robustness of federated learning, even if they do not reconstruct
the missing client's data precisely. We also discuss the limitations and
identify future avenues for tackling the problem of client dropout.

*Haoran Li,Muhao Guo,Yang Weng,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a continuous ODE-based optimal control approach for time-series analysis, combining discrete-time models for context with control-theoretical guarantees for robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using unconstrained neural networks for dynamics approximation struggle with distributional shifts, motivating a control-theoretic approach for better adaptability.

Method: The method involves designing control actions from discrete-time models and applying optimal control algorithms, using model predictive control for multi-step trajectory planning.

Result: The approach achieves exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions, validated by superior generalization and adaptability in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed coordinate model with control-theoretic guarantees outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in time-series tasks.

Abstract: Deep sequence models have achieved notable success in time-series analysis,
such as interpolation and forecasting. Recent advances move beyond
discrete-time architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) toward
continuous-time formulations such as the family of Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs). Generally, they have shown that capturing the
underlying dynamics is beneficial for generic tasks like interpolation,
extrapolation, and classification. However, existing methods approximate the
dynamics using unconstrained neural networks, which struggle to adapt reliably
under distributional shifts. In this paper, we recast time-series problems as
the continuous ODE-based optimal control problem. Rather than learning dynamics
solely from data, we optimize control actions that steer ODE trajectories
toward task objectives, bringing control-theoretical performance guarantees. To
achieve this goal, we need to (1) design the appropriate control actions and
(2) apply effective optimal control algorithms. As the actions should contain
rich context information, we propose to employ the discrete-time model to
process past sequences and generate actions, leading to a coordinate model to
extract long-term temporal features to modulate short-term continuous dynamics.
During training, we apply model predictive control to plan multi-step future
trajectories, minimize a task-specific cost, and greedily select the optimal
current action. We show that, under mild assumptions, this multi-horizon
optimization leads to exponential convergence to infinite-horizon solutions,
indicating that the coordinate model can gain robust and generalizable
performance. Extensive experiments on diverse time-series datasets validate our
method's superior generalization and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.

*Gian Marco Paldino,Gianluca Bontempi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TD2C is a supervised learning framework for discovering causal relationships in complex time series by recognizing persistent asymmetries in information flow, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods for causal discovery in multivariate time series struggle with non-linear dynamics and lack of clear conditional independencies.

Method: TD2C uses supervised learning to identify causal signatures from information-theoretic and statistical descriptors, trained on synthetic data.

Result: TD2C achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in high-dimensional and non-linear settings, with strong zero-shot generalization.

Conclusion: TD2C offers a robust, scalable approach for causal discovery in complex systems by shifting from statistical testing to pattern recognition.

Abstract: Discovering causal relationships in complex multivariate time series is a
fundamental scientific challenge. Traditional methods often falter, either by
relying on restrictive linear assumptions or on conditional independence tests
that become uninformative in the presence of intricate, non-linear dynamics.
This paper proposes a new paradigm, shifting from statistical testing to
pattern recognition. We hypothesize that a causal link creates a persistent and
learnable asymmetry in the flow of information through a system's temporal
graph, even when clear conditional independencies are obscured. We introduce
Temporal Dependency to Causality (TD2C), a supervised learning framework that
operationalizes this hypothesis. TD2C learns to recognize these complex causal
signatures from a rich set of information-theoretic and statistical
descriptors. Trained exclusively on a diverse collection of synthetic time
series, TD2C demonstrates remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen
dynamics and established, realistic benchmarks. Our results show that TD2C
achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming established
methods, particularly in high-dimensional and non-linear settings. By reframing
the discovery problem, our work provides a robust and scalable new tool for
uncovering causal structures in complex systems.

*Ning Yang,Pengyu Wang,Guoqing Liu,Haifeng Zhang,Pin Lyu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) introduces a preemptive penalty mechanism and constraint-aware intrinsic reward to improve stability and reduce constraint violations in Safe RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing issues like constraint violations and instability in Safe RL, the paper proposes PCPO as a proactive alternative to the reactive Lagrangian method.

Method: PCPO integrates barrier items into the objective function and uses a constraint-aware intrinsic reward for boundary-aware exploration. It also employs policy iteration for optimization.

Result: Theoretical bounds for duality gap and performance are established. PCPO shows significant stability and robustness in experiments.

Conclusion: PCPO offers a robust solution for constrained policy optimization, with potential for future research and practical applications.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) often faces significant issues such as
constraint violations and instability, necessitating the use of constrained
policy optimization, which seeks optimal policies while ensuring adherence to
specific constraints like safety. Typically, constrained optimization problems
are addressed by the Lagrangian method, a post-violation remedial approach that
may result in oscillations and overshoots. Motivated by this, we propose a
novel method named Proactive Constrained Policy Optimization (PCPO) that
incorporates a preemptive penalty mechanism. This mechanism integrates barrier
items into the objective function as the policy nears the boundary, imposing a
cost. Meanwhile, we introduce a constraint-aware intrinsic reward to guide
boundary-aware exploration, which is activated only when the policy approaches
the constraint boundary. We establish theoretical upper and lower bounds for
the duality gap and the performance of the PCPO update, shedding light on the
method's convergence characteristics. Additionally, to enhance the optimization
performance, we adopt a policy iteration approach. An interesting finding is
that PCPO demonstrates significant stability in experiments. Experimental
results indicate that the PCPO framework provides a robust solution for policy
optimization under constraints, with important implications for future research
and practical applications.

Result: RL agent balances demand-supply within 2%, maintains near-optimal costs, and handles renewable variability; blockchain ensures transparency and security.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, transparent solution for prosumer trading, with practical insights for deployment.

Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in day-ahead energy
markets introduces challenges in balancing supply and demand, ensuring grid
resilience, and maintaining trust in decentralized trading systems. This paper
proposes a novel framework that integrates the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method, with
blockchain technology to optimize automated trading strategies for prosumers in
day-ahead energy markets. We introduce a comprehensive framework that employs
RL agent for multi-objective energy optimization and blockchain for
tamper-proof data and transaction management. Simulations using real-world data
from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The RL agent achieves demand-supply balancing
within 2\% and maintains near-optimal supply costs for the majority of the
operating hours. Moreover, it generates robust battery storage policies capable
of handling variability in solar and wind generation. All decisions are
recorded on an Algorand-based blockchain, ensuring transparency, auditability,
and security - key enablers for trustworthy multi-agent energy trading. Our
contributions include a novel system architecture, curriculum learning for
robust agent development, and actionable policy insights for practical
deployment.

### [531] [How Does Controllability Emerge In Language Models During Pretraining?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01892)
*Jianshu She,Xinyue Li,Eric Xing,Zhengzhong Liu,Qirong Ho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how linear steerability in language models emerges during training and introduces a framework (Intervention Detector) to analyze this phenomenon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the unclear conditions for effective interventions in language models and how steerability evolves during training.

Method: Develops the Intervention Detector (ID) framework to analyze linear steerability dynamics through hidden state and representation analysis, using metrics like heatmaps and cosine similarity.

Result: Finds that linear steerability emerges in intermediate training stages, with concepts becoming increasingly linearly separable in hidden space.

Conclusion: The ID framework provides insights into steerability dynamics, applicable across model families, enhancing understanding of intervention efficacy.

Abstract: Language models can be steered by modifying their internal representations to
control concepts such as emotion, style, or truthfulness in generation.
However, the conditions for an effective intervention remain unclear and are
often validated through heuristics and trial-and-error. To fill this gap, we
demonstrate that intervention efficacy, measured by linear steerability (i.e.,
the ability to adjust output via linear transformations of hidden states),
emerges during intermediate stages of training. Moreover, even closely related
concepts (e.g., anger and sadness) exhibit steerability emergence at distinct
stages of training.
  To better interpret the dynamics of steerability during training, we adapt
existing intervention techniques into a unified framework, referred to as the
"Intervention Detector" (ID), which is designed to reveal how linear
steerability evolves over the course of training through hidden state and
representation analysis. ID reveals that concepts become increasingly linearly
separable in the hidden space as training progresses, which strongly correlates
with the emergence of linear steerability. We further introduce ID-based
metrics, such as heatmaps, entropy trends, and cosine similarity, to help
interpret how linear steerability evolves throughout training. In addition, we
apply ID across different model families to ensure the generality of our
findings on steerability dynamics.

*Istabrak Abbes,Gopeshh Subbaraj,Matthew Riemer,Nizar Islah,Benjamin Therien,Tsuguchika Tabaru,Hiroaki Kingetsu,Sarath Chandar,Irina Rish*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores continual pre-training for LLMs to avoid retraining from scratch, evaluating experience replay and gradient alignment to mitigate distribution shifts. Both methods stabilize learning without forgetting, with gradient alignment being newly effective for LLMs. Efficient MER is proposed, and scaling analysis suggests replaying old examples is more valuable than increasing model size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiency in retraining LLMs from scratch when new data arrives, the paper investigates continual pre-training methods to prevent performance degradation due to distribution shifts.

Method: Evaluates experience replay and gradient alignment in continual pre-training of Llama models at scale (100B tokens per language). Proposes an efficient MER implementation combining both techniques.

Result: Both methods stabilize learning without forgetting. Gradient alignment is effective for LLMs. Small replay rates are more compute-efficient than scaling model size.

Conclusion: Continual pre-training with replay and gradient alignment is viable for LLMs, with replay being more efficient than model scaling. Efficient MER combines benefits of both methods.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

*Xinting Huang,Michael Hahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Neighbor Distance Minimization (NDM), an unsupervised method to find interpretable subspaces in neural model representations, showing connections to model variables and circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how neural models organize and encode different aspects of inputs in separate subspaces and whether these can be found unsupervised.

Method: Proposes Neighbor Distance Minimization (NDM) to learn non-basis-aligned subspaces without supervision.

Result: NDM finds interpretable subspaces linked to abstract concepts and model variables, validated in GPT-2 circuits and scalable to larger models.

Conclusion: NDM provides a new way to understand model internals and circuit construction, offering insights into representation organization.

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel iterative framework improves GNN explanation robustness by aligning training and explanation graph distributions, enhancing reliability and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The mismatch between training and explanation graphs in GNNs leads to unreliable gradients and poor explanation quality, especially for sparse subgraphs.

Method: Proposes an iterative framework alternating between explanation subgraph identification and model adaptation, refining explanations progressively.

Result: Consistently improves explanation quality across benchmarks and integrates flexibly with various GNN architectures.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses distributional shift issues, offering robust and high-quality explanations for GNN predictions.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in a wide
range of graph-related learning tasks. However, explaining their predictions
remains a challenging problem, especially due to the mismatch between the
graphs used during training and those encountered during explanation. Most
existing methods optimize soft edge masks on weighted graphs to highlight
important substructures, but these graphs differ from the unweighted graphs on
which GNNs are trained. This distributional shift leads to unreliable gradients
and degraded explanation quality, especially when generating small, sparse
subgraphs. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative explanation
framework which improves explanation robustness by aligning the model's
training data distribution with the weighted graph distribution appeared during
explanation. Our method alternates between two phases: explanation subgraph
identification and model adaptation. It begins with a relatively large
explanation subgraph where soft mask optimization is reliable. Based on this
subgraph, we assign importance-aware edge weights to explanatory and
non-explanatory edges, and retrain the GNN on these weighted graphs. This
process is repeated with progressively smaller subgraphs, forming an iterative
refinement procedure. We evaluate our method on multiple benchmark datasets
using different GNN backbones and explanation methods. Experimental results
show that our method consistently improves explanation quality and can be
flexibly integrated with different architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Transition Machines (TMs) and Dual Behavior Mealy Machines (DBMMs) to address limitations in handling non-Markovian observations in POMDPs, proposing an efficient learning algorithm (DB-RPNI) with significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning policies in partially observable environments is challenging due to non-Markovian observations, and existing automaton representations and inference methods are limited or computationally expensive.

Method: The authors introduce TMs to complement Reward Machines (RMs) and propose DBMMs to unify both. They develop DB-RPNI, a passive automata learning algorithm, with optimizations for efficiency.

Result: DB-RPNI achieves speedups of up to three orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed DBMM and DB-RPNI effectively address limitations in automaton inference for POMDPs, offering significant computational advantages.

Abstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are fundamental to
many real-world applications. Although reinforcement learning (RL) has shown
success in fully observable domains, learning policies from traces in partially
observable environments remains challenging due to non-Markovian observations.
Inferring an automaton to handle the non-Markovianity is a proven effective
approach, but faces two limitations: 1) existing automaton representations
focus only on reward-based non-Markovianity, leading to unnatural problem
formulations; 2) inference algorithms face enormous computational costs. For
the first limitation, we introduce Transition Machines (TMs) to complement
existing Reward Machines (RMs). To develop a unified inference algorithm for
both automata types, we propose the Dual Behavior Mealy Machine (DBMM) that
subsumes both TMs and RMs. We then introduce DB-RPNI, a passive automata
learning algorithm that efficiently infers DBMMs while avoiding the costly
reductions required by prior work. We further develop optimization techniques
and identify sufficient conditions for inferring the minimal correct automata.
Experimentally, our inference method achieves speedups of up to three orders of
magnitude over SOTA baselines.

TL;DR: MolReasoner is a two-stage framework (Mol-SFT and Mol-RL) enhancing LLMs' molecular reasoning by combining synthetic CoT samples and reinforcement learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches lack domain-specific molecular semantics and face interpretability challenges, prompting the need for a framework like MolReasoner.

Method: MolReasoner uses Mol-SFT for initial reasoning via GPT-4o-generated CoT samples, followed by Mol-RL with specialized reward functions for alignment.

Result: MolReasoner improves interpretability, molecular understanding, and generalization, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: MolReasoner shifts LLMs from memorization to robust chemical reasoning, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: Meta-learning improves few-shot concept learning, especially for compositional tasks, outperforming supervised learning. Second-order methods and extended gradient adaptation enhance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if gradient-based meta-learning can enable neural networks to efficiently learn discrete concepts from few examples, comparing it to supervised learning.

Method: Meta-learning methods are tested against supervised learning on Boolean tasks from a PCFG, varying concept dimensionality and compositionality.

Result: Meta-learners handle compositional complexity better than featural complexity, with improved performance and sample efficiency. Extended gradient adaptation boosts generalization.

Conclusion: Meta-learning excels in few-shot learning of compositional concepts, with second-order methods and extended adaptation playing key roles.

Abstract: Rapidly learning abstract concepts from limited examples is a hallmark of
human intelligence. This work investigates whether gradient-based meta-learning
can equip neural networks with inductive biases for efficient few-shot
acquisition of discrete concepts. We compare meta-learning methods against a
supervised learning baseline on Boolean tasks generated by a probabilistic
context-free grammar (PCFG). By systematically varying concept dimensionality
(number of features) and compositionality (depth of grammar recursion), we
identify regimes in which meta-learning robustly improves few-shot concept
learning. We find improved performance and sample efficiency by training a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) across concept spaces increasing in dimensional and
compositional complexity. We are able to show that meta-learners are much
better able to handle compositional complexity than featural complexity and
establish an empirical analysis demonstrating how featural complexity shapes
'concept basins' of the loss landscape, allowing curvature-aware optimization
to be more effective than first order methods. We see that we can robustly
increase generalization on complex concepts by increasing the number of
adaptation steps in meta-SGD, encouraging exploration of rougher loss basins.
Overall, this work highlights the intricacies of learning compositional versus
featural complexity in high dimensional concept spaces and provides a road to
understanding the role of 2nd order methods and extended gradient adaptation in
few-shot concept learning.

*Dekang Meng,Rabab Haider,Pascal van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiGridML is a neural framework for power grid topology optimization, replacing NP-hard MIP with GNNs to achieve faster and better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MIP methods for power grid topology optimization are computationally intractable for large networks.

Method: Uses a two-stage neural architecture: LGNN for DC power flow approximation and HeteroGNN for breaker state prediction, linked by physics-informed loss.

Result: Achieves up to 18% power export improvement and reduces inference time from hours to milliseconds.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of flow-aware GNNs for combinatorial optimization in physical systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces OptiGridML, a machine learning framework for discrete
topology optimization in power grids. The task involves selecting substation
breaker configurations that maximize cross-region power exports, a problem
typically formulated as a mixed-integer program (MIP) that is NP-hard and
computationally intractable for large networks. OptiGridML replaces repeated
MIP solves with a two-stage neural architecture: a line-graph neural network
(LGNN) that approximates DC power flows for a given network topology, and a
heterogeneous GNN (HeteroGNN) that predicts breaker states under structural and
physical constraints. A physics-informed consistency loss connects these
components by enforcing Kirchhoff's law on predicted flows. Experiments on
synthetic networks with up to 1,000 breakers show that OptiGridML achieves
power export improvements of up to 18% over baseline topologies, while reducing
inference time from hours to milliseconds. These results demonstrate the
potential of structured, flow-aware GNNs for accelerating combinatorial
optimization in physical networked systems.

*Xiaoya Li,Xiaofei Sun,Albert Wang,Chris Shum,Jiwei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CRINN introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach for optimizing approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms, achieving top performance on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ANNS algorithms are crucial for AI applications like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLMs, but optimizing them manually is labor-intensive. CRINN aims to automate this process.

Method: CRINN treats ANNS optimization as a reinforcement learning problem, using execution speed as the reward signal to generate progressively faster implementations while maintaining accuracy.

Result: CRINN outperforms state-of-the-art ANNS algorithms on three benchmark datasets and ties on two others.

Conclusion: CRINN demonstrates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning can automate complex algorithmic optimizations, extending beyond ANNS to other domains.

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

*Alexander Norcliffe,Changhee Lee,Fergus Imrie,Mihaela van der Schaar,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel latent variable model for active feature acquisition outperforms traditional methods by avoiding myopic decisions and training difficulties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of Reinforcement Learning and greedy mutual information maximization in active feature acquisition.

Method: Introduces a supervised latent variable model for sequential feature selection, reasoning over stochastic latent space.

Result: Outperforms diverse baselines on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves dynamic feature acquisition.

Abstract: Active Feature Acquisition is an instance-wise, sequential decision making
problem. The aim is to dynamically select which feature to measure based on
current observations, independently for each test instance. Common approaches
either use Reinforcement Learning, which experiences training difficulties, or
greedily maximize the conditional mutual information of the label and
unobserved features, which makes myopic acquisitions. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce a latent variable model, trained in a supervised
manner. Acquisitions are made by reasoning about the features across many
possible unobserved realizations in a stochastic latent space. Extensive
evaluation on a large range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrates that
our approach reliably outperforms a diverse set of baselines.

### [541] [Kronecker-LoRA: hybrid Kronecker-LoRA adapters for scalable, sustainable fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01961)
*Yixin Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kron-LoRA is a parameter-efficient adapter for fine-tuning large language models, combining Kronecker product factorization and low-rank compression to reduce parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for adapters that are both parameter-efficient and expressive for multi-task fine-tuning of large language models.

Method: Kron-LoRA factorizes linear updates as a Kronecker product and compresses one factor via low-rank decomposition, reducing parameters while retaining expressivity.

Result: Kron-LoRA matches or outperforms standard LoRA adapters with fewer parameters, achieves better quantization, and shows competitive cross-task transfer.

Conclusion: Kron-LoRA provides a scalable, efficient, and continual-learning-ready solution for adapting large language models across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Fine-tuning massive pre-trained language models across many tasks demands
adapters that are both parameter-efficient and highly expressive. We introduce
\textbf{Kron-LoRA}, a two-stage adapter that first factorizes each frozen
linear update as a Kronecker product \[ \Delta W = A \otimes B \] and then
compresses \[ B \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{B2}\times d_{B1}} \] via an \(r\)-rank LoRA
decomposition \(B \approx B_{1}B_{2}\). By leveraging \[ \mathrm{rank}(A
\otimes B) \;=\; \mathrm{rank}(A)\,\mathrm{rank}(B), \] Kron-LoRA retains the
expressivity of the update while using up to $4\!\times\!$ fewer parameters
than a standard rank-8 LoRA adapter. Its compact adapter matrices also quantize
to 8- or 4-bit with less accuracy degradation than LoRA, enabling further
memory and storage savings for on-device deployment. We benchmark on DistilBERT
and Mistral-7B across five tasks (PIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC-Easy,
ARC-Challenge) over multiple epochs of adapter-only tuning: on DistilBERT, an
840 K-parameter Kron-LoRA matches LoRA-16's performance, and on Mistral-7B, a
5.7 M-parameter Kron-LoRA rivals LoRA-8 with modest memory savings and only a
3-8\% speed overhead. In sequential fine-tuning from ARC-Challenge to ARC-Easy,
Kron-LoRA retains 55.18\% accuracy versus 53.17\% for LoRA-8-despite using only
one-quarter of the adapter parameters-underscoring its competitive cross-task
transfer performance. By uniting Kronecker structure, low-rank compression,
quantization-friendliness, and by providing transparent trade-off analysis,
Kron-LoRA offers a scalable, sustainable, and continual-learning-ready solution
for multi-task adaptation of large language models.

### [542] [Accelerating LLM Reasoning via Early Rejection with Partial Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01969)
*Seyyed Saeid Cheshmi,Azal Ahmad Khan,Xinran Wang,Zirui Liu,Ali Anwar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores using Process Reward Models (PRMs) mid-generation to reject suboptimal reasoning steps early, reducing computational overhead without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving the computational efficiency of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks by leveraging intermediate reward signals.

Method: Proposes using PRMs as Partial Reward Models to enable early rejection of suboptimal reasoning steps based on token-level signals.

Result: Achieves a 1.4×-9× reduction in inference FLOPs on math reasoning benchmarks without performance loss.

Conclusion: Early rejection via PRMs is a viable approach to enhance the compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for solving complex
reasoning tasks in domains such as mathematics, logic, and multi-step question
answering. A growing line of work seeks to improve reasoning quality by scaling
inference time compute particularly through Process Reward Models (PRMs), used
to reward the reasoning at intermediate steps. While effective, these methods
introduce substantial computational overhead, especially when generating large
numbers of solutions in parallel. In this paper, we investigate whether PRMs
can be used mid-generation to provide early signals that enable the rejection
of suboptimal candidates before full generation of step is complete. We
introduce the hypothesis that PRMs are also Partial Reward Models, meaning that
the scores they assign to partially completed reasoning step are predictive of
final output quality. This allows for principled early rejection based on
intermediate token-level signals. We support this hypothesis both
theoretically, by proving that the risk of discarding optimal beams decreases
exponentially with generation length and empirically, by demonstrating a strong
correlation between partial and final rewards across multiple reward models. On
math reasoning benchmarks, our method achieves up to 1.4$\times$-9$\times$
reduction in inference FLOPs without degrading final performance. These results
suggest that early rejection is a powerful mechanism for improving the
compute-efficiency of reasoning in LLMs.

*Rituparna Datta,Jiaming Cui,Zihan Guan,Rupesh Silwal,Joshua C Eby,Gregory Madden,Anil Vullikanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework integrates structured and unstructured EHR data using a two-stage LLM and graph-based retrieval method, achieving high AUC scores for clinical predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving clinical outcome prediction by leveraging multimodal EHR data for early intervention and better patient care.

Method: Two-stage architecture: 1) LLM extracts task-relevant info from notes, enhanced by graph-based retrieval; 2) Combines unstructured and structured data for predictions.

Result: AUC scores of 0.84 (30-day readmission) and 0.92 (in-hospital mortality), outperforming baselines and clinical practices.

Conclusion: The framework effectively combines LLM and structured data, advancing healthcare prediction with robust performance.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and
improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured
data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific
information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available
information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In
the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial,
task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based
retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus
like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both
unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to
generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical
tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and
in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework
achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$,
respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with
positive rates ranging from approximately $4\%$ to $13\%$. Moreover, it
outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including
established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of
the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an
LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with
structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeanK is a learning-based method to prune unimportant key cache channels in LLMs, reducing GPU memory and speeding up decoding without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address efficiency challenges in LLMs caused by growing key-value (KV) cache, which impacts performance.

Method: Uses a two-stage training process to learn static channel masks for pruning, meeting sparsity and hardware alignment requirements.

Result: Achieves up to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction, with 1.3x speedup in attention computation.

Conclusion: LeanK effectively optimizes LLM efficiency for long-context tasks while maintaining accuracy and providing insights into model behavior.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into
model channels and attention heads during long-context inference by analyzing
the learned importance distribution. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAFNet, a compact architecture for irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) forecasting, retains Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) and outperforms graph-based models by efficiently handling pre-aligned series with reduced compute overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMTS modeling is challenging due to uneven sampling and inter-variate asynchrony. Existing methods like CPA or graph-based models have limitations in efficiency or capturing global correlations.

Method: KAFNet combines (1) Pre-Convolution for smoothing, (2) Temporal Kernel Aggregation for irregularity modeling, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention for low-cost inter-series correlation modeling.

Result: KAFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with 7.2× fewer parameters and 8.4× faster training-inference.

Conclusion: Retaining CPA and optimizing its handling with KAFNet outperforms alternatives, offering a scalable solution for IMTS forecasting.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS), characterized by uneven sampling
and inter-variate asynchrony, fuel many forecasting applications yet remain
challenging to model efficiently. Canonical Pre-Alignment (CPA) has been widely
adopted in IMTS modeling by padding zeros at every global timestamp, thereby
alleviating inter-variate asynchrony and unifying the series length, but its
dense zero-padding inflates the pre-aligned series length, especially when
numerous variates are present, causing prohibitive compute overhead. Recent
graph-based models with patching strategies sidestep CPA, but their local
message passing struggles to capture global inter-variate correlations.
Therefore, we posit that CPA should be retained, with the pre-aligned series
properly handled by the model, enabling it to outperform state-of-the-art
graph-based baselines that sidestep CPA. Technically, we propose KAFNet, a
compact architecture grounded in CPA for IMTS forecasting that couples (1)
Pre-Convolution module for sequence smoothing and sparsity mitigation, (2)
Temporal Kernel Aggregation module for learnable compression and modeling of
intra-series irregularity, and (3) Frequency Linear Attention blocks for the
low-cost inter-series correlations modeling in the frequency domain.
Experiments on multiple IMTS datasets show that KAFNet achieves
state-of-the-art forecasting performance, with a 7.2$\times$ parameter
reduction and a 8.4$\times$ training-inference acceleration.

TL;DR: CellForge is an AI-driven system for autonomously building computational models for virtual cells, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in perturbation prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of biological systems and the need for interdisciplinary expertise make autonomous virtual cell modeling challenging.

Method: CellForge uses a multi-agent framework with three modules: Task Analysis, Method Design (with specialized agents and a moderator), and Experiment Execution to generate optimized models from raw data.

Result: CellForge outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods in single-cell perturbation prediction across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: Iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing perspectives yields better solutions than direct modeling, as demonstrated by CellForge.

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: To systematically organize and analyze the evolution of diffusion-based methods for inverse imaging problems, identifying commonalities, trade-offs, and unresolved issues.

Method: Categorizes approaches into explicit approximations and others (variational inference, sequential Monte Carlo, decoupled data consistency), and reviews extensions for blind cases, high-dimensional data, and multimodal information.

Result: Provides a structured overview of diffusion-based inverse problem solvers, comparing assumptions and performance trade-offs.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for further theoretical and practical advancements in diffusion model-based inverse problem solving.

Abstract: Using diffusion priors to solve inverse problems in imaging have
significantly matured over the years. In this chapter, we review the various
different approaches that were proposed over the years. We categorize the
approaches into the more classic explicit approximation approaches and others,
which include variational inference, sequential monte carlo, and decoupled data
consistency. We cover the extension to more challenging situations, including
blind cases, high-dimensional data, and problems under data scarcity and
distribution mismatch. More recent approaches that aim to leverage multimodal
information through texts are covered. Through this chapter, we aim to (i)
distill the common mathematical threads that connect these algorithms, (ii)
systematically contrast their assumptions and performance trade-offs across
representative inverse problems, and (iii) spotlight the open theoretical and
practical challenges by clarifying the landscape of diffusion model based
inverse problem solvers.

TL;DR: DLDA is a diffusion-based attack framework that generates fake users to manipulate recommender systems, achieving strong item promotion while evading detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing shilling attacks often fail to balance strong adversarial promotion and realistic behavior, leaving the true severity of threats underappreciated.

Method: DLDA uses a conditional latent diffusion process in a collaborative embedding space to synthesize fake user profiles with precise control over target items, aided by dispersive regularization for realism.

Result: DLDA outperforms prior attacks in promoting target items and evading detection across three datasets and five RS models.

Conclusion: Modern recommender systems are more vulnerable than previously thought, necessitating stronger defenses.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are now fundamental to various online platforms,
but their dependence on user-contributed data leaves them vulnerable to
shilling attacks that can manipulate item rankings by injecting fake users.
Although widely studied, most existing attack models fail to meet two critical
objectives simultaneously: achieving strong adversarial promotion of target
items while maintaining realistic behavior to evade detection. As a result, the
true severity of shilling threats that manage to reconcile the two objectives
remains underappreciated. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we present
DLDA, a diffusion-based attack framework that can generate highly effective yet
indistinguishable fake users by enabling fine-grained control over target
promotion. Specifically, DLDA operates in a pre-aligned collaborative embedding
space, where it employs a conditional latent diffusion process to iteratively
synthesize fake user profiles with precise target item control. To evade
detection, DLDA introduces a dispersive regularization mechanism that promotes
variability and realism in generated behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets and five popular RS models demonstrate that,
compared to prior attacks, DLDA consistently achieves stronger item promotion
while remaining harder to detect. These results highlight that modern RSs are
more vulnerable than previously recognized, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust defenses.

### [549] [CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Verifiable Generative Credit Assignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02298)
*Guofu Xie,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Ting Yao,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPO introduces a fine-grained credit assignment method for RLVR, using an LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model to provide token-level rewards, improving learning efficiency and policy quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods assign uniform rewards to all tokens, hindering precise credit assignment and leading to suboptimal policies. CAPO addresses this by enabling token-level feedback.

Method: CAPO leverages an off-the-shelf LLM (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate step-wise critiques for token-level rewards, enhancing credit assignment. A voting mechanism improves robustness.

Result: CAPO outperforms supervised and RL-based methods on six mathematical and three out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across different model sizes.

Conclusion: CAPO provides a scalable, efficient solution for fine-grained credit assignment in RLVR, improving model performance and learning efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper proposes lightweight spiking Transformer models using synapse pruning and synergistic learning to reduce parameters and computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing spiking Transformer models are resource-intensive, limiting their use in constrained environments.

Method: Combines unstructured (L1P) and structured (DSP) pruning strategies with a novel sLIF neuron model for compensation.

Result: Significantly reduces model size and computational costs without compromising performance.

Conclusion: The proposed pruning and compensation strategies effectively enable efficient and high-performing spiking Transformer models.

Abstract: As a foundational architecture of artificial intelligence models, Transformer
has been recently adapted to spiking neural networks with promising performance
across various tasks. However, existing spiking Transformer (ST)-based models
require a substantial number of parameters and incur high computational costs,
thus limiting their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address
these challenges, we propose combining synapse pruning with a synergistic
learning-based compensation strategy to derive lightweight ST-based models.
Specifically, two types of tailored pruning strategies are introduced to reduce
redundancy in the weight matrices of ST blocks: an unstructured
$\mathrm{L_{1}P}$ method to induce sparse representations, and a structured DSP
method to induce low-rank representations. In addition, we propose an enhanced
spiking neuron model, termed the synergistic leaky integrate-and-fire (sLIF)
neuron, to effectively compensate for model pruning through synergistic
learning between synaptic and intrinsic plasticity mechanisms. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods
significantly reduce model size and computational overhead while maintaining
competitive performance. These results validate the effectiveness of the
proposed pruning and compensation strategies in constructing efficient and
high-performing ST-based models.

Motivation: Modern auto-bidding must balance performance with diverse advertiser goals and constraints, but existing generative methods struggle with distribution shifts and exploration limitations.

Method: GRAD integrates an Action-Mixture-of-Experts for diverse bidding actions and a Causal Transformer Value Estimator for constraint-aware optimization.

Result: GRAD increased GMV by 2.18% and ROI by 10.68% in Meituan's marketing scenarios.

Conclusion: GRAD effectively meets modern advertiser needs, demonstrating scalability and performance in real-world applications.

Abstract: Modern auto-bidding systems are required to balance overall performance with
diverse advertiser goals and real-world constraints, reflecting the dynamic and
evolving needs of the industry. Recent advances in conditional generative
models, such as transformers and diffusers, have enabled direct trajectory
generation tailored to advertiser preferences, offering a promising alternative
to traditional Markov Decision Process-based methods. However, these generative
methods face significant challenges, such as the distribution shift between
offline and online environments, limited exploration of the action space, and
the necessity to meet constraints like marginal Cost-per-Mille (CPM) and Return
on Investment (ROI). To tackle these challenges, we propose GRAD (Generative
Reward-driven Ad-bidding with Mixture-of-Experts), a scalable foundation model
for auto-bidding that combines an Action-Mixture-of-Experts module for diverse
bidding action exploration with the Value Estimator of Causal Transformer for
constraint-aware optimization. Extensive offline and online experiments
demonstrate that GRAD significantly enhances platform revenue, highlighting its
effectiveness in addressing the evolving and diverse requirements of modern
advertisers. Furthermore, GRAD has been implemented in multiple marketing
scenarios at Meituan, one of the world's largest online food delivery
platforms, leading to a 2.18% increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) and
10.68% increase in ROI.

TL;DR: A hybrid system combining LLMs and RL improves algorithmic trading by addressing myopic behavior and opaque policies, yielding better returns and risk metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To align short-term trading decisions with long-term financial goals, overcoming RL's limitations like myopic behavior and lack of transparency.

Method: LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents, evaluated via expert review and metrics like Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown.

Result: LLM-guided agents outperform standard RL in return and risk metrics.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enhances algorithmic trading by leveraging LLMs' strategic reasoning and RL's tactical execution.

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently

*Xinzheng Wu,Junyi Chen,Shaolingfeng Ye,Wei Jiang,Yong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method trains a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) to generate safety-critical scenarios for autonomous driving testing, improving efficiency and diversity without compromising fidelity or complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the generation of safety-critical scenarios in autonomous driving testing by leveraging cooperative adversarial driving characteristics between background vehicles (BVs).

Method: Uses MARL to train Dual-DM with non-adversarial and adversarial driving modalities, integrated into a simulated traffic environment for evolving scenario generation.

Result: Dual-DM achieves high fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world scenarios), improved efficiency (+195%), and maintains complexity (+32.35% and +12.5% over baselines) while demonstrating diverse adversarial interaction patterns.

Conclusion: Dual-DM significantly enhances the generation of safety-critical scenarios, proving effective for autonomous driving testing.

Abstract: In the autonomous driving testing methods based on evolving scenarios, the
construction method of the driver model, which determines the driving maneuvers
of background vehicles (BVs) in the scenario, plays a critical role in
generating safety-critical scenarios. In particular, the cooperative
adversarial driving characteristics between BVs can contribute to the efficient
generation of safety-critical scenarios with high testing value. In this paper,
a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) method is used to train and
generate a dual-modal driver model (Dual-DM) with non-adversarial and
adversarial driving modalities. The model is then connected to a continuous
simulated traffic environment to generate complex, diverse and strong
interactive safety-critical scenarios through evolving scenario generation
method. After that, the generated evolving scenarios are evaluated in terms of
fidelity, test efficiency, complexity and diversity. Results show that without
performance degradation in scenario fidelity (>85% similarity to real-world
scenarios) and complexity (complexity metric: 0.45, +32.35% and +12.5% over two
baselines), Dual-DM achieves a substantial enhancement in the efficiency of
generating safety-critical scenarios (efficiency metric: 0.86, +195% over two
baselines). Furthermore, statistical analysis and case studies demonstrate the
diversity of safety-critical evolving scenarios generated by Dual-DM in terms
of the adversarial interaction patterns. Therefore, Dual-DM can greatly improve
the performance of the generation of safety-critical scenarios through evolving
scenario generation method.

*Zhilong Zhao,Yindi Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs' reliability in qualitative coding is assessed using self-confidence and model diversity, achieving high agreement (R²=0.979) and reducing manual effort by 65%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of assessing LLM reliability in qualitative coding where human agreement is rare.

Method: Analyzed 5,680 coding decisions from eight LLMs across ten categories, using mean self-confidence and model diversity (Shannon entropy) as metrics.

Result: A dual signal of confidence and diversity explains agreement almost completely (R²=0.979), enabling a workflow that reduces manual effort by 65% with low error rates.

Conclusion: The study provides a generalizable, evidence-based criterion for calibrating AI judgment in qualitative research.

Abstract: LLMs enable qualitative coding at large scale, but assessing the reliability
of their output remains challenging in domains where human experts seldom
agree. Analysing 5,680 coding decisions from eight state-of-the-art LLMs across
ten thematic categories, we confirm that a model's mean self-confidence already
tracks inter-model agreement closely (Pearson r=0.82). Adding model
diversity-quantified as the normalised Shannon entropy of the panel's
votes-turns this single cue into a dual signal that explains agreement almost
completely (R^2=0.979). The confidence-diversity duo enables a three-tier
workflow that auto-accepts 35% of segments with <5% audit-detected error and
routes the remainder for targeted human review, cutting manual effort by up to
65%. Cross-domain replication on six public datasets spanning finance,
medicine, law and multilingual tasks confirms these gains (kappa improvements
of 0.20-0.78). Our results establish a generalisable, evidence-based criterion
for calibrating AI judgement in qualitative research.

*Sijia Wang,Ricardo Henao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for source-free transfer learning by reusing pre-trained models efficiently in both white-box and black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in transfer learning when source data is unavailable, enabling practical applications like Model as a Service (MaaS).

Method: Proposes a model recycling framework to identify and reuse subsets of related source models for parameter-efficient training.

Result: Enables multi-source data-free supervised transfer learning, benefiting MaaS providers.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for transfer learning without source data, expanding its applicability.

Abstract: Increasing concerns for data privacy and other difficulties associated with
retrieving source data for model training have created the need for source-free
transfer learning, in which one only has access to pre-trained models instead
of data from the original source domains. This setting introduces many
challenges, as many existing transfer learning methods typically rely on access
to source data, which limits their direct applicability to scenarios where
source data is unavailable. Further, practical concerns make it more difficult,
for instance efficiently selecting models for transfer without information on
source data, and transferring without full access to the source models. So
motivated, we propose a model recycling framework for parameter-efficient
training of models that identifies subsets of related source models to reuse in
both white-box and black-box settings. Consequently, our framework makes it
possible for Model as a Service (MaaS) providers to build libraries of
efficient pre-trained models, thus creating an opportunity for multi-source
data-free supervised transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the unexplored challenges of node unlearning in GNNs, avoiding retraining overhead while maintaining model utility.

Method: Proposes embedding reconstruction to reverse GNN aggregation and employs Range-Null Space Decomposition for node interaction learning.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles node unlearning in GNNs without retraining, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Graph unlearning is tailored for GNNs to handle widespread and various graph
structure unlearning requests, which remain largely unexplored. The GIF (graph
influence function) achieves validity under partial edge unlearning, but faces
challenges in dealing with more disturbing node unlearning. To avoid the
overhead of retraining and realize the model utility of unlearning, we proposed
a novel node unlearning method to reverse the process of aggregation in GNN by
embedding reconstruction and to adopt Range-Null Space Decomposition for the
nodes' interaction learning. Experimental results on multiple representative
datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of our proposed approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Epi$^2$-Net integrates physical constraints with neural networks for improved epidemic forecasting, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current epidemic forecasting models are limited by oversimplified assumptions or lack of physical constraints, leading to biased results.

Method: Proposes Epi$^2$-Net, a physics-inspired neural network framework, introducing neural epidemic transport and integrating physical constraints with neural modules.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in real-world epidemic forecasting.

Conclusion: Epi$^2$-Net offers a promising solution for accurate epidemic forecasting and containment.

Abstract: Advancing epidemic dynamics forecasting is vital for targeted interventions
and safeguarding public health. Current approaches mainly fall into two
categories: mechanism-based and data-driven models. Mechanism-based models are
constrained by predefined compartmental structures and oversimplified system
assumptions, limiting their ability to model complex real-world dynamics, while
data-driven models focus solely on intrinsic data dependencies without physical
or epidemiological constraints, risking biased or misleading representations.
Although recent studies have attempted to integrate epidemiological knowledge
into neural architectures, most of them fail to reconcile explicit physical
priors with neural representations. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce
Epi$^2$-Net, a Epidemic Forecasting Framework built upon Physics-Inspired
Neural Networks. Specifically, we propose reconceptualizing epidemic
transmission from the physical transport perspective, introducing the concept
of neural epidemic transport. Further, we present a physic-inspired deep
learning framework, and integrate physical constraints with neural modules to
model spatio-temporal patterns of epidemic dynamics. Experiments on real-world
datasets have demonstrated that Epi$^2$-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in epidemic forecasting, providing a promising solution for future
epidemic containment. The code is available at:

TL;DR: Attention sink (AS) in transformers is a fundamental geometric principle for establishing reference frames, not just an artifact. It emerges early in training and is influenced by architecture components like position encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the attention sink phenomenon in transformers and its underlying geometric principles, moving beyond viewing it as a mere architectural artifact.

Method: Analyzed various transformer architectures to identify and categorize three types of reference frames (centralized, distributed, bidirectional) linked to AS. Studied their emergence during training and the role of position encoding.

Result: Identified AS as a manifestation of reference frames in high-dimensional spaces, emerging early in training. Position encoding implementations influence the type of reference frame.

Conclusion: AS is a fundamental geometric feature in transformers, providing insights for architecture design and understanding attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

TL;DR: A novel SNN architecture integrates graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for multivariate time-series forecasting, outperforming state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of SNNs for spatial modeling in multivariate time-series forecasting, which remains largely unexplored.

Method: The architecture embeds time features and an adaptive matrix, learns sequence features via OBS Block, aggregates neighborhood information hierarchically with MSSA, and fuses spatial-temporal features using DSF Block.

Result: The model surpasses iSpikformer and traditional temporal models, especially for long sequences.

Conclusion: This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient spatial-temporal modeling using SNNs.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of
biological neurons, offer a distinctive approach for capturing the complexities
of temporal data. However, their potential for spatial modeling in multivariate
time-series forecasting remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce a brand new SNN architecture, which is among the first to seamlessly
integrate graph structural learning with spike-based temporal processing for
multivariate time-series forecasting. Specifically, we first embed time
features and an adaptive matrix, eliminating the need for predefined graph
structures. We then further learn sequence features through the Observation
(OBS) Block. Building upon this, our Multi-Scale Spike Aggregation (MSSA)
hierarchically aggregates neighborhood information through spiking SAGE layers,
enabling multi-hop feature extraction while eliminating the need for
floating-point operations. Finally, we propose a Dual-Path Spike Fusion (DSF)
Block to integrate spatial graph features and temporal dynamics via a
spike-gated mechanism, combining LSTM-processed sequences with spiking
self-attention outputs, effectively improve the model accuracy of long sequence
datasets. Experiments show that our model surpasses the state-of-the-art
SNN-based iSpikformer on all datasets and outperforms traditional temporal
models at long horizons, thereby establishing a new paradigm for efficient
spatial-temporal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT strategies do not leverage MoE's dynamic routing, prompting investigation into whether adaptation modules should incorporate routing.

Method: Analyzes PEFT application to MoE models, tests routing strategies, and conducts experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B for commonsense and math tasks.

Result: Validates the performance and efficiency of the routed approach, identifying optimal configurations for different scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides empirical insights to improve PEFT and MoE applications, emphasizing the benefits of routed adaptation.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) benefits from a dynamic routing mechanism among
their specialized experts, which existing Parameter- Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategies fail to leverage. This motivates us to investigate whether
adaptation modules themselves should incorporate routing mechanisms to align
with MoE's multi-expert architecture. We analyze dynamics of core components
when applying PEFT to MoE language models and examine how different routing
strategies affect adaptation effectiveness. Extensive experiments adapting
OLMoE-1B-7B and Mixtral-8x7B on various commonsense and math reasoning tasks
validate the performance and efficiency of our routed approach. We identify the
optimal configurations for different scenarios and provide empirical analyses
with practical insights to facilitate better PEFT and MoE applications.

*Amitava Das,Abhilekh Borah,Vinija Jain,Aman Chadha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL) mitigates alignment drift in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs by introducing task-specific and collision-aware regularization, preserving safety without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minor LoRA updates can weaken safety and behavioral constraints in LLMs, necessitating a method to preserve alignment during fine-tuning.

Method: AGL uses primary task loss, Fisher Information Matrix-based regularization, and collision-aware regularization (Riemannian overlap and geodesic separation) to stabilize updates.

Result: AGL reduces alignment drift by up to 50% on safety benchmarks while maintaining task performance, validated by the DriftCaps benchmark.

Conclusion: AGL is a principled refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal trade-offs, and is open-sourced for further development.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a standard tool for efficiently
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Yet, even minor LoRA updates can
induce alignment drift, weakening safety and behavioral constraints through
entangled parameter changes. To address this, we propose AlignGuard-LoRA (AGL),
a principled framework for preserving alignment during finetuning. AGL
introduces several key components: a primary task loss for supervision, Fisher
Information Matrix-based regularization to restrict updates in
alignment-sensitive subspaces, and task-specific regularization to stabilize
the integration of new knowledge. We further introduce collision-aware
regularization, blending Riemannian overlap -- which penalizes coordinate-wise
interference -- and geodesic separation -- which encourages disjoint update
geometry. We curate DriftCaps, a targeted diagnostic benchmark of safe and
unsafe prompts designed to quantify alignment drift and safety degradation.
Empirical evaluations show that AGL mitigates alignment drift by up to 50% on
safety-critical benchmarks without degrading downstream task performance.
Comprehensive ablation confirms that each component contributes distinctly to
preserving latent safety behaviors. Finally, we derive and validate a scaling
law for catastrophic forgetting, revealing that AGL flattens post-finetuning
loss escalation while preserving adaptation dynamics. AGL is a structurally
grounded refinement of LoRA, ensuring alignment preservation with minimal
trade-offs. To encourage further exploration and development, we open-source
our implementation.

TL;DR: A geometric framework for analyzing ML models using Riemannian simplicial complexes and differential forms, enabling regularization and diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a mathematical and geometric perspective for understanding and refining machine learning models by analyzing their partition structures.

Method: Represents partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, introduces differential forms for neural networks, and develops discrete curvature measures.

Result: Enables geometric regularization, model refinement tools, and new insights into learning dynamics through curvature measures.

Conclusion: The geometric approach offers novel methods for model interpretation, regularization, and diagnostics in machine learning.

Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for analyzing machine learning
  models through the geometry of their induced partitions. By representing
  partitions as Riemannian simplicial complexes, we capture not only adjacency
  relationships but also geometric properties including cell volumes, volumes
of
  faces where cells meet, and dihedral angles between adjacent cells. For
neural
  networks, we introduce a differential forms approach that tracks geometric
  structure through layers via pullback operations, making computations
  tractable by focusing on data-containing cells. The framework enables
  geometric regularization that directly penalizes problematic spatial
  configurations and provides new tools for model refinement through extended
  Laplacians and simplicial splines. We also explore how data distribution
  induces effective geometric curvature in model partitions, developing
discrete
  curvature measures for vertices that quantify local geometric complexity and
  statistical Ricci curvature for edges that captures pairwise relationships
  between cells. While focused on mathematical foundations, this geometric
  perspective offers new approaches to model interpretation, regularization,
and
  diagnostic tools for understanding learning dynamics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a model-based CTRL algorithm using MLE and state marginal density estimation, providing instance-dependent performance guarantees and adaptive measurement strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve CTRL's adaptability to varying problem difficulties, addressing gaps in existing approaches.

Method: A model-based algorithm using MLE with a general function approximator, estimating state marginal density instead of direct dynamics.

Result: Derived a regret bound scaling with reward variance and measurement resolution, with adaptive observation frequency.

Conclusion: The work advances CTRL by enabling automatic adaptation to environmental difficulty, improving sample efficiency.

Abstract: Continuous-time reinforcement learning (CTRL) provides a natural framework
for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments where interactions
evolve continuously over time. While CTRL has shown growing empirical success,
its ability to adapt to varying levels of problem difficulty remains poorly
understood. In this work, we investigate the instance-dependent behavior of
CTRL and introduce a simple, model-based algorithm built on maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) with a general function approximator. Unlike existing
approaches that estimate system dynamics directly, our method estimates the
state marginal density to guide learning. We establish instance-dependent
performance guarantees by deriving a regret bound that scales with the total
reward variance and measurement resolution. Notably, the regret becomes
independent of the specific measurement strategy when the observation frequency
adapts appropriately to the problem's complexity. To further improve
performance, our algorithm incorporates a randomized measurement schedule that
enhances sample efficiency without increasing measurement cost. These results
highlight a new direction for designing CTRL algorithms that automatically
adjust their learning behavior based on the underlying difficulty of the
environment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study uses an LSTM neural network to predict and reduce merging conflict risks for large trucks in work zones, outperforming baseline methods in safety metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large trucks contribute significantly to work zone crashes due to their size and blind spots, necessitating safer merging strategies.

Method: An LSTM neural network predicts merging risks, ensuring safe gaps in the target lane for conflict-free merging.

Result: The LSTM method reduces conflict risk (lower TET and TIT values) and enables early merging without stopping.

Conclusion: The LSTM-based approach enhances safety and efficiency for large truck merging in work zones compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Large trucks substantially contribute to work zone-related crashes, primarily
due to their large size and blind spots. When approaching a work zone, large
trucks often need to merge into an adjacent lane because of lane closures
caused by construction activities. This study aims to enhance the safety of
large truck merging maneuvers in work zones by evaluating the risk associated
with merging conflicts and establishing a decision-making strategy for merging
based on this risk assessment. To predict the risk of large trucks merging into
a mixed traffic stream within a work zone, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network is employed. For a large truck intending to merge, it is
critical that the immediate downstream vehicle in the target lane maintains a
minimum safe gap to facilitate a safe merging process. Once a conflict-free
merging opportunity is predicted, large trucks are instructed to merge in
response to the lane closure. Our LSTM-based conflict prediction method is
compared against baseline approaches, which include probabilistic risk-based
merging, 50th percentile gap-based merging, and 85th percentile gap-based
merging strategies. The results demonstrate that our method yields a lower
conflict risk, as indicated by reduced Time Exposed Time-to-Collision (TET) and
Time Integrated Time-to-Collision (TIT) values relative to the baseline models.
Furthermore, the findings indicate that large trucks that use our method can
perform early merging while still in motion, as opposed to coming to a complete
stop at the end of the current lane prior to closure, which is commonly
observed with the baseline approaches.

TL;DR: PTBCC introduces prototype learning to improve annotator expertise estimation in multi-class classification, addressing data sparsity and class imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using single confusion matrices are unreliable for sparse or imbalanced data and fail to capture full annotator expertise.

Method: PTBCC uses prototype confusion matrices and Dirichlet priors to model annotator expertise, enhancing flexibility and reliability.

Result: PTBCC improves accuracy by up to 15% and reduces computational cost by over 90% in experiments on 11 datasets.

Conclusion: PTBCC offers a robust, efficient solution for truth inference in multi-class classification, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-class classification annotations have significantly advanced AI
applications, with truth inference serving as a critical technique for
aggregating noisy and biased annotations. Existing state-of-the-art methods
typically model each annotator's expertise using a confusion matrix. However,
these methods suffer from two widely recognized issues: 1) when most annotators
label only a few tasks, or when classes are imbalanced, the estimated confusion
matrices are unreliable, and 2) a single confusion matrix often remains
inadequate for capturing each annotator's full expertise patterns across all
tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel confusion-matrix-based
method, PTBCC (ProtoType learning-driven Bayesian Classifier Combination), to
introduce a reliable and richer annotator estimation by prototype learning.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a set $S$ of prototype confusion
matrices, which capture the inherent expertise patterns of all annotators.
Rather than a single confusion matrix, the expertise per annotator is extended
as a Dirichlet prior distribution over these prototypes. This prototype
learning-driven mechanism circumvents the data sparsity and class imbalance
issues, ensuring a richer and more flexible characterization of annotators.
Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that PTBCC achieves
up to a 15% accuracy improvement in the best case, and a 3% higher average
accuracy while reducing computational cost by over 90%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how architectural constraints influence training dynamics, convergence, and generalization in deep networks, moving beyond empirical tweaks.

Method: Introduces enriched transformation layers with constrained pathways and adaptive corrections, analyzing their effects on gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point behavior.

Result: Demonstrates improved robustness, smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior in synthetic and structured tasks.

Conclusion: Architectural design is key for shaping learning dynamics, offering interpretable and scalable solutions for neural systems.

Abstract: While modern deep networks have demonstrated remarkable versatility, their
training dynamics remain poorly understood--often driven more by empirical
tweaks than architectural insight. This paper investigates how internal
structural choices shape the behavior of learning systems. Building on prior
efforts that introduced simple architectural constraints, we explore the
broader implications of structure for convergence, generalization, and
adaptation. Our approach centers on a family of enriched transformation layers
that incorporate constrained pathways and adaptive corrections. We analyze how
these structures influence gradient flow, spectral sensitivity, and fixed-point
behavior--uncovering mechanisms that contribute to training stability and
representational regularity. Theoretical analysis is paired with empirical
studies on synthetic and structured tasks, demonstrating improved robustness,
smoother optimization, and scalable depth behavior. Rather than prescribing
fixed templates, we emphasize principles of tractable design that can steer
learning behavior in interpretable ways. Our findings support a growing view
that architectural design is not merely a matter of performance tuning, but a
critical axis for shaping learning dynamics in scalable and trustworthy neural
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of prior weight and activation sparsity methods, which suffer from accuracy degradation or training dependency.

Method: Proposes Amber Pruner for training-free N:M activation sparsity in the prefill stage and integrates it with W8A8 quantization in Outstanding-sparse.

Result: Achieves sparsity in over 55% of linear computations without retraining, maintaining performance in downstream tasks, especially generative ones.

Conclusion: Pioneers activation sparsity for LLMs, offering insights for future AI system design.

Abstract: In the era of large language models (LLMs), N:M sparsity has emerged as a
structured compression technique critical for accelerating inference. While
prior work has primarily focused on weight sparsity, it often suffers from
significant accuracy degradation. Activation sparsity, though promising, is
typically training-dependent and faces challenges in generalization. To address
these limitations, we introduce Amber Pruner, a training-free N:M activation
sparsity method designed specifically for the prefill stage, targeting the
acceleration of linear projection layers in LLMs. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and sparsity ratios (2:4, 4:8, and 8:16) demonstrate that Amber
Pruner can effectively sparsify and accelerate more than 55% of linear
computations without requiring model retraining. To further enhance generality
and efficiency, we propose Outstanding-sparse, a unified framework that
integrates Amber Pruner with post-training W8A8 quantization. Our approach
preserves strong performance across a range of downstream tasks, with notable
advantages in generative tasks. This work pioneers a new frontier in activation
sparsity, providing foundational insights that are poised to guide the
co-evolution of algorithms and architectures in the design of next-generation
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Climate change intensifies extreme weather, posing challenges to agriculture, particularly kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.

Method: Isolation Forest, an unsupervised anomaly detection method, was used to analyze climate history, extreme events, and kiwifruit yields.

Result: Variability in yield impacts from different extreme events was found, with limitations in detecting events like frost.

Conclusion: The study calls for integrating farm management strategies with climate adaptation and proposes ensemble methods for improved detection and response strategies.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of extreme weather
events, presenting unprecedented challenges to the agricultural industry
worldwide. In this investigation, we focus on kiwifruit farming in New Zealand.
We propose to examine the impacts of climate-induced extreme events,
specifically frost, drought, extreme rainfall, and heatwave, on kiwifruit
harvest yields. These four events were selected due to their significant
impacts on crop productivity and their prevalence as recorded by climate
monitoring institutions in the country. We employed Isolation Forest, an
unsupervised anomaly detection method, to analyse climate history and recorded
extreme events, alongside with kiwifruit yields. Our analysis reveals
considerable variability in how different types of extreme event affect
kiwifruit yields underscoring notable discrepancies between climatic extremes
and individual farm's yield outcomes. Additionally, our study highlights
critical limitations of current anomaly detection approaches, particularly in
accurately identifying events such as frost. These findings emphasise the need
for integrating supplementary features like farm management strategies with

methods that consolidate nearby farms' yield data and regional climate station
features to reduce variance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of
extreme event detection and the formulation of response strategies.

*Qi Xiong,Hai Dong,Nasrin Sohrabi,Zahir Tari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLAD is a novel defence method against Sybil attacks in federated learning, using linear algebra to detect and filter malicious nodes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sybil attacks, especially targeted data poisoning, threaten federated learning by allowing malicious nodes to dominate the system. Current defences like clustering and robust training fail when malicious nodes are in the majority.

Method: FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a linear algebra problem, identifying attacks by extracting independent linear combinations and filtering malicious elements.

Result: FedLAD outperforms five baseline methods (Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, Krum) in robustness and accuracy across various malicious node ratios (0.2-0.8).

Conclusion: FedLAD enhances federated learning security and performance, proving effective against data poisoning attacks without dependency on specific applications.

Abstract: Sybil attacks pose a significant threat to federated learning, as malicious
nodes can collaborate and gain a majority, thereby overwhelming the system.
Therefore, it is essential to develop countermeasures that ensure the security
of federated learning environments. We present a novel defence method against
targeted data poisoning, which is one of the types of Sybil attacks, called
Linear Algebra-based Detection (FedLAD). Unlike existing approaches, such as
clustering and robust training, which struggle in situations where malicious
nodes dominate, FedLAD models the federated learning aggregation process as a
linear problem, transforming it into a linear algebra optimisation challenge.
This method identifies potential attacks by extracting the independent linear
combinations from the original linear combinations, effectively filtering out
redundant and malicious elements. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of FedLAD compared to five well-established
defence methods: Sherpa, CONTRA, Median, Trimmed Mean, and Krum. Using tasks
from both image classification and natural language processing, our experiments
confirm that FedLAD is robust and not dependent on specific application
settings. The results indicate that FedLAD effectively protects federated
learning systems across a broad spectrum of malicious node ratios. Compared to
baseline defence methods, FedLAD maintains a low attack success rate for
malicious nodes when their ratio ranges from 0.2 to 0.8. Additionally, it
preserves high model accuracy when the malicious node ratio is between 0.2 and
0.5. These findings underscore FedLAD's potential to enhance both the
reliability and performance of federated learning systems in the face of data
poisoning attacks.

TL;DR: AuroBind is a scalable virtual screening framework that improves atomic-level precision and binding fitness prediction, outperforming existing methods and enabling faster, high-throughput molecular screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over 96% of human proteins remain undrugged, and current virtual screening methods lack precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting their impact.

Method: AuroBind fine-tunes a custom atomic-level structural model using million-scale chemogenomic data, integrating direct preference optimization, self-distillation, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy.

Result: AuroBind outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieves 100,000-fold faster screening, and demonstrates high experimental hit rates (7-69%) with sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. It successfully identified agonists and antagonists for orphan GPCRs.

Conclusion: AuroBind bridges the gap between structure prediction and therapeutic discovery, offering a generalizable framework for high-throughput molecular screening.

Abstract: Most human proteins remain undrugged, over 96% of human proteins remain
unexploited by approved therapeutics. While structure-based virtual screening
promises to expand the druggable proteome, existing methods lack atomic-level
precision and fail to predict binding fitness, limiting translational impact.
We present AuroBind, a scalable virtual screening framework that fine-tunes a
custom atomic-level structural model on million-scale chemogenomic data.
AuroBind integrates direct preference optimization, self-distillation from
high-confidence complexes, and a teacher-student acceleration strategy to
jointly predict ligand-bound structures and binding fitness. The proposed
models outperform state-of-the-art models on structural and functional
benchmarks while enabling 100,000-fold faster screening across ultra-large
compound libraries. In a prospective screen across ten disease-relevant
targets, AuroBind achieved experimental hit rates of 7-69%, with top compounds
reaching sub-nanomolar to picomolar potency. For the orphan GPCRs GPR151 and
GPR160, AuroBind identified both agonists and antagonists with success rates of
16-30%, and functional assays confirmed GPR160 modulation in liver and prostate
cancer models. AuroBind offers a generalizable framework for structure-function
learning and high-throughput molecular screening, bridging the gap between
structure prediction and therapeutic discovery.

### [571] [Large-Scale Model Enabled Semantic Communication Based on Robust Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02148)
*Kuiyuan DIng,Caili Guo,Yang Yang,Zhongtian Du,Walid Saad*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A robust knowledge distillation-based semantic communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and noise-resistant large-scale model (LSM) deployment. It uses lightweight architecture search and two-stage distillation to optimize performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct deployment of large-scale models (LSMs) for semantic communication is hindered by high computational complexity and resource demands. The paper aims to address these challenges.

Method: The framework includes a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm and a two-stage robust knowledge distillation (RKD) algorithm. A channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced for noise resilience.

Result: Simulations show the RKD-SC framework reduces model parameters while maintaining performance and robustness, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: The RKD-SC framework effectively enables efficient and robust LSM-powered semantic communication, addressing key deployment challenges.

Abstract: Large-scale models (LSMs) can be an effective framework for semantic
representation and understanding, thereby providing a suitable tool for
designing semantic communication (SC) systems. However, their direct deployment
is often hindered by high computational complexity and resource requirements.
In this paper, a novel robust knowledge distillation based semantic
communication (RKD-SC) framework is proposed to enable efficient and
\textcolor{black}{channel-noise-robust} LSM-powered SC. The framework addresses
two key challenges: determining optimal compact model architectures and
effectively transferring knowledge while maintaining robustness against channel
noise. First, a knowledge distillation-based lightweight differentiable
architecture search (KDL-DARTS) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm
integrates knowledge distillation loss and a complexity penalty into the neural
architecture search process to identify high-performance, lightweight semantic
encoder architectures. Second, a novel two-stage robust knowledge distillation
(RKD) algorithm is developed to transfer semantic capabilities from an LSM
(teacher) to a compact encoder (student) and subsequently enhance system
robustness. To further improve resilience to channel impairments, a
channel-aware transformer (CAT) block is introduced as the channel codec,
trained under diverse channel conditions with variable-length outputs.
Extensive simulations on image classification tasks demonstrate that the RKD-SC
framework significantly reduces model parameters while preserving a high degree
of the teacher model's performance and exhibiting superior robustness compared
to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces ACPOMDPs and a model-based safe RL method using privileged information to improve safety and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of partial observability in safe reinforcement learning by leveraging privileged information.

Method: Proposes ACPOMDPs and the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, using privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in safety and task performance, with superior ease of training.

Conclusion: Incorporating privileged information via ACPOMDPs and the proposed method enhances RL safety and performance effectively.

Abstract: Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement
learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards.
Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate
the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes.
In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of
incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the
Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement
learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's
safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an
asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and
task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged
model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior
performance and ease of training.

### [573] [User Trajectory Prediction Unifying Global and Local Temporal Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02161)
*Wei Hao,Bin Chong,Ronghua Ji,Chen Hou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A trajectory prediction model combining MLP, MSCNN, and cross-attention reduces forecasting errors while maintaining inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of extracting complete temporal patterns from trajectory data with global and local information, and capturing user behavior across different time scales.

Method: Uses MLP for global temporal information, MSCNN with varying kernel sizes for local temporal information, and cross-attention to fuse both.

Result: Reduces MSE by 5.04% and MAE by 4.35% compared to ModernTCN in 12-step prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively improves trajectory prediction accuracy without compromising inference speed.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is essential for formulating proactive strategies that
anticipate user mobility and support advance preparation. Therefore, how to
reduce the forecasting error in user trajectory prediction within an acceptable
inference time arises as an interesting issue. However, trajectory data
contains both global and local temporal information, complicating the
extraction of the complete temporal pattern. Moreover, user behavior occurs
over different time scales, increasing the difficulty of capturing behavioral
patterns. To address these challenges, a trajectory prediction model based on
multilayer perceptron (MLP), multi-scale convolutional neural network (MSCNN),
and cross-attention (CA) is proposed. Specifically, MLP is used to extract the
global temporal information of each feature. In parallel, MSCNN is employed to
extract the local temporal information by modeling interactions among features
within a local temporal range. Convolutional kernels with different sizes are
used in MSCNN to capture temporal information at multiple resolutions,
enhancing the model's adaptability to different behavioral patterns. Finally,
CA is applied to fuse the global and local temporal information. Experimental
results show that our model reduces mean squared error (MSE) by 5.04% and mean
absolute error (MAE) by 4.35% compared with ModernTCN in 12-step prediction,
while maintaining similar inference time.

*Kexin Zhao,Bo Wang,Cuiying Zhao,Tongyao Wan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Multi-Treatment-DML, a framework for optimizing continuous, multi-dimensional loan treatments (e.g., credit limits, interest rates) using Double Machine Learning, addressing challenges like biased observational data and domain-specific monotonic constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing causal methods fail to handle continuous, multi-dimensional treatments in loan platforms, and randomized trials are often impractical due to risk controls and long repayment cycles.

Method: The proposed Multi-Treatment-DML leverages Double Machine Learning to debias observational data, handle continuous treatments, and enforce monotonic treatment-outcome relationships.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets show the framework's effectiveness, with online A/B tests confirming its practical superiority in loan operations.

Conclusion: Multi-Treatment-DML successfully addresses gaps in causal estimation for loan treatments, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Optimizing credit limits, interest rates, and loan terms is crucial for
managing borrower risk and lifetime value (LTV) in personal loan platform.
However, counterfactual estimation of these continuous, multi-dimensional
treatments faces significant challenges: randomized trials are often prohibited
by risk controls and long repayment cycles, forcing reliance on biased
observational data. Existing causal methods primarily handle binary/discrete
treatments and struggle with continuous, multi-dimensional settings.
Furthermore, financial domain knowledge mandates provably monotonic
treatment-outcome relationships (e.g., risk increases with credit limit).To
address these gaps, we propose Multi-Treatment-DML, a novel framework
leveraging Double Machine Learning (DML) to: (i) debias observational data for
causal effect estimation; (ii) handle arbitrary-dimensional continuous
treatments; and (iii) enforce monotonic constraints between treatments and
outcomes, guaranteeing adherence to domain requirements.Extensive experiments
on public benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, online A/B testing conducted on a
realworld personal loan platform, confirms the practical superiority of
Multi-Treatment-DML in real-world loan operations.

*Manh Nguyen,Sunil Gupta,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A context-aware adaptive decoding method improves truthfulness in LLMs by leveraging a compact reference grounding space, outperforming baselines on benchmarks like TruthfulQA, Biographies, and WikiQA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of truthfulness in LLMs without requiring extensive annotated data or computational resources.

Method: Uses a compact reference grounding space (10 annotated examples) to retrieve and aggregate next token logits during decoding, modifying LLM outputs.

Result: Achieves 2.8% improvement on TruthfulQA and outperforms baselines on Biographies and WikiQA, with cross-task generalization.

Conclusion: The method is model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient, showcasing the potential of context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

Abstract: Ensuring truthfulness in large language models remains a critical challenge
for reliable text generation. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning with human feedback have shown promise, they require substantial
amount of annotated data and computational resources, limiting scalability. In
contrast, decoding-time interventions offer lightweight alternatives without
model retraining. However, existing decoding strategies often face issues like
prompt sensitivity, limited generalization, or dependence on internal model
states. We propose a context-aware adaptive decoding method that leverages a
compact reference grounding space, built from as few as 10 annotated examples
and comprising pairs of context embeddings and next token logits from truthful
responses, to enable retrieval-based logit shaping during inference. At each
decoding step, our method retrieves top-N semantically similar contexts and
aggregates their associated next token logits to modify the LLM's logits.
Across three open-ended question-answering benchmarks, our approach achieves a
2.8 percent average improvement on TruthfulQA and further outperforms existing
baselines on both Biographies and WikiQA. Experimental results also demonstrate
cross-task generalization, with TruthfulQA-derived grounding enhancing
biography generation. Our model-agnostic, scalable, and efficient method
requires only a single generation pass, highlighting the potential of
context-aware decoding for factual reliability in LLMs.

*Yigit Turkmen,Baturalp Buyukates,Melih Bastopcu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A networked LLM system with specialized models improves response accuracy and timeliness, outperforming individual LLMs, especially when models have similar standalone performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of large LLMs (data, resources, energy) by leveraging smaller, specialized models aggregated for better performance.

Method: Use a networked system with users, a task processor, and topic-specialized LLM clusters to route and aggregate binary queries.

Result: Aggregated responses achieve higher accuracy than individual LLMs, with greater improvement when models perform similarly.

Conclusion: Specialized, aggregated LLMs offer a practical and efficient alternative to large LLMs, balancing accuracy and timeliness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed many
fields including scientific discovery, content generation, biomedical text
mining, and educational technology. However, the substantial requirements for
training data, computational resources, and energy consumption pose significant
challenges for their practical deployment. A promising alternative is to
leverage smaller, specialized language models and aggregate their outputs to
improve overall response quality. In this work, we investigate a networked LLM
system composed of multiple users, a central task processor, and clusters of
topic-specialized LLMs. Each user submits categorical binary (true/false)
queries, which are routed by the task processor to a selected cluster of $m$
LLMs. After gathering individual responses, the processor returns a final
aggregated answer to the user. We characterize both the information accuracy
and response timeliness in this setting, and formulate a joint optimization
problem to balance these two competing objectives. Our extensive simulations
demonstrate that the aggregated responses consistently achieve higher accuracy
than those of individual LLMs. Notably, this improvement is more significant
when the participating LLMs exhibit similar standalone performance.

*Zeyu Zhao,Yueling Che,Kaichen Liu,Jian Li,Junmei Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking (MPFT) framework for multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), improving efficiency and reducing interactions compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-policy (MP) methods in MORL are sample-inefficient and computationally heavy due to reliance on evolutionary frameworks and large policy populations.

Method: The MPFT framework avoids evolutionary methods, using four stages: approximating Pareto-vertex policies, tracking the Pareto front, filling sparse regions, and combining policies for final approximation.

Result: MPFT outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in hypervolume performance on robotic control tasks, with fewer interactions and lower hardware demands.

Conclusion: MPFT offers a more efficient and scalable solution for MORL, reducing computational costs while maintaining high-quality Pareto front approximations.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) plays a pivotal role in
addressing multi-criteria decision-making problems in the real world. The
multi-policy (MP) based methods are widely used to obtain high-quality Pareto
front approximation for the MORL problems. However, traditional MP methods only
rely on the online reinforcement learning (RL) and adopt the evolutionary
framework with a large policy population. This may lead to sample inefficiency
and/or overwhelmed agent-environment interactions in practice. By forsaking the
evolutionary framework, we propose the novel Multi-policy Pareto Front Tracking
(MPFT) framework without maintaining any policy population, where both online
and offline MORL algorithms can be applied. The proposed MPFT framework
includes four stages: Stage 1 approximates all the Pareto-vertex policies,
whose mapping to the objective space fall on the vertices of the Pareto front.
Stage 2 designs the new Pareto tracking mechanism to track the Pareto front,
starting from each of the Pareto-vertex policies. Stage 3 identifies the sparse
regions in the tracked Pareto front, and introduces a new objective weight
adjustment method to fill the sparse regions. Finally, by combining all the
policies tracked in Stages 2 and 3, Stage 4 approximates the Pareto front.
Experiments are conducted on seven different continuous-action robotic control
tasks with both online and offline MORL algorithms, and demonstrate the
superior hypervolume performance of our proposed MPFT approach over the
state-of-the-art benchmarks, with significantly reduced agent-environment
interactions and hardware requirements.

*Sangjun Park,Tony Q. S. Quek,Hyowoon Seo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pigeon-SL introduces a robust split learning framework using the pigeonhole principle to isolate malicious clients, ensuring model accuracy and resilience against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split learning (SL) is vulnerable to malicious clients, which can degrade model accuracy. Pigeon-SL addresses this by guaranteeing at least one honest cluster among clients.

Method: Clients are partitioned into N+1 clusters per round, trained independently via SL, and evaluated on validation loss. Only the best-performing cluster advances, discarding malicious updates. Pigeon-SL+ enhances efficiency by repeating training on the selected cluster.

Result: Pigeon-SL significantly improves accuracy and resilience under label flipping, activation, and gradient manipulation attacks compared to baseline SL methods.

Conclusion: Pigeon-SL offers a robust and efficient solution for privacy-preserving distributed learning, enhancing security in future wireless networks.

Abstract: Recent advances in split learning (SL) have established it as a promising
framework for privacy-preserving, communication-efficient distributed learning
at the network edge. However, SL's sequential update process is vulnerable to
even a single malicious client, which can significantly degrade model accuracy.
To address this, we introduce Pigeon-SL, a novel scheme grounded in the
pigeonhole principle that guarantees at least one entirely honest cluster among
M clients, even when up to N of them are adversarial. In each global round, the
access point partitions the clients into N+1 clusters, trains each cluster
independently via vanilla SL, and evaluates their validation losses on a shared
dataset. Only the cluster with the lowest loss advances, thereby isolating and
discarding malicious updates. We further enhance training and communication
efficiency with Pigeon-SL+, which repeats training on the selected cluster to
match the update throughput of standard SL. We validate the robustness and
effectiveness of our approach under three representative attack models -- label
flipping, activation and gradient manipulation -- demonstrating significant
improvements in accuracy and resilience over baseline SL methods in future
intelligent wireless networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based framework for shortest path search on generic graphs, using a skeleton graph and neural network to improve efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (Dijkstra's, A*, index-based, or learning-based) are inefficient, storage-heavy, or limited to specific graph types.

Method: Constructs a skeleton graph for multi-level distance/hop info, trains a Skeleton Graph Neural Network (SGNN) for embeddings, and uses guided search (LSearch/HLSearch) with model-driven pruning.

Result: Achieves strong performance on diverse real-world graphs, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: Proposes a flexible, effective learning-based solution for shortest path search on generic graphs.

Abstract: Shortest path search is a core operation in graph-based applications, yet
existing methods face important limitations. Classical algorithms such as
Dijkstra's and A* become inefficient as graphs grow more complex, while
index-based techniques often require substantial preprocessing and storage.
Recent learning-based approaches typically focus on spatial graphs and rely on
context-specific features like geographic coordinates, limiting their general
applicability. We propose a versatile learning-based framework for shortest
path search on generic graphs, without requiring domain-specific features. At
the core of our approach is the construction of a skeleton graph that captures
multi-level distance and hop information in a compact form. A Skeleton Graph
Neural Network (SGNN) operates on this structure to learn node embeddings and
predict distances and hop lengths between node pairs. These predictions support
LSearch, a guided search algorithm that uses model-driven pruning to reduce the
search space while preserving accuracy. To handle larger graphs, we introduce a
hierarchical training strategy that partitions the graph into subgraphs with
individually trained SGNNs. This structure enables HLSearch, an extension of
our method for efficient path search across graph partitions. Experiments on
five diverse real-world graphs demonstrate that our framework achieves strong
performance across graph types, offering a flexible and effective solution for
learning-based shortest path search.

Motivation: Addressing class imbalance in insurance fraud prediction to enhance model performance and escape local minima.

Method: Proposes a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism refining focus on hard samples across training epochs.

Result: Outperforms traditional focal loss in accuracy, precision, F1-score, recall, and AUC on a real-world dataset.

Conclusion: The multistage focal loss boosts robustness and accuracy in skewed classification, with implications for fraud detection systems.

Abstract: In insurance fraud prediction, handling class imbalance remains a critical
challenge. This paper presents a novel multistage focal loss function designed
to enhance the performance of machine learning models in such imbalanced
settings by helping to escape local minima and converge to a good solution.
Building upon the foundation of the standard focal loss, our proposed approach
introduces a dynamic, multi-stage convex and nonconvex mechanism that
progressively adjusts the focus on hard-to-classify samples across training
epochs. This strategic refinement facilitates more stable learning and improved
discrimination between fraudulent and legitimate cases. Through extensive
experimentation on a real-world insurance dataset, our method achieved better
performance than the traditional focal loss, as measured by accuracy,
precision, F1-score, recall and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics on the auto
insurance dataset. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the multistage
focal loss in boosting model robustness and predictive accuracy in highly
skewed classification tasks, offering significant implications for fraud
detection systems in the insurance industry. An explainable model is included
to interpret the results.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAIR-Pruner is a novel structured pruning method for neural networks that automatically identifies and removes redundant units using Wasserstein distance and Taylor expansion, achieving efficient compression without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable deployment of large neural networks on edge devices by reducing computational and memory overhead through effective pruning.

Method: FAIR-Pruner evaluates unit importance via Wasserstein distance (Utilization Score), computes Reconstruction Error via Taylor expansion, and uses Tolerance of Difference to identify superfluous units. It automatically determines layer-wise pruning rates.

Result: Achieves significant model compression while maintaining high accuracy on benchmarks like ImageNet and architectures like VGG, without needing fine-tuning.

Conclusion: FAIR-Pruner offers an efficient, flexible, and automatic pruning solution for neural networks, balancing compression and performance.

Abstract: Neural network pruning is a critical compression technique that facilitates
the deployment of large-scale neural networks on resource-constrained edge
devices, typically by identifying and eliminating redundant or insignificant
parameters to reduce computational and memory overhead. This paper proposes the
Flexible Automatic Identification and Removal (FAIR)-Pruner, a novel method for
neural network structured pruning. Specifically, FAIR-Pruner first evaluates
the importance of each unit (e.g., neuron or channel) through the Utilization
Score quantified by the Wasserstein distance. To reflect the performance
degradation after unit removal, it then introduces the Reconstruction Error,
which is computed via the Taylor expansion of the loss function. Finally,
FAIR-Pruner identifies superfluous units with negligible impact on model
performance by controlling the proposed Tolerance of Difference, which measures
differences between unimportant units and those that cause performance
degradation. A major advantage of FAIR-Pruner lies in its capacity to
automatically determine the layer-wise pruning rates, which yields a more
efficient subnetwork structure compared to applying a uniform pruning rate.
Another advantage of the FAIR-Pruner is its great one-shot performance without
post-pruning fine-tuning. Furthermore, with utilization scores and
reconstruction errors, users can flexibly obtain pruned models under different
pruning ratios. Comprehensive experimental validation on diverse benchmark
datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and various neural network architectures (e.g., VGG)
demonstrates that FAIR-Pruner achieves significant model compression while
maintaining high accuracy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Synthetic data can replace real flight data for training ML models in aviation, retaining 94-97% predictive performance while preserving confidentiality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restricted access to real flight data hinders predictive model development; synthetic data offers a solution.

Method: Evaluated four synthetic data generators using TSTR on 1.7M flight records for three tasks: turnaround time, departure/arrival delays.

Result: Transformer-based generators achieved 94-97% real-data performance, preserving feature importance.

Conclusion: High-quality synthetic data enables aviation analytics while protecting confidentiality, but pre-tactical accuracy is inherently limited.

Abstract: Access to comprehensive flight operations data remains severely restricted in
aviation due to commercial sensitivity and competitive considerations,
hindering the development of predictive models for operational planning. This
paper investigates whether synthetic data can effectively replace real
operational data for training machine learning models in pre-tactical aviation
scenarios-predictions made hours to days before operations using only scheduled
flight information. We evaluate four state-of-the-art synthetic data generators
on three prediction tasks: aircraft turnaround time, departure delays, and
arrival delays. Using a Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR) methodology on
over 1.7 million European flight records, we first validate synthetic data
quality through fidelity assessments, then assess both predictive performance
and the preservation of operational relationships. Our results show that
advanced neural network architectures, specifically transformer-based
generators, can retain 94-97% of real-data predictive performance while
maintaining feature importance patterns informative for operational
decision-making. Our analysis reveals that even with real data, prediction
accuracy is inherently limited when only scheduled information is
available-establishing realistic baselines for pre-tactical forecasting. These
findings suggest that high-quality synthetic data can enable broader access to
aviation analytics capabilities while preserving commercial confidentiality,
though stakeholders must maintain realistic expectations about pre-tactical
prediction accuracy given the stochastic nature of flight operations.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DE-SNE, a DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, and NMS, a near-memory computing system, to address generalization and energy issues in DNN training on edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training DNNs on edge devices faces challenges like high energy consumption and generalization issues due to reliance on large datasets and DNN-based sample evaluation.

Method: Proposes DE-SNE for DNN-free sample selection and NMS for near-memory computing to reduce DDR energy consumption.

Result: NMS outperforms SOTA methods (DQ, DQAS, NeSSA) in model accuracy while reducing energy use.

Conclusion: NMS is the first DNN-free near-memory sampling technique, effectively improving generalization and energy efficiency for edge DNN training.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has attracted increasing
attention due to its potential to address challenges related to domain
adaptation and privacy preservation. However, DNNs typically rely on large
datasets for training, which results in substantial energy consumption, making
the training in edge devices impractical. Some dataset compression methods have
been proposed to solve this challenge. For instance, the coreset selection and
dataset distillation reduce the training cost by selecting and generating
representative samples respectively. Nevertheless, these methods have two
significant defects: (1) The necessary of leveraging a DNN model to evaluate
the quality of representative samples, which inevitably introduces inductive
bias of DNN, resulting in a severe generalization issue; (2) All training
images require multiple accesses to the DDR via long-distance PCB connections,
leading to substantial energy overhead. To address these issues, inspired by
the nonlinear manifold stationary of the human brain, we firstly propose a
DNN-free sample-selecting algorithm, called DE-SNE, to improve the
generalization issue. Secondly, we innovatively utilize the near-memory
computing technique to implement DE-SNE, thus only a small fraction of images
need to access the DDR via long-distance PCB. It significantly reduces DDR
energy consumption. As a result, we build a novel expedited DNN training system
with a more efficient in-place Near-Memory Sampling characteristic for edge
devices, dubbed NMS. As far as we know, our NMS is the first DNN-free
near-memory sampling technique that can effectively alleviate generalization
issues and significantly reduce DDR energy caused by dataset access. The
experimental results show that our NMS outperforms the current state-of-the-art
(SOTA) approaches, namely DQ, DQAS, and NeSSA, in model accuracy.

### [584] [A Compression Based Classification Framework Using Symbolic Dynamics of Chaotic Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02330)
*Parth Naik,Harikrishnan N B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel classification framework, ChaosComp, combines symbolic dynamics and data compression with chaotic maps for efficient class-specific modeling and competitive performance on datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reinterpret classification through dynamical systems and compression, foundational in learning theory, rather than achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: Symbolic sequences from thresholded training data are evolved via chaotic maps, forming class-specific probabilistic models. Testing uses back iteration for encoding, predicting the class with the shortest compressed representation.

Result: Competitive performance on synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., Breast Cancer Wisconsin F1-score = 0.9531).

Conclusion: ChaosComp successfully integrates dynamical systems and compression for classification, offering a fresh perspective on learning theory.

Abstract: We propose a novel classification framework grounded in symbolic dynamics and
data compression using chaotic maps. The core idea is to model each class by
generating symbolic sequences from thresholded real-valued training data, which
are then evolved through a one-dimensional chaotic map. For each class, we
compute the transition probabilities of symbolic patterns (e.g., `00', `01',
`10', and `11' for the second return map) and aggregate these statistics to
form a class-specific probabilistic model. During testing phase, the test data
are thresholded and symbolized, and then encoded using the class-wise symbolic
statistics via back iteration, a dynamical reconstruction technique. The
predicted label corresponds to the class yielding the shortest compressed
representation, signifying the most efficient symbolic encoding under its
respective chaotic model. This approach fuses concepts from dynamical systems,
symbolic representations, and compression-based learning. We evaluate the
proposed method: \emph{ChaosComp} on both synthetic and real-world datasets,
demonstrating competitive performance compared to traditional machine learning
algorithms (e.g., macro F1-scores for the proposed method on Breast Cancer
Wisconsin = 0.9531, Seeds = 0.9475, Iris = 0.8317 etc.). Rather than aiming for
state-of-the-art performance, the goal of this research is to reinterpret the
classification problem through the lens of dynamical systems and compression,
which are foundational perspectives in learning theory and information
processing.

### [585] [BOOST: Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition Function Selection Technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02332)
*Joon-Hyun Park,Mujin Cheon,Dong-Yeun Koh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOOST automates the selection of optimal kernel and acquisition function pairs in Bayesian optimization, improving performance over manual or heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO) heavily depends on hyperparameter selection, but manual or heuristic choices often lead to inefficiency.

Method: BOOST uses an offline evaluation stage to test kernel-acquisition pairs on reference data, selecting the best configuration for future optimization.

Result: BOOST outperforms standard BO with fixed hyperparameters in synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: BOOST provides a robust and automated solution for hyperparameter selection in BO, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient
method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the
selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition
functions. This presents a challenge: an inappropriate combination of these can
lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements
to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and
acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have
been explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair of these
fundamental hyperparameters has been overlooked. This forces practitioners to
rely on heuristics or costly manual training. We propose a simple yet effective
framework, BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition
Function Selection Technique), that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a
lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various
kernel-acquisition function pairs and identify the most suitable configuration
before expensive evaluations. BOOST partitions data-in-hand into two subsets: a
reference subset and a query subset, and it prepares all possible
kernel-acquisition pairs from the user's chosen candidates. For each
configuration, BOOST conducts internal BO runs using the reference subset,
evaluating how effectively each pair guides the search toward the optimum in
the unknown query subset, thereby identifying the configuration with the best
retrospective performance for future optimization. Experiments on both
synthetic benchmark functions and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks
demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO approaches with
fixed hyperparameters, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse
problem landscapes.

*Väinö Yrjänäinen,Isac Boström,Måns Magnusson,Johan Jonasson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes scalable methods (Gibbs sampler with Polya-Gamma augmentation and Laplace approximation) for quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings, comparing them with existing methods (MFVI and HMC). It addresses non-identifiability and demonstrates improved performance on real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Bayesian methods for word embeddings are either computationally infeasible or rely on restrictive assumptions, limiting reliable uncertainty quantification.

Method: Proposes a scalable Gibbs sampler with Polya-Gamma augmentation and Laplace approximation, comparing them with MFVI and HMC.

Result: Gibbs sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI fails. Laplace approximation works only for large samples. Posterior mean improves over MAP estimates, especially for smaller samples.

Conclusion: Posterior sampling (e.g., Gibbs sampler) is crucial for reliable uncertainty quantification and improved performance in word embeddings.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in word embeddings is crucial for reliable inference
from textual data. However, existing Bayesian methods such as Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) and mean-field variational inference (MFVI) are either
computationally infeasible for large data or rely on restrictive assumptions.
  We propose a scalable Gibbs sampler using Polya-Gamma augmentation as well as
Laplace approximation and compare them with MFVI and HMC for word embeddings.
In addition, we address non-identifiability in word embeddings. Our Gibbs
sampler and HMC correctly estimate uncertainties, while MFVI does not, and
Laplace approximation only does so on large sample sizes, as expected. Applying
the Gibbs sampler to the US Congress and the Movielens datasets, we demonstrate
the feasibility on larger real data. Finally, as a result of having draws from
the full posterior, we show that the posterior mean of word embeddings improves
over maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in terms of hold-out likelihood,
especially for smaller sampling sizes, further strengthening the need for
posterior sampling of word embeddings.

### [587] [MicroMix: Efficient Mixed-Precision Quantization with Microscaling Formats for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02343)
*Wenyuan Liu,Haoqian Meng,Yilun Luo,Peng Zhang,Xindian Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MicroMix is a mixed-precision quantization algorithm and kernel for LLMs, optimized for NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture, achieving faster execution and better efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing INT4-based kernels don't fully utilize the FP4 Tensor Cores in Blackwell, leading to inefficiencies.

Method: Co-designed mixed-precision quantization (MicroMix) using Microscaling (MX) formats (MXFP4/6/8) with selective precision allocation based on quantization thresholds.

Result: 20% faster execution than TensorRT-FP8, improved prefill latency, and memory efficiency across models like Llama and Qwen.

Conclusion: MicroMix bridges the gap in exploiting Blackwell's FP4 capabilities, offering superior performance in diverse tasks.

Abstract: Quantization significantly accelerates inference in large language models
(LLMs) by replacing original high-precision matrices with low-precision
counterparts. Recent advances in weight-activation quantization have primarily
focused on mapping both weights and activations to the INT4 format. Although
the new FP4 Tensor Cores in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture offer up to 4x
speedup over FP16, existing INT4-based kernels fail to fully exploit this
capability due to mismatched data formats. To bridge this gap, we propose
MicroMix, a co-designed mixed-precision quantization algorithm and matrix
multiplication kernel based on Microscaling (MX) data formats. Tailored for the
Blackwell architecture, the MicroMix kernel supports arbitrary combinations of
MXFP4, MXFP6, and MXFP8 channels, and produces BFloat16 outputs. To achieve a
favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency for each linear layer, we
introduce quantization thresholds that identify activation elements where
lower-precision formats (MXFP4 or MXFP6) incur excessive quantization error.
Our algorithm selectively allocates higher-precision channels to preserve
accuracy while maintaining compute efficiency. MicroMix achieves competitive or
superior performance across diverse downstream tasks, including zero-shot and
few-shot learning, language modeling, code generation, and mathematical
reasoning. On both consumer-grade (RTX 5070Ti laptop) and server-grade (RTX
5090) GPUs, our kernel delivers at least 20% faster execution than
TensorRT-FP8. Furthermore, when applied to various Llama and Qwen models,
MicroMix consistently improves prefill latency and memory efficiency across a
range of batch sizes compared to TensorRT baselines. Our code is available at
https://github.com/lwy2020/MicroMix.

### [588] [A Novel Sliced Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02364)
*Moritz Piening,Robert Beinert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel slicing technique for Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) and fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) distances is introduced to reduce computational effort while preserving invariance to isometric transformations and enabling comparisons of arbitrary geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The computational challenge and limitations of existing sliced versions of GW, such as restriction to Euclidean geometry and loss of isometric invariance, motivate the development of a more versatile and efficient method.

Method: The proposed method uses a lower bound, hierarchical optimal transport (OT), and quadrature rules for 1D OT problems to create a sliced version of GW and FGW.

Result: The new sliced FGW distance is computationally efficient, invariant to isometric transformations, and applicable to arbitrary geometries. It also defines a pseudo-metric and bounds FGW from below.

Conclusion: The novel sliced distance is more numerically robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW, particularly for shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

Abstract: The Gromov--Wasserstein (GW) distance and its fused extension (FGW) are
powerful tools for comparing heterogeneous data. Their computation is, however,
challenging since both distances are based on non-convex, quadratic optimal
transport (OT) problems. Leveraging 1D OT, a sliced version of GW has been
proposed to lower the computational burden. Unfortunately, this sliced version
is restricted to Euclidean geometry and loses invariance to isometries,
strongly limiting its application in practice. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel slicing technique for GW as well as for FGW that is based on an
appropriate lower bound, hierarchical OT, and suitable quadrature rules for the
underlying 1D OT problems. Our novel sliced FGW significantly reduces the
numerical effort while remaining invariant to isometric transformations and
allowing the comparison of arbitrary geometries. We show that our new distance
actually defines a pseudo-metric for structured spaces that bounds FGW from
below and study its interpolation properties between sliced Wasserstein and GW.
Since we avoid the underlying quadratic program, our sliced distance is
numerically more robust and reliable than the original GW and FGW distance;
especially in the context of shape retrieval and graph isomorphism testing.

### [589] [Beyond Manually Designed Pruning Policies with Second-Level Performance Prediction: A Pruning Framework for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02381)
*Zuxin Ma,Yunhe Cui,Yongbin Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPF (Predictive Pruning Framework) is a novel pruning framework for LLMs that uses second-level performance prediction to eliminate manual design dependencies, enabling real-time pruning decisions and significantly speeding up policy evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing non-uniform pruning methods rely on manual policies and suffer from time-consuming evaluations, limiting adaptability to dynamic pruning scenarios.

Method: PPF employs an agent for adaptive pruning actions and a lightweight performance predictor for rapid policy evaluation, reducing latency from minutes to seconds.

Result: PPF reduces perplexity by up to 33.4% (dynamic) and 84.78% (static) over existing methods, with prediction error < 0.0011 and over 64x speedup in evaluation.

Conclusion: PPF outperforms manual pruning policies, offering efficient, dynamic, and static pruning for LLMs with high accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Non-uniform structured network pruning methods can effectively reduce Large
Language Model (LLM) size by eliminating redundant channels or layers, offering
lower performance degradation than uniform strategies. However, existing
non-uniform methods rely heavily on manually designed pruning policies (e.g.,
layer importance and scaling factors), and therefore cannot efficiently adapt
to scenarios with dynamic pruning ratio requirements. Additionly, a critical
bottleneck -- the time-consuming evaluation of pruning policies -- further
limits the feasibility of iteratively and dynamically finding optimal pruning
policies. To address these limitations, we propose PPF (Predictive Pruning
Framework), a novel pruning framework for LLMs that eliminates manual design
dependencies via second-level performance prediction. PPF not only supports
real-time pruning decisions under dynamic pruning ratios but is also applicable
to static pruning scenarios. It employs an agent for producing adaptive and
real-time pruning actions, while a lightweight performance predictor that can
evaluate a pruning policy in seconds, significantly speeding up the iterative
optimization process. Experiments on Llama2-7B and Llama3-8B show that PPF can
generate dynamic/static pruning policies and it reduces perplexity by up to
33.4% (dynamic pruning) and 84.78% (static pruning) over existing methods,
outperforming manually designed pruning policies. The performance predictor
achieves second-level performance prediction with high accuracy (prediction
error < 0.0011). It reduces the mean evaluation latency from minute-level (1
minute and 38.02 seconds of test-set evaluation methods) to second-level (1.52
second), achieving over 64 times speedup. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Ma-zx/PPF .

*Changjie Sheng,Zhichao Zhang,Wei Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEFRFE, a spectral graph embedding method using graph fractional Fourier transform to enhance expressiveness and capture latent structural features. It outperforms traditional methods in classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional spectral embedding methods lack expressiveness and fail to capture latent structural features across transform domains.

Method: Extends GEFFE using graph fractional Fourier transform, introducing GEFRFE with fractional domain filtering and nonlinear eigenvector composition. Uses search-based optimization and ResNet18 for adaptive fractional order determination.

Result: GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly improves classification performance on six benchmark datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GEFRFE is a promising enhancement to spectral graph embedding, offering improved informativeness and performance without increasing computational complexity.

Abstract: Spectral graph embedding plays a critical role in graph representation
learning by generating low-dimensional vector representations from graph
spectral information. However, the embedding space of traditional spectral
embedding methods often exhibit limited expressiveness, failing to exhaustively
capture latent structural features across alternative transform domains. To
address this issue, we use the graph fractional Fourier transform to extend the
existing state-of-the-art generalized frequency filtering embedding (GEFFE)
into fractional domains, giving birth to the generalized fractional filtering
embedding (GEFRFE), which enhances embedding informativeness via the graph
fractional domain. The GEFRFE leverages graph fractional domain filtering and a
nonlinear composition of eigenvector components derived from a fractionalized
graph Laplacian. To dynamically determine the fractional order, two parallel
strategies are introduced: search-based optimization and a ResNet18-based
adaptive learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the GEFRFE captures richer structural features and significantly enhance
classification performance. Notably, the proposed method retains computational
complexity comparable to GEFFE approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASMR is a novel method for detecting and excluding malfunctioning clients in Federated Learning without needing hyperparameters or prior knowledge of malfunctioning clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FL defense mechanisms are impractical due to unrealistic prerequisites like knowing the number of malfunctioning updates.

Method: ASMR dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on their angular distance, requiring no hyperparameters or prior knowledge.

Result: ASMR effectively detects malfunctioning clients in an image classification task on a histopathological dataset.

Conclusion: ASMR offers a practical solution for FL resilience by dynamically adapting decision boundaries without impractical prerequisites.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows the training of deep neural networks in a
distributed and privacy-preserving manner. However, this concept suffers from
malfunctioning updates sent by the attending clients that cause global model
performance degradation. Reasons for this malfunctioning might be technical
issues, disadvantageous training data, or malicious attacks. Most of the
current defense mechanisms are meant to require impractical prerequisites like
knowledge about the number of malfunctioning updates, which makes them
unsuitable for real-world applications. To counteract these problems, we
introduce a novel method called Angular Support for Malfunctioning Client
Resilience (ASMR), that dynamically excludes malfunctioning clients based on
their angular distance. Our novel method does not require any hyperparameters
or knowledge about the number of malfunctioning clients. Our experiments
showcase the detection capabilities of ASMR in an image classification task on
a histopathological dataset, while also presenting findings on the significance
of dynamically adapting decision boundaries.

*Khoa Tuan Nguyen,Gaeun Oh,Ho-min Park,Francesca Tozzi,Wouter Willaert,Joris Vankerschaver,Niki Rashidian,Wesley De Neve*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes using classical ML and PointNet to evaluate the quality of synthetic 3D liver shapes, offering interpretable and complementary insights to expert reviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating the quality of 3D medical shapes is challenging due to the lack of ground truth and reliance on labor-intensive expert reviews.

Method: Point clouds from generated liver shapes are sampled, geometric features are extracted, and ML/PointNet models are trained to classify shapes as good or bad.

Result: ML-based classifiers provide interpretable feedback and complementary insights to expert evaluation.

Conclusion: ML classifiers can serve as lightweight, task-relevant quality metrics for 3D organ shape generation, improving evaluation transparency and clinical alignment.

Abstract: While 3D medical shape generative models such as diffusion models have shown
promise in synthesizing diverse and anatomically plausible structures, the
absence of ground truth makes quality evaluation challenging. Existing
evaluation metrics commonly measure distributional distances between training
and generated sets, while the medical field requires assessing quality at the
individual level for each generated shape, which demands labor-intensive expert
review.
  In this paper, we investigate the use of classical machine learning (ML)
methods and PointNet as an alternative, interpretable approach for assessing
the quality of generated liver shapes. We sample point clouds from the surfaces
of the generated liver shapes, extract handcrafted geometric features, and
train a group of supervised ML and PointNet models to classify liver shapes as
good or bad. These trained models are then used as proxy discriminators to
assess the quality of synthetic liver shapes produced by generative models.
  Our results show that ML-based shape classifiers provide not only
interpretable feedback but also complementary insights compared to expert
evaluation. This suggests that ML classifiers can serve as lightweight,
task-relevant quality metrics in 3D organ shape generation, supporting more
transparent and clinically aligned evaluation protocols in medical shape
modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for Federated Graph Learning (FGL) addresses the right to be forgotten by offering robust mechanisms for selective and wholesale data removal, improving accuracy and unlearning effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for data privacy and adherence to the right to be forgotten in decentralized systems like FGL, where existing methods fail to fully remove data or residual knowledge.

Method: A bifurcated strategy: fine-grained Meta Unlearning uses prototype gradients and adversarial graphs for local forgetting, while complete client unlearning relies solely on adversarial graph generation.

Result: The framework outperforms existing methods in accuracy for both client and meta-unlearning scenarios and enhances other methods as a plug-in module.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a comprehensive solution for data removal in FGL, improving both unlearning effectiveness and model performance.

Abstract: The demand for data privacy has led to the development of frameworks like
Federated Graph Learning (FGL), which facilitate decentralized model training.
However, a significant operational challenge in such systems is adhering to the
right to be forgotten. This principle necessitates robust mechanisms for two
distinct types of data removal: the selective erasure of specific entities and
their associated knowledge from local subgraphs and the wholesale removal of a
user's entire dataset and influence. Existing methods often struggle to fully
address both unlearning requirements, frequently resulting in incomplete data
removal or the persistence of residual knowledge within the system. This work
introduces a unified framework, conceived to provide a comprehensive solution
to these challenges. The proposed framework employs a bifurcated strategy
tailored to the specific unlearning request. For fine-grained Meta Unlearning,
it uses prototype gradients to direct the initial local forgetting process,
which is then refined by generating adversarial graphs to eliminate any
remaining data traces among affected clients. In the case of complete client
unlearning, the framework utilizes adversarial graph generation exclusively to
purge the departed client's contributions from the remaining network. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the proposed approach. The
framework achieves substantial improvements in model prediction accuracy across
both client and meta-unlearning scenarios when compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, additional studies confirm its utility as a plug-in module, where
it materially enhances the predictive capabilities and unlearning effectiveness
of other established methods.

*Kunyu Zhang,Lin Gu,Liangchen Liu,Yingke Chen,Bingyang Wang,Jin Yan,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses label noise in medical image datasets caused by expert uncertainty in clinical notes, proposing a new benchmark and label smoothing method to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for creating medical image datasets from clinical notes ignore expert uncertainty, leading to noisy labels. This work aims to incorporate such uncertainty to improve label quality.

Method: The study examines the impact of expert uncertainty on label noise and introduces a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark and a label smoothing method.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by better handling expert-driven uncertainty.

Conclusion: Incorporating expert uncertainty into medical image analysis improves label quality and model performance, addressing a critical gap in existing methods.

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural methods' performance in combinatorial optimization by learning from structured problem instance distributions, rather than relying on generic data.

Method: Generates large base problem instances and samples training/test instances from them, evaluating NCO methods and meta-heuristics on unseen problems.

Result: NCO methods show improved performance when trained on sub-samples from a fixed base distribution, reducing the gap with meta-heuristics.

Conclusion: Structured sampling from a base distribution enhances neural solvers' effectiveness in routing problems, though meta-heuristics still outperform.

Abstract: Neural Combinatorial Optimization aims to learn to solve a class of
combinatorial problems through data-driven methods and notably through
employing neural networks by learning the underlying distribution of problem
instances. While, so far neural methods struggle to outperform highly
engineered problem specific meta-heuristics, this work explores a novel
approach to formulate the distribution of problem instances to learn from and,
more importantly, plant a structure in the sampled problem instances. In
application to routing problems, we generate large problem instances that
represent custom base problem instance distributions from which training
instances are sampled. The test instances to evaluate the methods on the
routing task consist of unseen problems sampled from the underlying large
problem instance. We evaluate representative NCO methods and specialized
Operation Research meta heuristics on this novel task and demonstrate that the
performance gap between neural routing solvers and highly specialized
meta-heuristics decreases when learning from sub-samples drawn from a fixed
base node distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analog front-end design relies on expert intuition and iterative simulations, lacking fully automated optimization for performance-critical applications.

Method: AnalogCoder-Pro uses rejection sampling for LLM fine-tuning, multimodal diagnosis, and repair workflows, automating netlist interpretation and parameter extraction.

Result: The framework improves analog circuit design success rates and enhances performance through joint topology generation and sizing optimization.

Conclusion: AnalogCoder-Pro establishes an end-to-end workflow for automated analog design, bridging gaps in current automation methods.

Abstract: Despite advances in analog design automation, analog front-end design still
heavily depends on expert intuition and iterative simulations, underscoring
critical gaps in fully automated optimization for performance-critical
applications. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs)
has brought new promise to analog design automation. However, existing work
remains in its early stages, and holistic joint optimization for practical
end-to-end solutions remains largely unexplored. We propose AnalogCoder-Pro, a
unified multimodal LLM-based framework that integrates generative capabilities
and optimization techniques to jointly explore circuit topologies and optimize
device sizing, automatically generating performance-specific, fully sized
schematic netlists. AnalogCoder-Pro employs rejection sampling for fine-tuning
LLMs on high-quality synthesized circuit data and introduces a multimodal
diagnosis and repair workflow based on functional specifications and waveform
images. By leveraging LLMs to interpret generated circuit netlists,
AnalogCoder-Pro automates the extraction of critical design parameters and the
formulation of parameter spaces, establishing an end-to-end workflow for
simultaneous topology generation and device sizing optimization. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these orthogonal approaches significantly improve
the success rate of analog circuit design and enhance circuit performance.

TL;DR: SplitMe, a split federated learning (SFL) framework, reduces communication costs in O-RAN by eliminating frequent data transfers and optimizes resource allocation to meet deadlines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing model size in federated learning (FL) for O-RAN leads to longer training times, risking deadline violations for non- and near-RT RICs.

Method: SplitMe uses mutual learning to train near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC models alternately, avoiding frequent transfers, and solves a joint optimization problem for resource allocation.

Result: SplitMe outperforms SFL, FedAvg, and O-RANFed in cost and convergence.

Conclusion: SplitMe effectively addresses communication and resource challenges in O-RAN FL, improving efficiency and meeting deadlines.

Abstract: The hierarchical architecture of Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has
enabled a new Federated Learning (FL) paradigm that trains models using data
from non- and near-real-time (near-RT) Radio Intelligent Controllers (RICs).
However, the ever-increasing model size leads to longer training time,
jeopardizing the deadline requirements for both non-RT and near-RT RICs. To
address this issue, split federated learning (SFL) offers an approach by
offloading partial model layers from near-RT-RIC to high-performance
non-RT-RIC. Nonetheless, its deployment presents two challenges: (i) Frequent
data/gradient transfers between near-RT-RIC and non-RT-RIC in SFL incur
significant communication cost in O-RAN. (ii) Proper allocation of
computational and communication resources in O-RAN is vital to satisfying the
deadline and affects SFL convergence. Therefore, we propose SplitMe, an SFL
framework that exploits mutual learning to alternately and independently train
the near-RT-RIC's model and the non-RT-RIC's inverse model, eliminating
frequent transfers. The ''inverse'' of the inverse model is derived via a
zeroth-order technique to integrate the final model. Then, we solve a joint
optimization problem for SplitMe to minimize overall resource costs with
deadline-aware selection of near-RT-RICs and adaptive local updates. Our
numerical results demonstrate that SplitMe remarkably outperforms FL frameworks
like SFL, FedAvg and O-RANFed regarding costs and convergence.

*Xi Chen,Jianchuan Yang,Junjie Zhang,Runnan Yang,Xu Liu,Hong Wang,Ziyu Ren,Wenqi Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JacobiNet improves PINNs by learning coordinate transformations, addressing normalization, boundary enforcement, and loss imbalance, achieving significant accuracy and speed improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with irregular boundaries due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement, and imbalanced loss terms. Traditional mapping methods are limited by case-specific meshes and simple geometries.

Method: JacobiNet uses neural networks to learn continuous, differentiable coordinate mappings from supervised point pairs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without meshing.

Result: JacobiNet reduces relative L2 error (0.013-0.039 vs. 0.287-0.637), improves accuracy by 18.3x, and achieves 10x speedup in vessel-like domains.

Conclusion: JacobiNet effectively addresses PINN challenges, offering generalization, accuracy, and efficiency for PDE solving on irregular domains.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are effective for solving PDEs by
incorporating physical laws into the learning process. However, they face
challenges with irregular boundaries, leading to instability and slow
convergence due to inconsistent normalization, inaccurate boundary enforcement,
and imbalanced loss terms. A common solution is to map the domain to a regular
space, but traditional methods rely on case-specific meshes and simple
geometries, limiting their compatibility with modern frameworks. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce JacobiNet, a neural network-based coordinate
transformation method that learns continuous, differentiable mappings from
supervised point pairs. Utilizing lightweight MLPs, JacobiNet allows for direct
Jacobian computation via autograd and integrates seamlessly with downstream
PINNs, enabling end-to-end differentiable PDE solving without the need for
meshing or explicit Jacobian computation. JacobiNet effectively addresses
normalization challenges, facilitates hard constraints of boundary conditions,
and mitigates the long-standing imbalance among loss terms. It demonstrates
significant improvements, reducing the relative L2 error from 0.287-0.637 to
0.013-0.039, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.3*. In vessel-like
domains, it enables rapid mapping for unseen geometries, improving prediction
accuracy by 3.65* and achieving over 10* speedup, showcasing its
generalization, accuracy, and efficiency.

*Nys Tjade Siegel,James H. Cole,Mohamad Habes,Stefan Haufe,Kerstin Ritter,Marc-André Schulz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A large-scale validation of XAI methods in neuroimaging reveals failures in GradCAM and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, while SmoothGrad performs robustly, emphasizing the need for domain-specific XAI adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of rigorous validation for XAI methods in neuroimaging, risking misinterpretation of deep learning models.

Method: A novel XAI validation framework was used to systematically compare methods on ~45,000 structural brain MRIs, with verifiable ground truth tasks.

Result: GradCAM failed to localize features, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation produced artifactual explanations, while SmoothGrad was consistently accurate.

Conclusion: Domain-specific adaptation of XAI methods is critical, and prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI may need re-evaluation.

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

*Javier Fumanal-Idocin,Raquel Fernandez-Peralta,Javier Andreu-Perez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a rule-based dynamic feature selection (DFS) method for interpretable and efficient sample-specific feature selection, outperforming opaque models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional feature selection methods lack transparency and adaptability per sample, limiting their use in critical applications like clinical decisions.

Method: A rule-based system is used as a base classifier for DFS, enhancing interpretability and reducing computational load by constraining the feature search space.

Result: The method provides interpretable decisions, quantitative uncertainty measures, and competitive performance against opaque state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The rule-based DFS approach offers a transparent, efficient, and effective alternative to traditional opaque feature selection methods.

Abstract: Dynamic feature selection (DFS) offers a compelling alternative to
traditional, static feature selection by adapting the selected features to each
individual sample. Unlike classical methods that apply a uniform feature set,
DFS customizes feature selection per sample, providing insight into the
decision-making process for each case. DFS is especially significant in
settings where decision transparency is key, i.e., clinical decisions; however,
existing methods use opaque models, which hinder their applicability in
real-life scenarios. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging a
rule-based system as a base classifier for the DFS process, which enhances
decision interpretability compared to neural estimators. We also show how this
method provides a quantitative measure of uncertainty for each feature query
and can make the feature selection process computationally lighter by
constraining the feature search space. We also discuss when greedy selection of
conditional mutual information is equivalent to selecting features that
minimize the difference with respect to the global model predictions. Finally,
we demonstrate the competitive performance of our rule-based DFS approach
against established and state-of-the-art greedy and RL methods, which are
mostly considered opaque, compared to our explainable rule-based system.

*Xudong Wang,Tongxin Li,Chris Ding,Jicong Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARGNN introduces a framework for adaptive Riemannian geometry in GNNs, enabling nodes to learn optimal local geometries for diverse graph structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geometric GNNs struggle with graphs' complex geometric heterogeneity, as they use fixed-curvature manifolds.

Method: ARGNN learns a continuous, anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field, parameterized efficiently for tractability, with Ricci flow-inspired regularization.

Result: Superior performance on homophilic and heterophilic datasets, with interpretable learned geometries.

Conclusion: ARGNN unifies prior GNNs, adapts to diverse structures, and provides theoretical and empirical validation.

Abstract: Graph data often exhibits complex geometric heterogeneity, where structures
with varying local curvature, such as tree-like hierarchies and dense
communities, coexist within a single network. Existing geometric GNNs, which
embed graphs into single fixed-curvature manifolds or discrete product spaces,
struggle to capture this diversity. We introduce Adaptive Riemannian Graph
Neural Networks (ARGNN), a novel framework that learns a continuous and
anisotropic Riemannian metric tensor field over the graph. It allows each node
to determine its optimal local geometry, enabling the model to fluidly adapt to
the graph's structural landscape. Our core innovation is an efficient
parameterization of the node-wise metric tensor, specializing to a learnable
diagonal form that captures directional geometric information while maintaining
computational tractability. To ensure geometric regularity and stable training,
we integrate a Ricci flow-inspired regularization that smooths the learned
manifold. Theoretically, we establish the rigorous geometric evolution
convergence guarantee for ARGNN and provide a continuous generalization that
unifies prior fixed or mixed-curvature GNNs. Empirically, our method
demonstrates superior performance on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmark
datasets with the ability to capture diverse structures adaptively. Moreover,
the learned geometries both offer interpretable insights into the underlying
graph structure and empirically corroborate our theoretical analysis.

*Siyi Liu,Yujia Zheng,Yongqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: StructSynth integrates LLMs with structural control to generate high-fidelity synthetic tabular data in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in specialized domains limits machine learning applications. Traditional generative models and LLMs fail to preserve tabular data structure.

Method: StructSynth uses a two-stage approach: structure discovery (learning a DAG) and LLM-guided generation adhering to the DAG.

Result: StructSynth outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural integrity and utility, especially in low-data scenarios.

Conclusion: StructSynth effectively balances privacy and fidelity, offering a robust solution for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: The application of machine learning on tabular data in specialized domains is
severely limited by data scarcity. While generative models offer a solution,
traditional methods falter in low-data regimes, and recent Large Language
Models (LLMs) often ignore the explicit dependency structure of tabular data,
leading to low-fidelity synthetics. To address these limitations, we introduce
StructSynth, a novel framework that integrates the generative power of LLMs
with robust structural control. StructSynth employs a two-stage architecture.
First, it performs explicit structure discovery to learn a Directed Acyclic
Graph (DAG) from the available data. Second, this learned structure serves as a
high-fidelity blueprint to steer the LLM's generation process, forcing it to
adhere to the learned feature dependencies and thereby ensuring the generated
data respects the underlying structure by design. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that StructSynth produces synthetic data with significantly higher
structural integrity and downstream utility than state-of-the-art methods. It
proves especially effective in challenging low-data scenarios, successfully
navigating the trade-off between privacy preservation and statistical fidelity.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TransRA, a novel KGE model, to integrate graph embeddings into Ads ranking models, addressing challenges with offsite conversion data and achieving significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better leverage offsite conversion data and explore connections between onsite and offsite user activities for improved Ads ranking models.

Method: Constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph from user activities, introduced TransRA, and employed Large ID Embedding Table and attention-based KGE finetuning.

Result: Significant AUC lift in CTR and CVR predictions, with deployed framework contributing to 2.69% CTR lift and 1.34% CPC reduction.

Conclusion: The techniques can benefit other large-scale industrial models, demonstrating practical impact.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have been extensively applied to industry
recommendation systems, as seen in models like GraphSage\cite{GraphSage},
TwHIM\cite{TwHIM}, LiGNN\cite{LiGNN} etc. In these works, graphs were
constructed based on users' activities on the platforms, and various graph
models were developed to effectively learn node embeddings. In addition to
users' onsite activities, their offsite conversions are crucial for Ads models
to capture their shopping interest. To better leverage offsite conversion data
and explore the connection between onsite and offsite activities, we
constructed a large-scale heterogeneous graph based on users' onsite ad
interactions and opt-in offsite conversion activities. Furthermore, we
introduced TransRA (TransR\cite{TransR} with Anchors), a novel Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, to more efficiently integrate graph embeddings into Ads
ranking models. However, our Ads ranking models initially struggled to directly
incorporate Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), and only modest gains were
observed during offline experiments. To address this challenge, we employed the
Large ID Embedding Table technique and innovated an attention based KGE
finetuning approach within the Ads ranking models. As a result, we observed a
significant AUC lift in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR)
prediction models. Moreover, this framework has been deployed in Pinterest's
Ads Engagement Model and contributed to $2.69\%$ CTR lift and $1.34\%$ CPC
reduction. We believe the techniques presented in this paper can be leveraged
by other large-scale industrial models.

TL;DR: DeepKoopFormer combines Transformers and Koopman theory for stable, interpretable time series forecasting, outperforming LSTMs and Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing interpretability and instability issues in Transformer-based models for high-dimensional, nonlinear time series forecasting.

Method: Uses a modular encoder-propagator-decoder structure with a spectrally constrained linear Koopman operator in latent space, ensuring stability via structural guarantees.

Result: Outperforms LSTM and Transformer baselines in accuracy, noise robustness, and long-term stability across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: DeepKoopFormer is a flexible, interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in dynamic and high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role across scientific, industrial, and
environmental domains, especially when dealing with high-dimensional and
nonlinear systems. While Transformer-based models have recently achieved
state-of-the-art performance in long-range forecasting, they often suffer from
interpretability issues and instability in the presence of noise or dynamical
uncertainty. In this work, we propose DeepKoopFormer, a principled forecasting
framework that combines the representational power of Transformers with the
theoretical rigor of Koopman operator theory. Our model features a modular
encoder-propagator-decoder structure, where temporal dynamics are learned via a
spectrally constrained, linear Koopman operator in a latent space. We impose
structural guarantees-such as bounded spectral radius, Lyapunov based energy
regularization, and orthogonal parameterization to ensure stability and
interpretability. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on both synthetic
dynamical systems, real-world climate dataset (wind speed and surface
pressure), financial time series (cryptocurrency), and electricity generation
dataset using the Python package that is prepared for this purpose. Across all
experiments, DeepKoopFormer consistently outperforms standard LSTM and baseline
Transformer models in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, and long-term
forecasting stability. These results establish DeepKoopFormer as a flexible,
interpretable, and robust framework for forecasting in high dimensional and
dynamical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical datasets often suffer from issues like missing values and class imbalance, hindering ML model performance. AutoML-Med aims to automate and optimize preprocessing and modeling to improve results.

Method: AutoML-Med uses Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for preprocessing exploration, trains models with selected metrics, and employs Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for optimization.

Result: AutoML-Med achieves higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity in clinical settings, proving effective for sparse and imbalanced medical data.

Conclusion: AutoML-Med shows promise for enhancing ML applications in healthcare by automating and optimizing preprocessing and modeling for medical datasets.

Abstract: Medical datasets are typically affected by issues such as missing values,
class imbalance, a heterogeneous feature types, and a high number of features
versus a relatively small number of samples, preventing machine learning models
from obtaining proper results in classification and regression tasks. This
paper introduces AutoML-Med, an Automated Machine Learning tool specifically
designed to address these challenges, minimizing user intervention and
identifying the optimal combination of preprocessing techniques and predictive
models. AutoML-Med's architecture incorporates Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS)
for exploring preprocessing methods, trains models using selected metrics, and
utilizes Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) for fine-tuned
optimization of the most influential preprocessing steps. Experimental results
demonstrate AutoML-Med's effectiveness in two different clinical settings,
achieving higher balanced accuracy and sensitivity, which are crucial for
identifying at-risk patients, compared to other state-of-the-art tools.
AutoML-Med's ability to improve prediction results, especially in medical
datasets with sparse data and class imbalance, highlights its potential to
streamline Machine Learning applications in healthcare.

TL;DR: A 3x3 convolutional kernel trained on 200 audio samples produces emergent effects using Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK) and AuGAN, achieving unique transformations through adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore minimal-data adversarial training for discovering novel audio transformations and effects.

Method: Uses CAK for identity-preserving control and AuGAN to verify control application instead of forgery detection.

Result: The kernel exhibits diagonal structure, enabling frequency-dependent temporal shifts and musical effects.

Conclusion: Adversarial training can uncover audio transformations from small datasets, offering new effect design possibilities.

Abstract: We demonstrate that a single 3x3 convolutional kernel can produce emergent
audio effects when trained on 200 samples from a personalized corpus. We
achieve this through two key techniques: (1) Conditioning Aware Kernels (CAK),
where output = input + (learned_pattern x control), with a soft-gate mechanism
supporting identity preservation at zero control; and (2) AuGAN (Audit GAN),
which reframes adversarial training from "is this real?" to "did you apply the
requested value?" Rather than learning to generate or detect forgeries, our
networks cooperate to verify control application, discovering unique
transformations. The learned kernel exhibits a diagonal structure creating
frequency-dependent temporal shifts that are capable of producing musical
effects based on input characteristics. Our results show the potential of
adversarial training to discover audio transformations from minimal data,
enabling new approaches to effect design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOST integrates low-rank and sparse structures for efficient LLM pre-training, achieving competitive performance with reduced costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the prohibitive computational and memory costs of full-rank LLM pre-training by combining low-rank and sparse techniques effectively.

Method: Uses singular value decomposition for low-rank components and constructs channel-wise sparse components to complement expressiveness.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior performance to full-rank models while reducing memory and compute overhead.

Conclusion: LOST offers an efficient and effective alternative to full-rank LLM pre-training.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across a wide range of tasks, their massive scale incurs prohibitive
computational and memory costs for pre-training from scratch. Recent studies
have investigated the use of low-rank parameterization as a means of reducing
model size and training cost. In this context, sparsity is often employed as a
complementary technique to recover important information lost in low-rank
compression by capturing salient features in the residual space. However,
existing approaches typically combine low-rank and sparse components in a
simplistic or ad hoc manner, often resulting in undesirable performance
degradation compared to full-rank training. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{LO}w-rank and \textbf{S}parse pre-\textbf{T}raining (\textbf{LOST}) for
LLMs, a novel method that ingeniously integrates low-rank and sparse structures
to enable effective training of LLMs from scratch under strict efficiency
constraints. LOST applies singular value decomposition to weight matrices,
preserving the dominant low-rank components, while allocating the remaining
singular values to construct channel-wise sparse components to complement the
expressiveness of low-rank training. We evaluate LOST on LLM pretraining
ranging from 60M to 7B parameters. Our experiments show that LOST achieves
competitive or superior performance compared to full-rank models, while
significantly reducing both memory and compute overhead. Moreover, Code is

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: The paper explores gossip protocols as a flexible, decentralized coordination method for agentic AI, complementing structured communication to enable emergent, swarm-like intelligence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current structured communication protocols lack the ability to support emergent, adaptive collective cognition in distributed agents.

Method: Revisits gossip protocols from distributed systems, analyzing their potential for scalable, context-rich communication in agentic AI.

Result: Identifies gaps in current architectures and outlines open challenges like semantic filtering, trustworthiness, and consistency.

Conclusion: Gossip protocols offer a promising but underutilized approach for resilient, self-organizing multi-agent systems, warranting further research.

Abstract: As agentic platforms scale, agents are evolving beyond static roles and fixed
toolchains, creating a growing need for flexible, decentralized coordination.
Today's structured communication protocols (e.g., direct agent-to-agent
messaging) excel at reliability and task delegation, but they fall short in
enabling emergent, swarm-like intelligence, where distributed agents
continuously learn, adapt, and communicate to form collective cognition. This
paper revisits gossip protocols, long valued in distributed systems for their
fault tolerance and decentralization, and argues that they offer a missing
layer for context-rich, adaptive communication in agentic AI. Gossip enables
scalable, low-overhead dissemination of shared knowledge, but also raises
unresolved challenges around semantic filtering, staleness, trustworthiness,
and consistency in high-stakes environments. Rather than proposing a new
framework, this work charts a research agenda for integrating gossip as a
complementary substrate alongside structured protocols. We identify critical
gaps in current agent-to-agent architectures, highlight where gossip could
reshape assumptions about coordination, and outline open questions around
intent propagation, knowledge decay, and peer-to-peer trust. Gossip is not a
silver bullet, but overlooking it risks missing a key path toward resilient,
reflexive, and self-organizing multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses fairness in leader selection in Stackelberg games using mediators in multi-agent reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the unfairness in leader selection in Stackelberg games, especially when agents are self-interested.

Method: Proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework integrating mediators for leader selection.

Result: Mediators lead to fairer actions by self-interested agents, improving overall fairness in returns.

Conclusion: Mediators in Stackelberg games enhance fairness in leader selection and agent returns.

Abstract: Stackelberg games and their resulting equilibria have received increasing
attention in the multi-agent reinforcement learning literature. Each stage of a
traditional Stackelberg game involves a leader(s) acting first, followed by the
followers. In situations where the roles of leader(s) and followers can be
interchanged, the designated role can have considerable advantages, for
example, in first-mover advantage settings. Then the question arises: Who
should be the leader and when? A bias in the leader selection process can lead
to unfair outcomes. This problem is aggravated if the agents are
self-interested and care only about their goals and rewards. We formally define
this leader selection problem and show its relation to fairness in agents'
returns. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
that maximizes fairness by integrating mediators. Mediators have previously
been used in the simultaneous action setting with varying levels of control,
such as directly performing agents' actions or just recommending them. Our
framework integrates mediators in the Stackelberg setting with minimal control
(leader selection). We show that the presence of mediators leads to
self-interested agents taking fair actions, resulting in higher overall
fairness in agents' returns.

TL;DR: LIFE is a lightweight, modular framework for forecasting LLM inference performance on heterogeneous hardware without extensive benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for predicting LLM inference performance are hardware-specific and lack generalizability, making efficient deployment challenging.

Method: LIFE uses modular analytical models of operators to characterize LLM workloads in a hardware-agnostic way, incorporating optimizations like quantization and operator fusion.

Result: Validated on CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs, and GPUs with Llama2-7B, LIFE accurately forecasts performance metrics like TTFT and TPOT using only hardware specs.

Conclusion: LIFE enables efficient LLM deployment across diverse hardware by providing a generalizable performance forecasting tool.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly deployed as local agents
on personal devices with CPUs, NPUs and integrated GPUs. However, forecasting
inference performance on devices with such heterogeneity remains challenging
due to the dynamic compute and memory demands. Existing approaches rely on GPU
benchmarking or machine learning-based latency predictors, which are often
hardware-specific and lack generalizability. To this end, we introduce LIFE, a
lightweight and modular analytical framework that is comprised of modular
analytical model of operators, configurable to characterize LLM inference
workloads in a hardware and dataset-agnostic manner. LIFE characterizes the
influence of software and model optimizations, such as quantization, KV cache
compression, LoRA adapters, chunked prefill, different attentions, and operator
fusion, on performance metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT),
time-per-output-token (TPOT) and tokens-per-second (TPS). LIFE enables
performance forecasting using only hardware specifications, such as TOPS and
memory bandwidth, without requiring extensive dataset benchmarking. We validate
LIFE's forecasting with inference on AMD Ryzen CPUs, NPUs, iGPUs and NVIDIA
V100 GPUs, with Llama2-7B variants, demonstrating the utility of LIFE in
forecasting LLM performance through lens of system efficiency to enable
efficient LLM deployment across different hardware platforms.

TL;DR: A general method for visualizing uncertainty in statistical graphics by treating the graphic as a function of the underlying distribution, propagating uncertainty through repeated sampling and aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplifying uncertainty visualization by eliminating the need for specialized methods for different graphics.

Method: Repeatedly samples from the data distribution, generates graphics for each sample, and aggregates them pixel-by-pixel into a static image.

Result: Produces versatile uncertainty visualizations, including conventional and non-standard cases, with theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: Makes uncertainty visualization more accessible and useful for practitioners and teaching.

Abstract: Visualizing uncertainty is integral to data analysis, yet its application is
often hindered by the need for specialized methods for quantifying and
representing uncertainty for different types of graphics. We introduce a
general approach that simplifies this process. The core idea is to treat the
statistical graphic as a function of the underlying distribution. Instead of
first calculating uncertainty metrics and then plotting them, the method
propagates uncertainty through to the visualization. By repeatedly sampling
from the data distribution and generating a complete statistical graphic for
each sample, a distribution over graphics is produced. These graphics are
aggregated pixel-by-pixel to create a single, static image. This approach is
versatile, requires no specific knowledge from the user beyond how to create
the basic statistical graphic, and comes with theoretical coverage guarantees
for standard cases such as confidence intervals and bands. We provide a
reference implementation as a Python library to demonstrate the method's
utility. Our approach not only reproduces conventional uncertainty
visualizations for point estimates and regression lines but also seamlessly
extends to non-standard cases, including pie charts, stacked bar charts, and
tables. This approach makes uncertainty visualization more accessible to
practitioners and can be a valuable tool for teaching uncertainty.

Method: Patient records were serialized into text, embeddings were generated using LLMs (LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Stella-En-400M-V5), and K-means clustering was applied. Classical methods included K-Medoids on UMAP and FAMD-reduced data.

Result: Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B with clustering objective identified distinct subgroups. LLM methods outperformed classical techniques.

Conclusion: LLM-based clustering shows promise for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in
resource-limited settings.

### [614] [Inferring processes within dynamic forest models using hybrid modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01228)
*Maximilian Pichler,Yannek Käber*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: FINN combines forest gap models with deep neural networks (DNNs) to improve forest dynamics predictions, outperforming fully mechanistic models and learning ecologically plausible growth forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Dynamic Vegetation Models (DVMs) struggle with misspecified assumptions and inflexible functional forms, limiting their predictive accuracy under novel climatic conditions.

Method: FINN integrates DNNs into a forest gap model, replacing traditional processes. The DNNs are calibrated alongside mechanistic components in a unified step.

Result: In a case study, FINN improved predictive performance and succession trajectories, with the DNN learning an ecologically plausible growth form.

Conclusion: FINN offers a versatile hybrid approach to infer forest dynamics and enhance ecosystem trajectory forecasts under unprecedented environmental change.

Abstract: Modeling forest dynamics under novel climatic conditions requires a careful
balance between process-based understanding and empirical flexibility. Dynamic
Vegetation Models (DVM) represent ecological processes mechanistically, but
their performance is prone to misspecified assumptions about functional forms.
Inferring the structure of these processes and their functional forms correctly
from data remains a major challenge because current approaches, such as plug-in
estimators, have proven ineffective. We introduce Forest Informed Neural
Networks (FINN), a hybrid modeling approach that combines a forest gap model
with deep neural networks (DNN). FINN replaces processes with DNNs, which are
then calibrated alongside the other mechanistic components in one unified step.
In a case study on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha plot we demonstrate that
replacing the growth process with a DNN improves predictive performance and
succession trajectories compared to a fully mechanistic version of FINN.
Furthermore, we discovered that the DNN learned an ecologically plausible,
improved functional form of growth, which we extracted from the DNN using
explainable AI. In conclusion, our new hybrid modeling approach offers a
versatile opportunity to infer forest dynamics from data and to improve
forecasts of ecosystem trajectories under unprecedented environmental change.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ChEmbed, a domain-adapted text embedding model for chemistry, improves retrieval quality by fine-tuning on chemical literature and adding specialized tokens, outperforming general models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose text embedding models struggle with complex chemical terminologies, leading to poor retrieval quality in chemistry literature.

Method: Developed ChEmbed by fine-tuning on chemistry-specific text from PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv, generating synthetic queries for training, and adding 900 specialized tokens.

Result: ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art models, increasing nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp) on the ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark.

Conclusion: ChEmbed is a lightweight, reproducible solution that significantly enhances chemical literature retrieval.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on
accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However,
general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent
complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality.
Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not
yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this
challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding
models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the
PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training
data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries,
resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs.
Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized
tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the
fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains
a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer
passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically
have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens. Evaluated on our newly introduced
ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark, ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art general
embedding models, raising nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp). ChEmbed represents
a practical, lightweight, and reproducible embedding solution that effectively
improves retrieval for chemical literature search.

### [616] [Towards Bridging Review Sparsity in Recommendation with Textual Edge Graph Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01128)
*Leyao Wang,Xutao Mao,Xuhui Zhan,Yuying Zhao,Bo Ni,Ryan A. Rossi,Nesreen K. Ahmed,Tyler Derr*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: TWISTER is a framework for imputing missing reviews in recommender systems by jointly modeling semantic and structural signals, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the sparsity of user reviews in recommender systems, which limits effectiveness, by generating coherent and personalized missing reviews.

Method: Represents user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), uses line-graph views for relational context, and employs a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator.

Result: Outperforms numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines, generating higher-quality reviews and improving recommendation performance.

Conclusion: TWISTER produces more helpful, authentic, and specific reviews while enhancing structural signals for better recommendations.

Abstract: Textual reviews enrich recommender systems with fine-grained preference
signals and enhanced explainability. However, in real-world scenarios, users
rarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the
effectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate
missing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques
-- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose
contextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook
structural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these
shortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual
Edge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by
jointly modeling semantic and structural signals. Specifically, we represent
user-item interactions as a Textual-Edge Graph (TEG), treating reviews as edge
attributes. To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and
employ a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction
lacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's
natural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized
review. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER
consistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines,
delivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced
recommendation performance. In summary, TWISTER generates reviews that are more
helpful, authentic, and specific, while smoothing structural signals for
improved recommendations.

*Omar Elgohary,Nathan Jorgenson,Trenton Marple*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The study adapts ALMM for news recommendation on the MIND dataset, improving cold-start performance by restructuring it for sequential news clicks and using BERT/TF-IDF for feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance recommendation performance in cold-start scenarios by modifying ALMM for sequential news click behavior.

Method: Restructured ALMM for news recommendation, replacing audio features with BERT/TF-IDF for text, and introduced a pre-processing pipeline.

Result: Improved accuracy and robustness over baseline models in cold-start scenarios, but unmodified ALMM was unsuitable for news recommendation.

Conclusion: ALMM can be adapted for news recommendation with modifications, but its original form is ineffective for this task.

Abstract: This replication study modifies ALMM, the Adaptive Linear Mapping Model
constructed for the next song recommendation, to the news recommendation
problem on the MIND dataset. The original version of ALMM computes latent
representations for users, last-time items, and current items in a tensor
factorization structure and learns a linear mapping from content features to
latent item vectors. Our replication aims to improve recommendation performance
in cold-start scenarios by restructuring this model to sequential news click
behavior, viewing consecutively read articles as (last news, next news) tuples.
Instead of the original audio features, we apply BERT and a TF-IDF (Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to news titles and abstracts to extract
token contextualized representations and align them with triplet-based user
reading patterns. We also propose a reproducibly thorough pre-processing
pipeline combining news filtering and feature integrity validation. Our
implementation of ALMM with TF-IDF shows relatively improved recommendation
accuracy and robustness over Forbes and Oord baseline models in the cold-start
scenario. We demonstrate that ALMM in a minimally modified state is not
suitable for next news recommendation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A hybrid recommender system combining Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) improves personalization and interpretability by enriching user/item representations and generating natural-language justifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing personalization and interpretability in recommender systems, especially with limited user feedback or heterogeneous item attributes.

Method: Uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for users/items, processes them with GATs, and employs a hybrid loss function (BPR, cosine similarity, negative sampling). LLM reranks and justifies recommendations.

Result: Outperforms baselines on MovieLens datasets; LLM embeddings and cosine similarity are key to performance gains.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs with GATs enhances accuracy and interpretability in recommender systems.

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for guiding users through the vast and
diverse landscape of digital content by delivering personalized and relevant
suggestions. However, improving both personalization and interpretability
remains a challenge, particularly in scenarios involving limited user feedback
or heterogeneous item attributes. In this article, we propose a novel hybrid
recommendation framework that combines Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with
Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these limitations. LLMs are first used
to enrich user and item representations by generating semantically meaningful
profiles based on metadata such as titles, genres, and overviews. These
enriched embeddings serve as initial node features in a user and movie
bipartite graph, which is processed using a GAT based collaborative filtering
model. To enhance ranking accuracy, we introduce a hybrid loss function that
combines Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), cosine similarity, and robust
negative sampling. Post-processing involves reranking the GAT-generated
recommendations using the LLM, which also generates natural-language
justifications to improve transparency. We evaluated our model on benchmark
datasets, including MovieLens 100k and 1M, where it consistently outperforms
strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that LLM-based embeddings and the
cosine similarity term significantly contribute to performance gains. This work
demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs to improve both the accuracy and
interpretability of recommender systems.

TL;DR: CFRR is a causal framework for reciprocal recommender systems that reduces bias from over-represented popular profiles, improving accuracy and fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Logged data in reciprocal recommender systems skews learning and fairness by over-representing popular profiles due to past exposure policies.

Method: CFRR uses inverse propensity scored, self-normalized objectives to mitigate bias.

Result: CFRR improves NDCG@10 by up to 3.5%, increases long-tail user coverage by up to 51%, and reduces Gini exposure inequality by up to 24%.

Conclusion: CFRR provides a promising solution for more accurate and fair user-to-user matching.

Abstract: Reciprocal recommender systems (RRS) in dating, gaming, and talent platforms
require mutual acceptance for a match. Logged data, however, over-represents
popular profiles due to past exposure policies, creating feedback loops that
skew learning and fairness. We introduce Counterfactual Reciprocal Recommender
Systems (CFRR), a causal framework to mitigate this bias. CFRR uses inverse
propensity scored, self-normalized objectives. Experiments show CFRR improves
NDCG@10 by up to 3.5% (e.g., from 0.459 to 0.475 on DBLP, from 0.299 to 0.307
on Synthetic), increases long-tail user coverage by up to 51% (from 0.504 to
0.763 on Synthetic), and reduces Gini exposure inequality by up to 24% (from
0.708 to 0.535 on Synthetic). CFRR offers a promising approach for more
accurate and fair user-to-user matching.

*Raj Mahmud,Yufeng Wu,Abdullah Bin Sawad,Shlomo Berkovsky,Mukesh Prasad,A. Baki Kocaballi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A systematic review of 23 empirical studies on Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) highlights gaps in UX evaluation, especially for adaptive and LLM-based systems, and proposes future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited and overlooked empirical UX studies in CRSs, particularly adaptive and LLM-based systems.

Method: Conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, analyzing 23 empirical studies (2017-2025) on UX conceptualization, measurement, and impact of domain, adaptivity, and LLMs.

Result: Identified gaps: over-reliance on post hoc surveys, lack of turn-level affective UX assessment, and insufficient linkage of adaptive behaviors to UX. LLM-based CRSs face challenges like opacity and verbosity, often unaddressed in evaluations.

Conclusion: Proposes a structured synthesis of UX metrics, comparative analysis of adaptive systems, and an agenda for LLM-aware UX evaluation to improve transparency and user-centered practices.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) are receiving growing research
attention across domains, yet their user experience (UX) evaluation remains
limited. Existing reviews largely overlook empirical UX studies, particularly
in adaptive and large language model (LLM)-based CRSs. To address this gap, we
conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, synthesising 23
empirical studies published between 2017 and 2025. We analysed how UX has been
conceptualised, measured, and shaped by domain, adaptivity, and LLM.
  Our findings reveal persistent limitations: post hoc surveys dominate,
turn-level affective UX constructs are rarely assessed, and adaptive behaviours
are seldom linked to UX outcomes. LLM-based CRSs introduce further challenges,
including epistemic opacity and verbosity, yet evaluations infrequently address
these issues. We contribute a structured synthesis of UX metrics, a comparative
analysis of adaptive and nonadaptive systems, and a forward-looking agenda for
LLM-aware UX evaluation. These findings support the development of more
transparent, engaging, and user-centred CRS evaluation practices.

### [621] [FinCPRG: A Bidirectional Generation Pipeline for Hierarchical Queries and Rich Relevance in Financial Chinese Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02222)
*Xuan Xu,Beilin Chu,Qinhong Lin,Yixiao Zhong,Fufang Wen,Jiaqi Liu,Binjie Fei,Yu Li,Zhongliang Yang,Linna Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a bidirectional generation pipeline for creating hierarchical queries and mining relevance labels in passage retrieval datasets, addressing limitations in cross-doc query needs and annotation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for constructing passage retrieval datasets struggle with cross-doc query expression and annotation quality control.

Method: Proposes a bidirectional pipeline with bottom-up (single-doc) and top-down (multi-doc) query generation methods, plus indirect positives mining for relevance labels.

Result: Constructed FinCPRG, a dataset with hierarchical queries and rich relevance labels from 1.3k financial reports, validated for quality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: The pipeline and FinCPRG dataset effectively address limitations and enhance passage retrieval for training and benchmarking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential in constructing passage retrieval datasets. However, existing methods
still face limitations in expressing cross-doc query needs and controlling
annotation quality. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
bidirectional generation pipeline, which aims to generate 3-level hierarchical
queries for both intra-doc and cross-doc scenarios and mine additional
relevance labels on top of direct mapping annotation. The pipeline introduces
two query generation methods: bottom-up from single-doc text and top-down from
multi-doc titles. The bottom-up method uses LLMs to disassemble and generate
structured queries at both sentence-level and passage-level simultaneously from
intra-doc passages. The top-down approach incorporates three key financial
elements--industry, topic, and time--to divide report titles into clusters and
prompts LLMs to generate topic-level queries from each cluster. For relevance
annotation, our pipeline not only relies on direct mapping annotation from the
generation relationship but also implements an indirect positives mining method
to enrich the relevant query-passage pairs. Using this pipeline, we constructed
a Financial Passage Retrieval Generated dataset (FinCPRG) from almost 1.3k
Chinese financial research reports, which includes hierarchical queries and
rich relevance labels. Through evaluations of mined relevance labels,
benchmarking and training experiments, we assessed the quality of FinCPRG and
validated its effectiveness as a passage retrieval dataset for both training
and benchmarking.

TL;DR: The paper proposes STIM, a method for local-life service recommendation, addressing challenges like long sequence sparsity and spatio-temporal dependence by modeling user behavior with a forgetting curve analogy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle challenges in modeling user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, such as sparsity and spatio-temporal dependence, by drawing parallels to human memory processes.

Method: Introduces STIM, which includes a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve, a query-based MoE approach, and a hierarchical multi-interest network unit to model time, location, and items collaboratively.

Result: Online A/B tests showed a 1.54% improvement in GTV, with offline experiments also demonstrating enhancements. STIM is deployed in a large-scale system serving millions of users.

Conclusion: STIM effectively addresses spatio-temporal challenges in recommendation systems, improving performance and scalability for local-life services.

Abstract: In the context of the booming digital economy, recommendation systems, as a
key link connecting users and numerous services, face challenges in modeling
user behavior sequences on local-life service platforms, including the sparsity
of long sequences and strong spatio-temporal dependence. Such challenges can be
addressed by drawing an analogy to the forgetting process in human memory. This
is because users' responses to recommended content follow the recency effect
and the cyclicality of memory. By exploring this, this paper introduces the
forgetting curve and proposes Spatio-Temporal periodic Interest Modeling (STIM)
with long sequences for local-life service recommendation. STIM integrates
three key components: a dynamic masking module based on the forgetting curve,
which is used to extract both recent spatiotemporal features and periodic
spatiotemporal features; a query-based mixture of experts (MoE) approach that
can adaptively activate expert networks under different dynamic masks, enabling
the collaborative modeling of time, location, and items; and a hierarchical
multi-interest network unit, which captures multi-interest representations by
modeling the hierarchical interactions between the shallow and deep semantics
of users' recent behaviors. By introducing the STIM method, we conducted online
A/B tests and achieved a 1.54\% improvement in gross transaction volume (GTV).
In addition, extended offline experiments also showed improvements. STIM has
been deployed in a large-scale local-life service recommendation system,
serving hundreds of millions of daily active users in core application
scenarios.

TL;DR: R3A improves relevance assessment in UGC platforms by decomposing reasoning and leveraging auxiliary documents, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in UGC platforms: ambiguous user intent and noisy unstructured language in RAG scenarios.

Method: Proposes R3A, a decomposed reasoning framework using auxiliary documents and verbatim fragment extraction, optimized via reinforcement learning.

Result: R3A significantly outperforms baselines in relevance accuracy in offline and online experiments.

Conclusion: R3A effectively mitigates distortions from ambiguous queries and noisy content, enhancing relevance assessment.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) plays a critical role in user-generated
content (UGC) platforms, but its effectiveness depends heavily on accurate
relevance assessment of query-document pairs. Despite recent advances in
applying large language models (LLMs) to relevance modeling, UGC platforms
present unique challenges: 1) ambiguous user intent due to sparse user feedback
in RAG scenarios, and 2) substantial noise introduced by informal and
unstructured language. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced
Reasoning Model for Relevance Assessment (R3A), which introduces a decomposed
reasoning framework over queries and candidate documents before scoring. R3A
first leverages auxiliary high-ranked documents within the platform to infer
latent query intent. It then performs verbatim fragment extraction to justify
relevance decisions, thereby reducing errors caused by noisy UGC. Based on a
reinforcement learning framework, R3A is optimized to mitigate distortions
arising from ambiguous queries and unstructured content. Experimental results
show that R3A significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of
relevance accuracy, across both offline benchmarks and online experiments.

*Ziye Jia,Sijie He,Qiuming Zhu,Wei Wang,Qihui Wu,Zhu Han*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a blockchain-based trust management mechanism (BTMM) and a multi-agent double deep Q-network routing algorithm to secure UAV networks and minimize delay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAV networks face routing security challenges due to distributed topologies and high dynamics, requiring robust solutions.

Method: The authors design BTMM for trust evaluation, improve Byzantine fault tolerance, and reformulate routing as a decentralized Markov decision process.

Result: Simulations show the proposed mechanism reduces delay by 13.39%, 12.74%, and 16.6% compared to benchmarks.

Conclusion: The BTMM and routing algorithm effectively enhance UAV network security and performance.

Abstract: Due to the high flexibility and versatility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are leveraged in various fields including surveillance and disaster
rescue.However, in UAV networks, routing is vulnerable to malicious damage due
to distributed topologies and high dynamics. Hence, ensuring the routing
security of UAV networks is challenging. In this paper, we characterize the
routing process in a time-varying UAV network with malicious nodes.
Specifically, we formulate the routing problem to minimize the total delay,
which is an integer linear programming and intractable to solve. Then, to
tackle the network security issue, a blockchain-based trust management
mechanism (BTMM) is designed to dynamically evaluate trust values and identify
low-trust UAVs. To improve traditional practical Byzantine fault tolerance
algorithms in the blockchain, we propose a consensus UAV update mechanism.
Besides, considering the local observability, the routing problem is
reformulated into a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process.
Further, a multi-agent double deep Q-network based routing algorithm is
designed to minimize the total delay. Finally, simulations are conducted with
attacked UAVs and numerical results show that the delay of the proposed
mechanism decreases by 13.39$\%$, 12.74$\%$, and 16.6$\%$ than multi-agent
proximal policy optimal algorithms, multi-agent deep Q-network algorithms, and
methods without BTMM, respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of heterogeneous and combinatorial processes in semiconductor manufacturing for accurate defect root-cause analysis.

Method: PLA attributes defects to upstream processes by comparing best outcomes from partial trajectories, reducing the task to solving a Bellman equation.

Result: PLA effectively predicts defect density and attributes defect scores, demonstrated using real wafer history data.

Conclusion: PLA provides a robust solution for simultaneous defect prediction and root-cause attribution in semiconductor manufacturing.

Abstract: Cross-process root-cause analysis of wafer defects is among the most critical
yet challenging tasks in semiconductor manufacturing due to the heterogeneity
and combinatorial nature of processes along the processing route. This paper
presents a new framework for wafer defect root cause analysis, called Potential
Loss Analysis (PLA), as a significant enhancement of the previously proposed
partial trajectory regression approach. The PLA framework attributes observed
high wafer defect densities to upstream processes by comparing the best
possible outcomes generated by partial processing trajectories. We show that
the task of identifying the best possible outcome can be reduced to solving a
Bellman equation. Remarkably, the proposed framework can simultaneously solve
the prediction problem for defect density as well as the attribution problem
for defect scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
using real wafer history data.

TL;DR: A data-driven method simplifies nonlinear system models using linear approximations and LPV systems, identifying structure via sparse estimators in an RKHS framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overly complex nonlinear models are impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating simpler, data-driven representations.

Method: Proposes linear approximations around operating points, LPV model reduction, and sparse estimators in an RKHS framework to identify nonlinear structure.

Result: Numerical simulations confirm the method's effectiveness in simplifying and accurately representing nonlinear systems.

Conclusion: The approach successfully simplifies nonlinear models by leveraging LPV systems and sparse estimation, validated by simulations.

Abstract: The choice of parameterization in Nonlinear (NL) system models greatly
affects the quality of the estimated model. Overly complex models can be
impractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for
simpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a
data-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models
using linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for
sparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and
their corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate
the unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV)
system, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and
indicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the
NL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV
coefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse
estimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)
framework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural
relationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined
by detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and
the Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two
computationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose. The
sparsified Hessian matrix reveals the NL model's structure, with numerical
simulations confirming the approach's effectiveness.

*Dean Brandner,Sebastien Gros,Sergio Lucia*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Gauss-Newton approximation for MPC in RL to enable superlinear convergence without second-order policy derivatives, improving efficiency and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC in RL offers interpretability and low data needs but suffers from inefficiency due to first-order methods' linear convergence. Second-order methods are impractical due to computational demands.

Method: Introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the policy Hessian to avoid second-order derivatives and a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for robustness.

Result: Demonstrated faster convergence and better data efficiency on a nonlinear CSTR compared to first-order methods.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses inefficiency in MPC-based RL, enabling superlinear convergence with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is widely used in process control due to its
interpretability and ability to handle constraints. As a parametric policy in
reinforcement learning (RL), MPC offers strong initial performance and low data
requirements compared to black-box policies like neural networks. However, most
RL methods rely on first-order updates, which scale well to large parameter
spaces but converge at most linearly, making them inefficient when each policy
update requires solving an optimal control problem, as is the case with MPC.
While MPC policies are typically sparsely parameterized and thus amenable to
second-order approaches, existing second-order methods demand second-order
policy derivatives, which can be computationally and memory-wise intractable.
  This work introduces a Gauss-Newton approximation of the deterministic policy
Hessian that eliminates the need for second-order policy derivatives, enabling
superlinear convergence with minimal computational overhead. To further improve
robustness, we propose a momentum-based Hessian averaging scheme for stable
training under noisy estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
approach on a nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR), showing
faster convergence and improved data efficiency over state-of-the-art

*Karthik Peddi,Sai Ram Aditya Parisineni,Hemanth Macharla,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A new method combines causal inference and machine learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems using graph-based models, achieving high accuracy (99.44%) and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve fault detection and system reliability by understanding the causal relationships behind system failures.

Method: Builds causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE), represents faults as graphs, and classifies them using GraphSAGE. Uses GNNExplainer and Captums Integrated Gradients for interpretability.

Result: Achieves 99.44% accuracy on the EDS fault dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The method accurately predicts faults and provides insights into root causes, making it a practical tool for enhancing system reliability.

Abstract: Causal analysis helps us understand variables that are responsible for system
failures. This improves fault detection and makes system more reliable. In this
work, we present a new method that combines causal inference with machine
learning to classify faults in electrical distribution systems (EDS) using
graph-based models. We first build causal graphs using transfer entropy (TE).
Each fault case is represented as a graph, where the nodes are features such as
voltage and current, and the edges demonstrate how these features influence
each other. Then, the graphs are classified using machine learning and
GraphSAGE where the model learns from both the node values and the structure of
the graph to predict the type of fault. To make the predictions understandable,
we further developed an integrated approach using GNNExplainer and Captums
Integrated Gradients to highlight the nodes (features) that influences the most
on the final prediction. This gives us clear insights into the possible causes
of the fault. Our experiments show high accuracy: 99.44% on the EDS fault
dataset, which is better than state of art models. By combining causal graphs
with machine learning, our method not only predicts faults accurately but also
helps understand their root causes. This makes it a strong and practical tool
for improving system reliability.

*Ziqin He,Mengqi Hu,Yifei Lou,Can Chen*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Tensor Dynamic Mode Decomposition (TDMD) extends DMD to handle third-order tensors, improving efficiency and preserving data structure for multiway data analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional DMD methods are matrix-based, which can be inefficient or inadequate for multidimensional data like images or videos.

Method: TDMD uses tensor factorization techniques within the T-product framework to extend DMD to third-order tensors.

Result: TDMD outperforms standard DMD in tasks like state reconstruction and dynamic component separation, as shown in synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TDMD is a promising extension of DMD for analyzing complex, high-dimensional data with better efficiency and structure preservation.

Abstract: Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a powerful data-driven method for
analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of complex, high-dimensional systems.
However, conventional DMD methods are limited to matrix-based formulations,
which might be inefficient or inadequate for modeling inherently
multidimensional data including images, videos, and higher-order networks. In
this letter, we propose tensor dynamic mode decomposition (TDMD), a novel
extension of DMD to third-order tensors based on the recently developed
T-product framework. By incorporating tensor factorization techniques, TDMD
achieves more efficient computation and better preservation of spatial and
temporal structures in multiway data for tasks such as state reconstruction and
dynamic component separation, compared to standard DMD with data flattening. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TDMD on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dialogue Systems Engineering (DSE) as a subfield of software engineering for dialogue systems, surveys its current state, and outlines future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of large language models has advanced dialogue systems, necessitating specialized software engineering approaches to build, operate, and improve them effectively.

Method: The paper surveys DSE by mapping it to the SWEBOK framework, identifying knowledge areas and gaps.

Result: The study highlights unexplored topics in DSE and suggests future research directions.

Conclusion: DSE is crucial for advancing dialogue systems, requiring tailored software engineering methods and further exploration.

Abstract: This paper proposes to refer to the field of software engineering related to
the life cycle of dialogue systems as Dialogue Systems Engineering, and surveys
this field while also discussing its future directions. With the advancement of
large language models, the core technologies underlying dialogue systems have
significantly progressed. As a result, dialogue system technology is now
expected to be applied to solving various societal issues and in business
contexts. To achieve this, it is important to build, operate, and continuously
improve dialogue systems correctly and efficiently. Accordingly, in addition to
applying existing software engineering knowledge, it is becoming increasingly
important to evolve software engineering tailored specifically to dialogue
systems. In this paper, we enumerate the knowledge areas of dialogue systems
engineering based on those of software engineering, as defined in the Software
Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) Version 4.0, and survey each area. Based
on this survey, we identify unexplored topics in each area and discuss the
future direction of dialogue systems engineering.

TL;DR: MPCO is a framework for automated code optimization across diverse LLMs, addressing cross-model prompt engineering challenges by dynamically generating high-quality prompts. It shows significant performance improvements and actionable insights for industrial use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of prompts optimized for one LLM failing with others limits multi-LLM deployment in production. MPCO aims to solve this bottleneck.

Method: MPCO uses meta-prompting to synthesize context-aware prompts, integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and deploys on the ARTEMIS platform.

Result: MPCO achieves up to 19.06% performance improvement, with 96% of top optimizations from meaningful edits. All major LLMs can serve as meta-prompters.

Conclusion: MPCO effectively addresses cross-model prompt engineering, demonstrating its practicality for industrial deployment with significant performance gains.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in leveraging large language models (LLMs) for
automated code optimization. However, industrial platforms deploying multiple
LLMs face a critical challenge: prompts optimized for one LLM often fail with
others, requiring expensive model-specific prompt engineering. This cross-model
prompt engineering bottleneck severely limits the practical deployment of
multi-LLM optimization systems in production environments. To address this, we
introduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that
automatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs
while maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages
meta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by
integrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and
it seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated
validation and scaling.
  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of
runtime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall
performance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all
systems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the
top-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic
ablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that
comprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,
and that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,
providing actionable insights for industrial practitioners.

*Xinfang Chen,Siyang Xiao,Xianying Zhu,Junhong Xie,Ming Liang,Dajun Chen,Wei Jiang,Yong Li,Peng Di*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NES is an LLM-driven framework for code editing that predicts developer intent without explicit instructions, reducing latency and improving workflow integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI-powered code editing tools rely heavily on human instructions and suffer from high latency, limiting their practicality.

Method: NES uses a dual-model architecture trained with SFT and DAPO datasets to predict next edits based on historical patterns, optimizing for low latency.

Result: NES achieves 75.6% and 81.6% accuracy in predicting edit locations and 91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.

Conclusion: NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution that enhances productivity by understanding developer intent and minimizing latency, with demonstrated success in real-world adoption.

Abstract: Code editing, including modifying, refactoring, and maintaining existing
code, is the most frequent task in software development and has garnered
significant attention from AI-powered tools. However, existing solutions that
translate explicit natural language instructions into code edits face critical
limitations, such as heavy reliance on human instruction input and high
latency, which hinder their effective integration into a developer's workflow.
We observe that developers' habitual behaviors and coding objectives are often
reflected in their historical editing patterns, making this data key to
addressing existing limitations. To leverage these insights, we propose NES
(Next Edit Suggestion), an LLM-driven code editing framework that delivers an
instruction-free and low-latency experience. Built on a dual-model architecture
and trained with our high-quality SFT and DAPO datasets, NES enhances
productivity by understanding developer intent while optimizing inference to
minimize latency. NES is a scalable, industry-ready solution with a continuous
Tab key interaction workflow, seamlessly adopted by a FinTech company with over
20,000 developers. Evaluations on real-world datasets show NES achieves 75.6%
and 81.6% accuracy in two tasks of predicting next edit locations, alongside
91.36% ES and 27.7% EMR for intent-aligned edits, outperforming SOTA models.
Our open-sourced SFT and DAPO datasets have been demonstrated to enhance the
performance of open-source CodeLLMs. The demonstration of NES is available at

*Daniele Cipollone,Egor Bogomolov,Arie van Deursen,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A new scoring method for ranking static code completions using language models, improving IDE suggestions without complex adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code completion systems rely on heuristics or lightweight models, lacking context awareness and generalization.

Method: Organizes valid completions into a prefix tree and uses a single greedy decoding pass for token-level scoring.

Result: Enables precise, token-aware ranking without beam search or model changes, remaining fast and compatible.

Conclusion: Provides a practical way to integrate language models into IDEs for smarter developer assistance.

Abstract: Token-level code completion is one of the most critical features in modern
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). It assists developers by suggesting
relevant identifiers and APIs during coding. While completions are typically
derived from static analysis, their usefulness depends heavily on how they are
ranked, as correct predictions buried deep in the list are rarely seen by
users. Most current systems rely on hand-crafted heuristics or lightweight
machine learning models trained on user logs, which can be further improved to
capture context information and generalize across projects and coding styles.
In this work, we propose a new scoring approach to ranking static completions
using language models in a lightweight and model-agnostic way. Our method
organizes all valid completions into a prefix tree and performs a single greedy
decoding pass to collect token-level scores across the tree. This enables a
precise token-aware ranking without needing beam search, prompt engineering, or
model adaptations. The approach is fast, architecture-agnostic, and compatible
with already deployed models for code completion. These findings highlight a
practical and effective pathway for integrating language models into already
existing tools within IDEs, and ultimately providing smarter and more
responsive developer assistance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of tools and studies addressing ML-specific code smells in ML applications motivated the development of MLpylint.

Method: The research used Design Science Methodology, involving literature reviews, expert consultations, and tool evaluation on 160 open-source ML applications.

Result: MLpylint was found effective and useful, validated by expert surveys and testing.

Conclusion: The study aims to integrate MLpylint into development workflows to enhance productivity and innovation in ML development.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has rapidly grown in popularity, becoming vital to many
industries. Currently, the research on code smells in ML applications lacks
tools and studies that address the identification and validity of ML-specific
code smells. This work investigates suitable methods and tools to design and
develop a static code analysis tool (MLpylint) based on code smell criteria.
This research employed the Design Science Methodology. In the problem
identification phase, a literature review was conducted to identify ML-specific
code smells. In solution design, a secondary literature review and
consultations with experts were performed to select methods and tools for
implementing the tool. We evaluated the tool on data from 160 open-source ML
applications sourced from GitHub. We also conducted a static validation through
an expert survey involving 15 ML professionals. The results indicate the
effectiveness and usefulness of the MLpylint. We aim to extend our current
approach by investigating ways to introduce MLpylint seamlessly into
development workflows, fostering a more productive and innovative developer
environment.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta-RAG, a multi-agent system using LLMs and information retrieval to localize bugs in large codebases, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating bug localization in complex software ecosystems beyond just code implementation.

Method: Proposes Meta-RAG, a Retrieval Augmented Generation approach that condenses codebases into natural language summaries for LLM-based bug localization.

Result: Achieves 84.67% file-level and 53.0% function-level correct localization rates on SWE-bench Lite.

Conclusion: Meta-RAG is effective for bug localization in large codebases, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been at the forefront of applied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research in a multitude of domains. One such
domain is software development, where researchers have pushed the automation of
a number of code tasks through LLM agents. Software development is a complex
ecosystem, that stretches far beyond code implementation and well into the
realm of code maintenance. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system to
localize bugs in large pre-existing codebases using information retrieval and
LLMs. Our system introduces a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
approach, Meta-RAG, where we utilize summaries to condense codebases by an
average of 79.8\%, into a compact, structured, natural language representation.
We then use an LLM agent to determine which parts of the codebase are critical
for bug resolution, i.e. bug localization. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Meta-RAG through evaluation with the SWE-bench Lite dataset. Meta-RAG scores
84.67 % and 53.0 % for file-level and function-level correct localization
rates, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

*Yang Li,Zhi Chen*

Main category: q-fin.CP

TL;DR: ByteGen is a novel generative model for high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics, operating directly on raw byte streams without tokenization, using a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture for realistic market simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LOB modeling rely on simplifying assumptions or tokenization, which compromises data precision. ByteGen aims to eliminate these limitations by learning directly from raw bytes.

Method: ByteGen treats LOB modeling as an autoregressive next-byte prediction task, using a 32-byte packed binary format and a hybrid Mamba-Transformer (H-Net) architecture for dynamic structure discovery.

Result: Trained on CME Bitcoin futures data, ByteGen reproduces key market stylized facts like realistic price distributions and heavy-tailed returns, achieving competitive performance without tokenization biases.

Conclusion: Learning directly from byte space is a flexible and promising paradigm for modeling financial systems, as demonstrated by ByteGen's success in generating realistic LOB dynamics.

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-frequency limit order book (LOB) dynamics is a
critical yet unsolved challenge in quantitative finance, essential for robust
market simulation and strategy backtesting. Existing approaches are often
constrained by simplifying stochastic assumptions or, in the case of modern
deep learning models like Transformers, rely on tokenization schemes that
affect the high-precision, numerical nature of financial data through
discretization and binning. To address these limitations, we introduce ByteGen,
a novel generative model that operates directly on the raw byte streams of LOB
events. Our approach treats the problem as an autoregressive next-byte
prediction task, for which we design a compact and efficient 32-byte packed
binary format to represent market messages without information loss. The core
novelty of our work is the complete elimination of feature engineering and
tokenization, enabling the model to learn market dynamics from its most
fundamental representation. We achieve this by adapting the H-Net architecture,
a hybrid Mamba-Transformer model that uses a dynamic chunking mechanism to
discover the inherent structure of market messages without predefined rules.
Our primary contributions are: 1) the first end-to-end, byte-level framework
for LOB modeling; 2) an efficient packed data representation; and 3) a
comprehensive evaluation on high-frequency data. Trained on over 34 million
events from CME Bitcoin futures, ByteGen successfully reproduces key stylized
facts of financial markets, generating realistic price distributions,
heavy-tailed returns, and bursty event timing. Our findings demonstrate that
learning directly from byte space is a promising and highly flexible paradigm
for modeling complex financial systems, achieving competitive performance on
standard market quality metrics without the biases of tokenization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a structured mapping of Brazilian legislation to the schema.org/Legislation vocabulary using JSON-LD and Linked Data to improve machine readability and interoperability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of structuring legal norms for machine readability, enhancing Legal Tech applications like Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs).

Method: A unified mapping of Brazilian legislation to schema.org/Legislation via JSON-LD and Linked Data, covering conceptual norms and their digital manifestations.

Result: Improved quality and interoperability of Brazilian legal data, fostering global OGD ecosystem integration.

Conclusion: The structured schema facilitates the creation of a more accessible and interconnected legal data framework.

Abstract: Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives aim to enhance transparency and public
participation by making government data openly accessible. However, structuring
legal norms for machine readability remains a critical challenge for advancing
Legal Tech applications such as Legal Knowledge Graphs (LKGs). Focusing on the
Normas.leg.br portal initiative by the Brazilian National Congress, we propose
a unified mapping of Brazilian legislation to the schema.org/Legislation
vocabulary via JSON-LD and Linked Data. Our approach covers both the conceptual
"Norm" entity (mapped to sdo:Legislation) and its digital publications or
manifestations (mapped to sdo:LegislationObject). We detail key properties for
each type, providing concrete examples and considering URN identifiers (per the
LexML standard), multilingual support, versioning in the Official Journal, and
inter-norm relationships (e.g., citations and references). Our structured

*Ilan Strauss,Jangho Yang,Tim O'Reilly,Sruly Rosenblat,Isobel Moure*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: The paper highlights an 'attribution gap' in web-enabled LLMs, where models often fail to cite sources they use, and analyzes patterns of exploitation across models like Gemini, GPT-4o, and Sonar.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of transparency in how LLMs attribute web content, leading to potential exploitation of uncited sources.

Method: Analyzed ~14,000 real-world LMArena conversation logs to document exploitation patterns and used a negative binomial hurdle model to quantify uncited gaps.

Result: Found significant uncited gaps (e.g., Gemini leaves ~3 relevant sites uncited per query), with citation efficiency varying widely (0.19-0.45). GPT-4o's small gap is likely due to selective logging.

Conclusion: Recommends a transparent LLM search architecture with standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs to improve attribution.

Abstract: Web-enabled LLMs frequently answer queries without crediting the web pages
they consume, creating an "attribution gap" - the difference between relevant
URLs read and those actually cited. Drawing on approximately 14,000 real-world
LMArena conversation logs with search-enabled LLM systems, we document three
exploitation patterns: 1) No Search: 34% of Google Gemini and 24% of OpenAI
GPT-4o responses are generated without explicitly fetching any online content;
2) No citation: Gemini provides no clickable citation source in 92% of answers;
3) High-volume, low-credit: Perplexity's Sonar visits approximately 10 relevant
pages per query but cites only three to four. A negative binomial hurdle model
shows that the average query answered by Gemini or Sonar leaves about 3
relevant websites uncited, whereas GPT-4o's tiny uncited gap is best explained
by its selective log disclosures rather than by better attribution. Citation
efficiency - extra citations provided per additional relevant web page visited
- varies widely across models, from 0.19 to 0.45 on identical queries,
underscoring that retrieval design, not technical limits, shapes ecosystem
impact. We recommend a transparent LLM search architecture based on
standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore patents as structured knowledge containers and address modern challenges like AI inventorship, biotech ownership, and global competition.

Method: Critical analysis of AI's impact on patent authorship, biotech ethical dilemmas, and strategic patent use in global innovation.

Result: Identified needs for better information organization, metadata standards, retrieval systems, and ethical considerations in patenting.

Conclusion: Calls for collaborative, transparent, and ethical patent management to ensure equitable access in innovation.

Abstract: In an age of fast-paced technological change, patents have evolved into not
only legal mechanisms of intellectual property, but also structured storage
containers of knowledge full of metadata, categories, and formal innovation.
This chapter proposes to reframe patents in the context of information science,
by focusing on patents as knowledge artifacts, and by seeing patents as
fundamentally tied to the global movement of scientific and technological
knowledge. With a focus on three areas, the inventions of AIs, biotech patents,
and international competition with patents, this work considers how new
technologies are challenging traditional notions of inventorship, access, and
moral accountability.The chapter provides a critical analysis of AI's
implications for patent authorship and prior art searches, ownership issues
arising from proprietary claims in biotechnology to ethical dilemmas, and the
problem of using patents for strategic advantage in a global context of
innovation competition. In this analysis, the chapter identified the importance
of organizing information, creating metadata standards about originality,
implementing retrieval systems to access previous works, and ethical
contemplation about patenting unseen relationships in innovation ecosystems.
Ultimately, the chapter called for a collaborative, transparent, and
ethically-based approach in managing knowledge in the patenting environment
highlighting the role for information professionals and policy to contribute to
access equity in innovation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes an ontology-driven framework for the SSBD to improve metadata management and interoperability in bioimaging, using a two-tier architecture for flexible yet rigorous data integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in metadata management and interoperability in bioimaging due to large-scale multidimensional data acquisition.

Method: A two-tier architecture: core layer (class-centric, referencing biomedical ontologies) and instance layer (RDF individuals linked to core classes).

Result: Enables seamless integration, advanced semantic queries, and aligns with metadata guidelines, promoting FAIR data principles.

Conclusion: The SSBD Ontology enhances interoperability, data reuse, and discovery of biological mechanisms, contributing to a FAIR data ecosystem.

Abstract: Advanced bioimaging technologies have enabled the large-scale acquisition of
multidimensional data, yet effective metadata management and interoperability
remain significant challenges. To address these issues, we propose a new
ontology-driven framework for the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics
Database (SSBD) that adopts a two-tier architecture. The core layer provides a
class-centric structure referencing existing biomedical ontologies, supporting
both SSBD:repository -- which focuses on rapid dataset publication with minimal
metadata -- and SSBD:database, which is enhanced with biological and
imaging-related annotations. Meanwhile, the instance layer represents actual
imaging dataset information as Resource Description Framework individuals that
are explicitly linked to the core classes. This layered approach aligns
flexible instance data with robust ontological classes, enabling seamless
integration and advanced semantic queries. By coupling flexibility with rigor,
the SSBD Ontology promotes interoperability, data reuse, and the discovery of
novel biological mechanisms. Moreover, our solution aligns with the Recommended
Metadata for Biological Images guidelines and fosters compatibility.
Ultimately, our approach contributes to establishing a Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable data ecosystem within the bioimaging community.

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: Bike-Bench is a benchmark for evaluating generative AI models in engineering design, focusing on multi-objective and constrained problems. It assesses performance in aerodynamics, ergonomics, and more, using datasets of simulations and human-rated designs. Results show LLMs and tabular models lag behind optimization-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for evaluating generative AI's ability to handle real-world engineering design challenges, including physical laws, human guidelines, and constraints.

Method: Bike-Bench quantifies human-centered and multiphysics performance metrics (e.g., aerodynamics, ergonomics) and uses datasets of simulations, human-rated bicycle assessments, and synthetically-generated designs. It evaluates tabular models, LLMs, and hybrid algorithms.

Result: LLMs and tabular generative models underperform compared to optimization and optimization-augmented models in validity and optimality.

Conclusion: Bike-Bench aims to advance generative AI for constrained multi-objective engineering design, highlighting gaps in current models and providing a foundation for future improvements.

Abstract: We introduce Bike-Bench, an engineering design benchmark for evaluating
generative models on problems with multiple real-world objectives and
constraints. As generative AI's reach continues to grow, evaluating its
capability to understand physical laws, human guidelines, and hard constraints
grows increasingly important. Engineering product design lies at the
intersection of these difficult tasks, providing new challenges for AI
capabilities. Bike-Bench evaluates AI models' capability to generate designs
that not only resemble the dataset, but meet specific performance objectives
and constraints. To do so, Bike-Bench quantifies a variety of human-centered
and multiphysics performance characteristics, such as aerodynamics, ergonomics,
structural mechanics, human-rated usability, and similarity to subjective text
or image prompts. Supporting the benchmark are several datasets of simulation
results, a dataset of 10K human-rated bicycle assessments, and a
synthetically-generated dataset of 1.4M designs, each with a parametric,
CAD/XML, SVG, and PNG representation. Bike-Bench is uniquely configured to
evaluate tabular generative models, LLMs, design optimization, and hybrid
algorithms side-by-side. Our experiments indicate that LLMs and tabular
generative models fall short of optimization and optimization-augmented
generative models in both validity and optimality scores, suggesting
significant room for improvement. We hope Bike-Bench, a first-of-its-kind
benchmark, will help catalyze progress in generative AI for constrained
multi-objective engineering design problems. Code, data, and other resources

TL;DR: EngiBench and EngiOpt are introduced as open-source tools for data-driven engineering design, offering a unified API, benchmarks, and algorithms to streamline optimization and machine learning in diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenges of physics-based simulations in engineering design—such as installation difficulty, computational expense, and domain expertise—motivate the need for accessible, data-driven alternatives.

Method: EngiBench provides a unified API and curated benchmarks, while EngiOpt offers compatible optimization and machine learning algorithms. Both libraries support modularity, automation, and utilities for visualization and analysis.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the libraries' versatility in comparing state-of-the-art techniques across engineering problems, revealing challenges for standard machine learning methods due to sensitive and constrained design manifolds.

Conclusion: EngiBench and EngiOpt enable reproducible, efficient engineering design optimization, addressing gaps in accessibility and performance for data-driven approaches.

Abstract: Engineering design optimization seeks to automatically determine the shapes,
topologies, or parameters of components that maximize performance under given
conditions. This process often depends on physics-based simulations, which are
difficult to install, computationally expensive, and require domain-specific
expertise. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce EngiBench, the first
open-source library and datasets spanning diverse domains for data-driven
engineering design. EngiBench provides a unified API and a curated set of
benchmarks -- covering aeronautics, heat conduction, photonics, and more --
that enable fair, reproducible comparisons of optimization and machine learning
algorithms, such as generative or surrogate models. We also release EngiOpt, a
companion library offering a collection of such algorithms compatible with the
EngiBench interface. Both libraries are modular, letting users plug in novel
algorithms or problems, automate end-to-end experiment workflows, and leverage
built-in utilities for visualization, dataset generation, feasibility checks,
and performance analysis. We demonstrate their versatility through experiments
comparing state-of-the-art techniques across multiple engineering design
problems, an undertaking that was previously prohibitively time-consuming to
perform. Finally, we show that these problems pose significant challenges for
standard machine learning methods due to highly sensitive and constrained
design manifolds.

### [644] [Deep Kernel Bayesian Optimisation for Closed-Loop Electrode Microstructure Design with User-Defined Properties based on GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00833)
*Andrea Gayon-Lombardo,Ehecatl A. del Rio-Chanona,Catalina A. Pino-Munoz,Nigel P. Brandon*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: A closed-loop algorithm using a Generative Adversarial Network and Bayesian optimization designs optimized porous electrode microstructures for lithium-ion batteries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve electrochemical energy storage devices by optimizing electrode microstructures, which directly impact battery performance.

Method: Uses a deep convolutional GAN to generate synthetic 3D microstructures, Gaussian Process Regression as a surrogate model, and Bayesian optimization to tailor properties.

Result: Demonstrated simultaneous maximization of correlated properties (specific surface area and diffusivity) and constrained optimization.

Conclusion: The framework enables fast generation of realistic microstructures with customized properties, enhancing battery design.

Abstract: The generation of multiphase porous electrode microstructures with optimum
morphological and transport properties is essential in the design of improved
electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium-ion batteries.
Electrode characteristics directly influence battery performance by acting as
the main sites where the electrochemical reactions coupled with transport
processes occur. This work presents a generation-optimisation closed-loop
algorithm for the design of microstructures with tailored properties. A deep
convolutional Generative Adversarial Network is used as a deep kernel and
employed to generate synthetic three-phase three-dimensional images of a porous
lithium-ion battery cathode material. A Gaussian Process Regression uses the
latent space of the generator and serves as a surrogate model to correlate the
morphological and transport properties of the synthetic microstructures. This
surrogate model is integrated into a deep kernel Bayesian optimisation
framework, which optimises cathode properties as a function of the latent space
of the generator. A set of objective functions were defined to perform the
maximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific
surface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate
the ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties
(specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained
optimisation of these properties. This is the maximisation of morphological or
transport properties constrained by constant values of the volume fraction of
the phase of interest. Visualising the optimised latent space reveals its
correlation with morphological properties, enabling the fast generation of
visually realistic microstructures with customised properties.

*Nianyi Wang,Yu Chen,Shuai Zheng*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper introduces FluidFormer, a Transformer-based architecture for fluid simulation, combining local and global features to improve stability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural methods for fluid simulation rely on local interactions, but global context is crucial for stability in complex scenarios.

Method: Proposes Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with local-global hierarchy: continuous convolutions for local features and self-attention for global dependencies. Uses a dual-pipeline architecture with a Transformer.

Result: FluidFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with enhanced stability in complex fluid simulations.

Conclusion: The method unifies local and global modeling, setting a new paradigm for neural fluid simulation.

Abstract: Learning-based fluid simulation networks have been proven as viable
alternatives to traditional numerical solvers for the Navier-Stokes equations.
Existing neural methods follow Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)
frameworks, which inherently rely only on local inter-particle interactions.
However, we emphasize that global context integration is also essential for
learning-based methods to stabilize complex fluid simulations. We propose the
first Fluid Attention Block (FAB) with a local-global hierarchy, where
continuous convolutions extract local features while self-attention captures
global dependencies. This fusion suppresses the error accumulation and models
long-range physical phenomena. Furthermore, we pioneer the first Transformer
architecture specifically designed for continuous fluid simulation, seamlessly
integrated within a dual-pipeline architecture. Our method establishes a new
paradigm for neural fluid simulation by unifying convolution-based local
features with attention-based global context modeling. FluidFormer demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, with stronger stability in complex fluid
scenarios.

### [646] [Managing Escalation in Off-the-Shelf Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01056)
*Sebastian Elbaum,Jonathan Panther*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: Simple interventions can mitigate escalatory tendencies in large language models (LLMs) used for national security, making calls to restrict their use premature.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the escalatory risks of off-the-shelf LLMs in national security applications while acknowledging their inevitable adoption.

Method: Two non-technical interventions tested in a wargame design to reduce escalation.

Result: Substantial reduction in escalation, demonstrating feasibility of aligning LLMs with security goals.

Conclusion: Proactive measures, not restrictions, are needed to align LLMs with national security objectives.

Abstract: U.S. national security customers have begun to utilize large language models,
including enterprise versions of ``off-the-shelf'' models (e.g., ChatGPT)
familiar to the public. This uptake will likely accelerate. However, recent
studies suggest that off-the-shelf large language models frequently suggest
escalatory actions when prompted with geopolitical or strategic scenarios. We
demonstrate two simple, non-technical interventions to control these
tendencies. Introducing these interventions into the experimental wargame
design of a recent study, we substantially reduce escalation throughout the
game. Calls to restrict the use of large language models in national security
applications are thus premature. The U.S. government is already, and will
continue, employing large language models for scenario planning and suggesting
courses of action. Rather than warning against such applications, this study
acknowledges the imminent adoption of large language models, and provides
actionable measures to align them with national security goals, including
escalation management.

### [647] [Conquering High Packet-Loss Erasure: MoE Swin Transformer-Based Video Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01205)
*Lei Teng,Senran Fan,Chen Dong,Haotai Liang,Zhicheng Bao,Xiaodong Xu,Rui Meng,Ping Zhang*

Main category: cs.ET

TL;DR: The paper proposes MSTVSC, a packet-loss-resistant video semantic communication system using MoE Swin Transformer and 3D CNN to mitigate semantic loss from packet drops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protocols discard erroneous packets, leading to semantic information loss in packet-based systems.

Method: MSTVSC encodes semantic vectors, uses 3D CNN for recovery, employs semantic-level interleaving, and adopts common-individual decomposition for compression.

Result: Achieves MS-SSIM >0.6 and PSNR >20 dB at 90% packet loss rate.

Conclusion: MSTVSC effectively addresses semantic loss in packet-based systems with robust performance.

Abstract: Semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding robustly transmits
diverse data modalities but faces challenges in mitigating semantic information
loss due to packet drops in packet-based systems. Under current protocols,
packets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing
erroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a
packet-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication
(MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by
MSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To
investigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the
packetization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by
packet loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using
un-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level
interleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet
drops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is
adopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize
redundancy. The model is lightweighted for practical deployment. Extensive
simulations and comparisons demonstrate strong performance, achieving an
MS-SSIM greater than 0.6 and a PSNR exceeding 20 dB at a 90% packet loss rate.

*Luiz Emilio Allem,Konstantin Avrachenkov,Carlos Hoppen,Hariprasad Manjunath,Lucas Siviero Sibemberg*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: A spectral clustering algorithm is introduced for community recovery in the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with homogeneous communities, proving weak and strong consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address community recovery in dense graphs with homogeneous communities using spectral methods.

Method: A spectral clustering algorithm embeds graphs into ℝ^(k-1) using adjacency matrix eigenvectors, followed by k-means clustering and local refinement.

Result: Weak consistency is proven, and strong consistency is achieved with a local refinement step.

Conclusion: The algorithm effectively recovers communities in SGBM, with theoretical guarantees on consistency.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the soft geometric block model (SGBM) with a fixed
number $k \geq 2$ of homogeneous communities in the dense regime, and we
introduce a spectral clustering algorithm for community recovery on graphs
generated by this model. Given such a graph, the algorithm produces an
embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{k-1}$ using the eigenvectors associated with the
$k-1$ eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph that are closest to a
value determined by the parameters of the model. It then applies $k$-means
clustering to the embedding. We prove weak consistency and show that a simple
local refinement step ensures strong consistency. A key ingredient is an
application of a non-standard version of Davis-Kahan theorem to control
eigenspace perturbations when eigenvalues are not simple. We also analyze the
limiting spectrum of the adjacency matrix, using a combination of combinatorial
and matrix techniques.

*Yanmei Hu,Siyuan Yin,Yihang Wu,Xue Yue,Yue Liu*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Proposes FNGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network Framework, to accurately identify influential nodes in complex networks by leveraging feature networks and local centralities, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for identifying influential nodes in networks are limited by focusing on single aspects of structure or using inefficient global centralities, and ignore relationships between centralities.

Method: Develops FNGCN, a framework combining shallow and deep GCNs, using feature networks to represent relationships among local centralities and reduce noise.

Result: FNGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accurately identifying influential nodes, validated by experiments on real-world networks using the SIR model.

Conclusion: FNGCN is an effective framework for identifying influential nodes in complex networks, addressing limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is of great importance, and
has many applications in practice. For example, finding influential nodes in
e-commerce network can provide merchants with customers with strong purchase
intent; identifying influential nodes in computer information system can help
locating the components that cause the system break down and identifying
influential nodes in these networks can accelerate the flow of information in
networks. Thus, a lot of efforts have been made on the problem of indentifying
influential nodes. However, previous efforts either consider only one aspect of
the network structure, or using global centralities with high time consuming as
node features to identify influential nodes, and the existing methods do not
consider the relationships between different centralities. To solve these
problems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature
Network, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as
GCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency,
FNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among
the local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are
determined. By taking a shallow GCN and a deep GCN into the FNGCN framework,
two FNGCNs are developed. With ground truth obtained from the widely used
Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model, the two FNGCNs are compared with
the state-of-art methods on several real-world networks. Experimental results
show that the two FNGCNs can identify the influential nodes more accurately
than the compared methods, indicating that the proposed framework is effective
in identifying influential nodes in complex networks.

### [651] [Learned LSM-trees: Two Approaches Using Learned Bloom Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00882)
*Nicholas Fidalgo,Puyuan Ye*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating machine learning into LSM-trees to reduce read amplification, proposing two methods: a classifier to bypass Bloom filters and learned Bloom filters for memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LSM-trees optimize writes but suffer from read amplification. Traditional solutions like Bloom filters scale poorly in memory. Learned data structures offer adaptive, efficient alternatives.

Method: Two approaches: 1) a classifier to skip Bloom filter probes, reducing latency; 2) learned Bloom filters to cut memory usage. Implemented on a Monkey-style LSM-tree with leveled compaction.

Result: Classifier reduces GET latency by 2.28x, skipping 30% of Bloom checks. Learned Bloom filters cut memory by 70-80% with zero false negatives.

Conclusion: Learned components in LSM-trees balance latency, memory, and correctness, demonstrating their potential in write-optimized storage systems.

Abstract: Modern key-value stores rely heavily on Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees for
write optimization, but this design introduces significant read amplification.
Auxiliary structures like Bloom filters help, but impose memory costs that
scale with tree depth and dataset size. Recent advances in learned data
structures suggest that machine learning models can augment or replace these
components, trading handcrafted heuristics for data-adaptive behavior. In this
work, we explore two approaches for integrating learned predictions into the
LSM-tree lookup path. The first uses a classifier to selectively bypass Bloom
filter probes for irrelevant levels, aiming to reduce average-case query
latency. The second replaces traditional Bloom filters with compact learned
models and small backup filters, targeting memory footprint reduction without
compromising correctness. We implement both methods atop a Monkey-style
LSM-tree with leveled compaction, per-level Bloom filters, and realistic
workloads. Our experiments show that the classifier reduces GET latency by up
to 2.28x by skipping over 30% of Bloom filter checks with high precision,
though it incurs a modest false-negative rate. The learned Bloom filter design
achieves zero false negatives and retains baseline latency while cutting memory
usage per level by 70-80%. Together, these designs illustrate complementary
trade-offs between latency, memory, and correctness, and highlight the
potential of learned index components in write-optimized storage systems.

### [652] [Instance-Optimal Uniformity Testing and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02637)
*Guy Blanc,Clément L. Canonne,Erik Waingarten*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: The paper introduces uniformity tracking, a new problem addressing limitations in uniformity testing, and presents a polylog(opt)-competitive algorithm for it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniformity testing fails to capture many scenarios of interest and may lead to suboptimal performance due to its gap problem definition.

Method: The authors propose uniformity tracking, requiring detection of deviations from uniformity with minimal samples, and leverage structural results on Poisson mixtures.

Result: A polylog(opt)-competitive uniformity tracking algorithm is developed.

Conclusion: The new problem and algorithm address shortcomings of uniformity testing, with potential broader applications.

Abstract: In the uniformity testing task, an algorithm is provided with samples from an
unknown probability distribution over a (known) finite domain, and must decide
whether it is the uniform distribution, or, alternatively, if its total
variation distance from uniform exceeds some input distance parameter. This
question has received a significant amount of interest and its complexity is,
by now, fully settled. Yet, we argue that it fails to capture many scenarios of
interest, and that its very definition as a gap problem in terms of a
prespecified distance may lead to suboptimal performance.
  To address these shortcomings, we introduce the problem of uniformity
tracking, whereby an algorithm is required to detect deviations from uniformity
(however they may manifest themselves) using as few samples as possible, and be
competitive against an optimal algorithm knowing the distribution profile in
hindsight. Our main contribution is a
$\operatorname{polylog}(\operatorname{opt})$-competitive uniformity tracking
algorithm. We obtain this result by leveraging new structural results on
Poisson mixtures, which we believe to be of independent interest.

Motivation: Addresses limitations in existing methods, such as small dataset scale and loss of 3D structural info during serialization.

Method: Introduces Primitive-Mesh decomposition and local mesh assembly training to enhance LLMs' mesh topology capture.

Result: Creates a 1500k+ sample dataset, outperforms LLaMA-Mesh in generation quality and shape understanding.

Conclusion: MeshLLM shows great potential for text-serialized 3D mesh processing.

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach
addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,
highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify the creation of life-like clothed human avatars without expensive multi-view setups or specialized 3D editing.

Method: Uses Image Layers setup with a single RGB camera, reconstructs and aligns garments in a shared coordinate system, and refines boundaries with collision-aware optimization and implicit neural fields.

Result: Achieves nearly penetration-free 3D clothed humans, competitive with category-specific methods, and works for diverse clothing styles.

Conclusion: ReMu offers a practical, template-free solution for multi-layer 3D garment reconstruction, suitable for varied clothing styles.

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

TL;DR: MCG-IMM is a plug-and-play method for diverse in-betweening human motion generation, enhancing pretrained models without extra parameters via multi-criteria guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in generating diverse motion sequences while maintaining smooth transitions, especially within a batch sampling.

Method: MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process as a multi-criteria optimization problem, ensuring diversity and smoothness without additional parameters.

Result: MCG-IMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four human motion datasets.

Conclusion: MCG-IMM is a versatile, effective solution for diverse in-betweening motion generation, compatible with various generative models.

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art
methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

### [656] [Uncertainty Estimation for Novel Views in Gaussian Splatting from Primitive-Based Representations of Error and Visibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02443)
*Thomas Gottwald,Edgar Heinert,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel method for uncertainty estimation in Gaussian Splatting is proposed, using primitive representations of error and visibility from training views. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for foreground objects, and generalizes to new scenes without requiring holdout data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty estimation is vital for critical applications like robotics and medicine, but existing methods rely on variance estimation and rendering processes, which may not capture meaningful uncertainty information.

Method: The method projects training error and visibility onto Gaussian primitives to create uncertainty representations. These are rendered for novel views, and pixel-wise regression on holdout data aggregates uncertainty feature maps.

Result: The method achieves high correlation with true errors, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques, particularly for foreground objects. Regression models generalize to new scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively estimates uncertainty in Gaussian Splatting, offering improved performance and generalization, making it suitable for critical applications.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

### [659] [Generative AI as a Geopolitical Factor in Industry 5.0: Sovereignty, Access, and Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00973)
*Azmine Toushik Wasi,Enjamamul Haque Eram,Sabrina Afroz Mitu,Md Manjurul Ahsan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper explores the strategic role of Generative AI (GenAI) in Industry 5.0, highlighting its geopolitical impact, governance challenges, and the need for balanced international coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how GenAI and autonomous systems in Industry 5.0 influence global power dynamics, sovereignty, and ethical governance.

Method: Analyzes technological, economic, and ethical perspectives to propose a framework for GenAI's geopolitical implications.

Result: Identifies conflicts between human-centric values and GenAI autonomy, emphasizing governance challenges and geopolitical weaponization.

Conclusion: Calls for governance models balancing national autonomy with international coordination to uphold human-centric values in an AI-driven world.

Abstract: Industry 5.0 marks a new phase in industrial evolution, emphasizing
human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience through the integration of
advanced technologies. Within this evolving landscape, Generative AI (GenAI)
and autonomous systems are not only transforming industrial processes but also
emerging as pivotal geopolitical instruments. We examine strategic implications
of GenAI in Industry 5.0, arguing that these technologies have become national
assets central to sovereignty, access, and global influence. As countries
compete for AI supremacy, growing disparities in talent, computational
infrastructure, and data access are reshaping global power hierarchies and
accelerating the fragmentation of the digital economy. The human-centric ethos
of Industry 5.0, anchored in collaboration between humans and intelligent
systems, increasingly conflicts with the autonomy and opacity of GenAI, raising
urgent governance challenges related to meaningful human control, dual-use
risks, and accountability. We analyze how these dynamics influence defense
strategies, industrial competitiveness, and supply chain resilience, including
the geopolitical weaponization of export controls and the rise of data
sovereignty. Our contribution synthesizes technological, economic, and ethical
perspectives to propose a comprehensive framework for navigating the
intersection of GenAI and geopolitics. We call for governance models that
balance national autonomy with international coordination while safeguarding
human-centric values in an increasingly AI-driven world.

### [661] [Recognising, Anticipating, and Mitigating LLM Pollution of Online Behavioural Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01390)
*Raluca Rilla,Tobias Werner,Hiromu Yakura,Iyad Rahwan,Anne-Marie Nussberger*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'LLM Pollution' as a threat to online behavioral research due to participants using LLMs for tasks, leading to validity issues. Three variants are described: Partial LLM Mediation, Full LLM Delegation, and LLM Spillover. The paper proposes a multi-layered response to mitigate these threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to address the emerging threat of LLM Pollution, which compromises the validity and integrity of online behavioral research by distorting human outputs and introducing biases.

Method: The method involves identifying and analyzing three variants of LLM Pollution (Partial Mediation, Full Delegation, Spillover) and their interactions, along with proposing solutions.

Result: The result highlights how LLM Pollution distorts research validity through automation and reactivity effects, creating biases and undermining authenticity.

Conclusion: The conclusion calls for coordinated adaptation among researchers, platforms, and communities to safeguard methodological integrity in online behavioral research.

Abstract: Online behavioural research faces an emerging threat as participants
increasingly turn to large language models (LLMs) for advice, translation, or
task delegation: LLM Pollution. We identify three interacting variants through
which LLM Pollution threatens the validity and integrity of online behavioural
research. First, Partial LLM Mediation occurs when participants make selective
use of LLMs for specific aspects of a task, such as translation or wording
support, leading researchers to (mis)interpret LLM-shaped outputs as human
ones. Second, Full LLM Delegation arises when agentic LLMs complete studies
with little to no human oversight, undermining the central premise of
human-subject research at a more foundational level. Third, LLM Spillover
signifies human participants altering their behaviour as they begin to
anticipate LLM presence in online studies, even when none are involved. While
Partial Mediation and Full Delegation form a continuum of increasing
automation, LLM Spillover reflects second-order reactivity effects. Together,
these variants interact and generate cascading distortions that compromise
sample authenticity, introduce biases that are difficult to detect post hoc,
and ultimately undermine the epistemic grounding of online research on human
cognition and behaviour. Crucially, the threat of LLM Pollution is already
co-evolving with advances in generative AI, creating an escalating
methodological arms race. To address this, we propose a multi-layered response
spanning researcher practices, platform accountability, and community efforts.
As the challenge evolves, coordinated adaptation will be essential to safeguard
methodological integrity and preserve the validity of online behavioural
research.

*Minghan Li,Congcong Wen,Yu Tian,Min Shi,Yan Luo,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces FairFedMed, a benchmark for fairness in medical Federated Learning (FL), and proposes FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework that improves both performance and fairness in medical image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing fairness in healthcare FL, where heterogeneous data and lack of focus on medical applications pose challenges.

Method: Established FairFedMed benchmark with two datasets (FairFedMed-Oph and FairFedMed-Chest) and proposed FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework using SVD-based low-rank approximation.

Result: FairLoRA achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves fairness across diverse populations.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in fairness for medical FL, providing a benchmark and effective framework (FairLoRA) for equitable healthcare AI.

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to
services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While
Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving
approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to
heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily
addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first
experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six
representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging
modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically
designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:
FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six
demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real
cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they
support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and
demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and
overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose
FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank
approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group
while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.
Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but
also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and
dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

*Andrea Gaggioli,Giuseppe Casaburi,Leonardo Ercolani,Francesco Collova',Pietro Torre,Fabrizio Davide*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The study evaluates five LLMs for automated essay scoring in higher education, finding low human-LLM agreement and weak reliability, suggesting LLMs struggle with contextual and disciplinary tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability and validity of advanced LLMs for automated essay scoring in a real-world academic setting.

Method: Analyzed 67 Italian-language essays using a four-criterion rubric, with each model scoring essays across three replications to measure stability and agreement.

Result: Low human-LLM agreement, weak within-model reliability, and systematic scoring divergences were observed. Inter-model agreement varied by criterion.

Conclusion: Current LLMs may not replicate human judgment well for tasks requiring contextual sensitivity, emphasizing the need for human oversight in academic evaluations.

Abstract: This study investigates the reliability and validity of five advanced Large
Language Models (LLMs), Claude 3.5, DeepSeek v2, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4, and Mistral
24B, for automated essay scoring in a real world higher education context. A
total of 67 Italian-language student essays, written as part of a university
psychology course, were evaluated using a four-criterion rubric (Pertinence,
Coherence, Originality, Feasibility). Each model scored all essays across three
prompt replications to assess intra-model stability. Human-LLM agreement was
consistently low and non-significant (Quadratic Weighted Kappa), and
within-model reliability across replications was similarly weak (median
Kendall's W < 0.30). Systematic scoring divergences emerged, including a
tendency to inflate Coherence and inconsistent handling of context-dependent
dimensions. Inter-model agreement analysis revealed moderate convergence for
Coherence and Originality, but negligible concordance for Pertinence and
Feasibility. Although limited in scope, these findings suggest that current
LLMs may struggle to replicate human judgment in tasks requiring disciplinary
insight and contextual sensitivity. Human oversight remains critical when
evaluating open-ended academic work, particularly in interpretive domains.

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: A pre-training method for protein-ligand interaction prediction improves accuracy by incorporating solvent-dependent conformational ensembles and multi-task learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with solvent-dependent conformational changes and multi-task learning, limiting their effectiveness in drug discovery.

Method: The method uses ligand conformational ensembles under diverse solvent conditions, integrating molecular reconstruction, interatomic distance prediction, and contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves 3.7% better binding affinity prediction, 82% success rate on docking benchmarks, and 97.1% AUC in virtual screening.

Conclusion: The framework advances drug design with solvent-aware, multi-task modeling and atomic-level docking accuracy.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand interactions is essential for
computer-aided drug discovery. However, existing methods often fail to capture
solvent-dependent conformational changes and lack the ability to jointly learn
multiple related tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce a
pre-training method that incorporates ligand conformational ensembles generated
under diverse solvent conditions as augmented input. This design enables the
model to learn both structural flexibility and environmental context in a
unified manner. The training process integrates molecular reconstruction to
capture local geometry, interatomic distance prediction to model spatial
relationships, and contrastive learning to build solvent-invariant molecular
representations. Together, these components lead to significant improvements,
including a 3.7% gain in binding affinity prediction, an 82% success rate on
the PoseBusters Astex docking benchmarks, and an area under the curve of 97.1%
in virtual screening. The framework supports solvent-aware, multi-task modeling
and produces consistent results across benchmarks. A case study further
demonstrates sub-angstrom docking accuracy with a root-mean-square deviation of
0.157 angstroms, offering atomic-level insight into binding mechanisms and
advancing structure-based drug design.

*Paul N. Patrone,Anthony J. Kearsley*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper proposes an objective function to bound uncertainties in medical diagnostics, using a set-theoretic approach and Gershgorin circle theorem for uniform error bounds in classification and prevalence estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing uncertainties in medical diagnostics by bounding errors in classification and prevalence estimation.

Method: Uses a set-theoretic perspective, Gershgorin circle theorem, and measure-theoretic optimization to minimize error bounds.

Result: Demonstrates that the largest Gershgorin radius provides uniform error bounds, with optimization in a binary setting.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for binary classification but faces challenges in multi-class generalization.

Abstract: Motivated by canonical problems in medical diagnostics, we propose and study
properties of an objective function that uniformly bounds uncertainties in
quantities of interest extracted from classifiers and related data analysis
tools. We begin by adopting a set-theoretic perspective to show how two main
tasks in diagnostics -- classification and prevalence estimation -- can be
recast in terms of a variation on the confusion (or error) matrix ${\boldsymbol
{\rm P}}$ typically considered in supervised learning. We then combine
arguments from conditional probability with the Gershgorin circle theorem to
demonstrate that the largest Gershgorin radius $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ of the
matrix $\mathbb I-\boldsymbol {\rm P}$ (where $\mathbb I$ is the identity)
yields uniform error bounds for both classification and prevalence estimation.
In a two-class setting, $\boldsymbol \rho_m$ is minimized via a
measure-theoretic ``water-leveling'' argument that optimizes an appropriately
defined partition $U$ generating the matrix ${\boldsymbol {\rm P}}$. We also
consider an example that illustrates the difficulty of generalizing the binary
solution to a multi-class setting and deduce relevant properties of the
confusion matrix.

*Yan Sun,Faming Liang*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: A novel post-processing approach using stochastic neural networks (StoNet) to quantify uncertainty in deep neural network predictions, offering theoretical guarantees and improved performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs) remains unresolved, necessitating a reliable method for accurate prediction intervals.

Method: Feed the last hidden layer output of a pre-trained DNN into a StoNet, train it with a sparse penalty on validation data, and construct prediction intervals.

Result: The approach produces honest confidence intervals with shorter lengths than conformal methods and better calibration than other post-hoc techniques.

Conclusion: The StoNet-based method effectively addresses uncertainty quantification in DNNs, with theoretical support and practical advantages.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized modern data science. However, how to
accurately quantify the uncertainty of predictions from large-scale deep neural
networks (DNNs) remains an unresolved issue. To address this issue, we
introduce a novel post-processing approach. This approach feeds the output from
the last hidden layer of a pre-trained large-scale DNN model into a stochastic
neural network (StoNet), then trains the StoNet with a sparse penalty on a
validation dataset and constructs prediction intervals for future observations.
We establish a theoretical guarantee for the validity of this approach; in
particular, the parameter estimation consistency for the sparse StoNet is
essential for the success of this approach. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed approach can construct honest confidence
intervals with shorter interval lengths compared to conformal methods and
achieves better calibration compared to other post-hoc calibration techniques.
Additionally, we show that the StoNet formulation provides us with a platform
to adapt sparse learning theory and methods from linear models to DNNs.

*Marc Braun,Jose M. Peña,Adel Daoud*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces Flow IV, a method for counterfactual inference in nonseparable models using instrumental variables (IVs) and normalizing flows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving human-level intelligence requires causal reasoning, but counterfactual reasoning is challenging. The paper addresses this by leveraging IVs to identify causality.

Method: The approach assumes strict monotonicity and joint Gaussianity of latent noises in treatment and outcome. A normalizing flow is trained to maximize observed data likelihood.

Result: The method uniquely identifies the treatment-outcome relationship, enabling accurate counterfactual inference in nonseparable models.

Conclusion: Flow IV successfully recovers the underlying outcome function, advancing counterfactual reasoning in causal inference.

Abstract: To reach human level intelligence, learning algorithms need to incorporate
causal reasoning. But identifying causality, and particularly counterfactual
reasoning, remains an elusive task. In this paper, we make progress on this
task by utilizing instrumental variables (IVs). IVs are a classic tool for
mitigating bias from unobserved confounders when estimating causal effects.
While IV methods have been extended to non-separable structural models at the
population level, existing approaches to counterfactual prediction typically
assume additive noise in the outcome. In this paper, we show that under
standard IV assumptions, along with the assumptions that latent noises in
treatment and outcome are strictly monotonic and jointly Gaussian, the
treatment-outcome relationship becomes uniquely identifiable from observed
data. This enables counterfactual inference even in nonseparable models. We
implement our approach by training a normalizing flow to maximize the
likelihood of the observed data, demonstrating accurate recovery of the
underlying outcome function. We call our method Flow IV.

### [668] [Debiasing Machine Learning Predictions for Causal Inference Without Additional Ground Truth Data: "One Map, Many Trials" in Satellite-Driven Poverty Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01341)
*Markus Pettersson,Connor T. Jerzak,Adel Daoud*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper introduces two debiasing methods (linear calibration and Tweedie's correction) to reduce prediction bias in wealth maps derived from satellite imagery, improving causal inference without needing new labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ML models for wealth prediction suffer from shrinkage bias, limiting their policy utility. Existing debiasing methods require fresh data, which is impractical in data-scarce settings.

Method: Two correction methods are proposed: linear calibration (using held-out data for linear transformation) and Tweedie's correction (empirical Bayes approach leveraging model score functions).

Result: The methods outperform or match existing approaches that require pipeline adjustments or extra labeled data, as shown in experiments with Demographic and Health Survey data.

Conclusion: These methods enhance causal inference reliability without new data, supporting a 'one map, many trials' paradigm for broader ML pipeline usability.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite
imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level
wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can
be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training
objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently
suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of
causal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing
debiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this
attenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the
downstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in
data-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction
methods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that
substantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled
data. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear
transformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's
correction leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address
shrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's
learning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using
Demographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods
meet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to
training pipelines or (b) additional labeled data. These approaches may
represent a promising avenue for improving the reliability of causal inference
when direct outcome measures are limited or unavailable, enabling a "one map,
many trials" paradigm where a single upstream data creation team produces
predictions usable by many downstream teams across diverse ML pipelines.

*Hwanwoo Kim,Simon Mak,Ann-Kathrin Schuetz,Alan Poon*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Proposes BOMM, a new black-box optimization method using marginal mean functions to improve performance in high-dimensional spaces, outperforming traditional 'pick-the-winner' approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box optimization methods perform poorly in high-dimensional spaces due to reliance on evaluated inputs, leading to suboptimal solutions.

Method: BOMM leverages marginal mean functions to estimate a global optimizer, enabling selection of solutions beyond evaluated inputs. It uses a transformed additive Gaussian process surrogate model.

Result: BOMM is proven consistent for optimization and mitigates the 'curse-of-dimensionality,' showing better performance as dimensionality increases.

Conclusion: BOMM outperforms existing methods in numerical experiments and real-world applications like neutrino detector optimization.

Abstract: With advances in scientific computing, computer experiments are increasingly
used for optimizing complex systems. However, for modern applications, e.g.,
the optimization of nuclear physics detectors, each experiment run can require
hundreds of CPU hours, making the optimization of its black-box simulator over
a high-dimensional space a challenging task. Given limited runs at inputs
$\mathbf{x}_1, \cdots, \mathbf{x}_n$, the best solution from these evaluated
inputs can be far from optimal, particularly as dimensionality increases.
Existing black-box methods, however, largely employ this ''pick-the-winner''
(PW) solution, which leads to mediocre optimization performance. To address
this, we propose a new Black-box Optimization via Marginal Means (BOMM)
approach. The key idea is a new estimator of a global optimizer $\mathbf{x}^*$
that leverages the so-called marginal mean functions, which can be efficiently
inferred with limited runs in high dimensions. Unlike PW, this estimator can
select solutions beyond evaluated inputs for improved optimization performance.
Assuming the objective function follows a generalized additive model with
unknown link function and under mild conditions, we prove that the BOMM
estimator not only is consistent for optimization, but also has an optimization
rate that tempers the ''curse-of-dimensionality'' faced by existing methods,
thus enabling better performance as dimensionality increases. We present a
practical framework for implementing BOMM using the transformed additive
Gaussian process surrogate model. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
BOMM in numerical experiments and an application on neutrino detector
optimization in nuclear physics.

Motivation: To address the need for efficient Gaussian process inference, especially for low-dimensional problems with large datasets.

Method: Uses exact kernel decomposition into weighted empirical cumulative distribution functions and a divide-and-conquer approach with stored sorting outputs.

Result: Numerical experiments show effectiveness for low-dimensional problems with hundreds of thousands of data points.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm is efficient and practical, with an available implementation.

Abstract: To speed up Gaussian process inference, a number of fast kernel matrix-vector
multiplication (MVM) approximation algorithms have been proposed over the
years. In this paper, we establish an exact fast kernel MVM algorithm based on
exact kernel decomposition into weighted empirical cumulative distribution
functions, compatible with a class of kernels which includes multivariate
Mat\'ern kernels with half-integer smoothness parameter. This algorithm uses a
divide-and-conquer approach, during which sorting outputs are stored in a data
structure. We also propose a new algorithm to take into account some linear
fixed effects predictor function. Our numerical experiments confirm that our
algorithm is very effective for low-dimensional Gaussian process inference
problems with hundreds of thousands of data points. An implementation of our
algorithm is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Structure Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm to improve individual treatment effect estimation by balancing representation learning and adversarial networks with a structure keeper.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shift from average to individual treatment effect estimation in causal inference, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy.

Method: Proposes SMRL with a structure keeper to maintain covariate-representation correlation and a discriminator to balance representation and minimize information loss.

Result: SMRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments with simulated and real-world data, including MIMIC-III EHR data.

Conclusion: The SMRL algorithm effectively balances distribution and information loss, improving individual treatment effect estimation.

Abstract: Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest
from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment
effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation
learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by
introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the
baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high
dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers
to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the
proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation
error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information
loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space
and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with
simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure
Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic
health record data from the MIMIC-III database.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative models necessitates new evaluation methods, particularly in large-scale, high-dimensional regimes where standard statistical techniques fall short.

Method: The study compares the New Physics Learning Machine (a classification-based two-sample test) to alternative approaches, following the framework of Grossi et al. (2025).

Result: The work highlights efficiency tradeoffs and computational costs of learning-based approaches, such as the New Physics Learning Machine.

Conclusion: The paper discusses the advantages of different methods for various use cases, providing insights into their practical applications.

Abstract: The rise of generative models for scientific research calls for the
development of new methods to evaluate their fidelity. A natural framework for
addressing this problem is two-sample hypothesis testing, namely the task of
determining whether two data sets are drawn from the same distribution. In
large-scale and high-dimensional regimes, machine learning offers a set of
tools to push beyond the limitations of standard statistical techniques. In
this work, we put this claim to the test by comparing a recent proposal from
the high-energy physics literature, the New Physics Learning Machine, to
perform a classification-based two-sample test against a number of alternative
approaches, following the framework presented in Grossi et al. (2025). We
highlight the efficiency tradeoffs of the method and the computational costs
that come from adopting learning-based approaches. Finally, we discuss the
advantages of the different methods for different use cases.

Motivation: Generative AI models can produce biased or overconfident results in inverse problems, necessitating a rigorous solution for trustworthy inference.

Method: FreB reshapes AI-generated probability distributions into valid confidence regions, ensuring coverage and minimal size when data aligns.

Result: FreB successfully addresses challenges like dataset shift, model reconciliation, and bias mitigation in physical sciences.

Conclusion: FreB provides validity guarantees and interpretable diagnostics, enabling reliable inference in fields with intractable likelihoods.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) excels at producing complex data
structures (text, images, videos) by learning patterns from training examples.
Across scientific disciplines, researchers are now applying generative models
to ``inverse problems'' to infer hidden parameters from observed data. While
these methods can handle intractable models and large-scale studies, they can
also produce biased or overconfident conclusions. We present a solution with
Frequentist-Bayes (FreB), a mathematically rigorous protocol that reshapes
AI-generated probability distributions into confidence regions that
consistently include true parameters with the expected probability, while
achieving minimum size when training and target data align. We demonstrate
FreB's effectiveness by tackling diverse case studies in the physical sciences:
identifying unknown sources under dataset shift, reconciling competing
theoretical models, and mitigating selection bias and systematics in
observational studies. By providing validity guarantees with interpretable
diagnostics, FreB enables trustworthy scientific inference across fields where
direct likelihood evaluation remains impossible or prohibitively expensive.

TL;DR: Cyber-Zero is a runtime-free framework for training cybersecurity LLMs using synthesized agent trajectories from CTF writeups, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Runtime environments for training LLMs are often unavailable in cybersecurity, limiting their applicability.

Method: Cyber-Zero uses persona-driven LLM simulation to reverse-engineer runtime behaviors from CTF writeups, generating realistic interaction sequences without actual environments.

Result: Cyber-Zero-trained models achieve up to 13.1% performance gains on CTF benchmarks, matching proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324.

Conclusion: Runtime-free trajectory synthesis democratizes development of high-performance cybersecurity agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

### [675] [AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249)
*Peiran Wang,Yang Liu,Yunfei Lu,Yifeng Cai,Hongbo Chen,Qingyou Yang,Jie Zhang,Jue Hong,Ye Wu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AgentArmor is a framework that analyzes LLM agent runtime traces as structured programs to detect security risks like prompt injection attacks, achieving high accuracy in detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dynamic and non-transparent behavior of LLM agents introduces security risks, especially prompt injection attacks, necessitating a structured approach to analyze and mitigate these risks.

Method: AgentArmor converts agent traces into graph-based intermediate representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system with components like a graph constructor, property registry, and type system.

Result: AgentArmor achieves 95.75% true positive rate (TPR) and only 3.66% false positive rate (FPR) on the AgentDojo benchmark, effectively detecting vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: AgentArmor successfully enables program analysis over agent behavior, detecting prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforcing fine-grained security constraints.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

### [676] [ConfGuard: A Simple and Effective Backdoor Detection for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01365)
*Zihan Wang,Rui Zhang,Hongwei Li,Wenshu Fan,Wenbo Jiang,Qingchuan Zhao,Guowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ConfGuard is a lightweight method to detect backdoor attacks in LLMs by identifying abnormal confidence patterns (sequence lock) in token generation, achieving high accuracy with minimal latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses for LLMs are ineffective due to their autoregressive nature and vast output space, leading to poor performance and high latency.

Method: ConfGuard monitors token confidences in a sliding window to detect sequence lock, where backdoored models show abnormally high and consistent confidence in target sequences.

Result: ConfGuard achieves near 100% true positive rate and negligible false positive rate, with almost no additional latency.

Conclusion: ConfGuard is a practical and effective real-time defense for backdoor attacks in LLMs.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs),
where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most
existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are
ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs,
thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these
limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and
backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we
term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with
abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation.
Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective
detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to
identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a
near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR)
in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time
detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor
defense for real-world LLM deployments.

### [677] [DUP: Detection-guided Unlearning for Backdoor Purification in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01647)
*Man Hu,Yahui Ding,Yatao Yang,Liangyu Chen,Yanhao Jia,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DUP is a unified framework for detecting and purifying backdoor attacks by combining fine-grained detection with parameter-efficient unlearning, avoiding full retraining or external clean models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses against backdoor attacks are limited by coarse-grained detection and reliance on retraining or clean models.

Method: DUP integrates feature-level anomaly detection (using class-agnostic distances and inter-layer transitions) with knowledge distillation-based unlearning to purify models.

Result: DUP outperforms existing methods in detection accuracy and purification efficacy across diverse attacks and model architectures.

Conclusion: DUP provides an effective, efficient solution for defending against stealthy backdoor attacks without full retraining or clean models.

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PDFuzz is a novel attack that manipulates PDF text layout to evade AI-generated text detectors, reducing their performance to random levels while maintaining visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated text detectors lack robustness against evasion attacks, particularly those exploiting PDF document structures.

Method: PDFuzz exploits discrepancies between visual text layout and extraction order in PDFs, preserving content while scrambling extraction sequences.

Result: The attack reduces detector accuracy from 93.6% to 50.4% and F1 score from 0.938 to 0.0, achieving complete evasion.

Conclusion: PDFuzz exposes a vulnerability in current detectors, highlighting the need for stronger safeguards against such attacks.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining
content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains
questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy
between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method
preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to
scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT
detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results
demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4)
% accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4
$\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity.
Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent
to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy
safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at
https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz.

### [679] [Measuring Harmfulness of Computer-Using Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00935)
*Aaron Xuxiang Tian,Ruofan Zhang,Janet Tang,Jiaxin Wen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CUAHarm benchmark evaluates misuse risks of computer-using agents (CUAs) with expert-written tasks, revealing high compliance rates in frontier LMs without jailbreaking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack full computer access for evaluating CUAs' misuse risks, necessitating a new benchmark like CUAHarm.

Method: CUAHarm includes 104 expert-written misuse tasks, a sandbox environment, and verifiable rewards to measure success rates of CUAs.

Result: Frontier LMs show high misuse rates (e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet), with newer models being riskier. Agentic frameworks amplify risks.

Conclusion: CUAHarm highlights significant misuse risks in CUAs, with limited mitigation success via monitoring, and calls for better safety measures.

Abstract: Computer-using agents (CUAs), which autonomously control computers to perform
multi-step actions, might pose significant safety risks if misused. Existing
benchmarks mostly evaluate language models' (LMs) safety risks in chatbots or
simple tool-usage scenarios, without granting full computer access. To better
evaluate CUAs' misuse risks, we introduce a new benchmark: CUAHarm. CUAHarm
consists of 104 expert-written realistic misuse risks, such as disabling
firewalls, leaking confidential information, launching denial-of-service
attacks, or installing backdoors. We provide a sandbox environment and
rule-based verifiable rewards to measure CUAs' success rates in executing these
tasks (e.g., whether the firewall is indeed disabled), not just refusal. We
evaluate multiple frontier open-source and proprietary LMs, such as Claude
Sonnet, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama-3.3-70B, and Mistral Large 2.
Surprisingly, even without carefully designed jailbreaking prompts, these
frontier LMs comply with executing these malicious tasks at a high success rate
(e.g., 59% for Claude 3.7 Sonnet). Newer models show higher misuse rates:
Claude 3.7 Sonnet succeeds on 15% more tasks than Claude 3.5. While these
models are robust to common malicious prompts (e.g., creating a bomb) in
chatbot settings, they behave unsafely as CUAs. We further evaluate a leading
agentic framework (UI-TARS-1.5) and find that while it improves performance, it
also amplifies misuse risks. Benign variants reveal refusals stem from
alignment, not capability limits. To mitigate risks, we explore using LMs to
monitor CUAs' actions and chain-of-thoughts (CoTs). Monitoring CUAs is
significantly harder than chatbot outputs. Monitoring CoTs yields modest gains,
with average detection accuracy at only 72%. Even with hierarchical
summarization, improvement is limited to 4%. CUAHarm will be released at
https://github.com/db-ol/CUAHarm.

### [680] [A Decentralized Framework for Ethical Authorship Validation in Academic Publishing: Leveraging Self-Sovereign Identity and Blockchain Technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01913)
*Kamal Al-Sabahi,Yousuf Khamis Al Mabsali*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A decentralized framework using SSI and blockchain is proposed to address unethical practices in academic publishing by ensuring authorship consent, accurate attribution, and conflict-of-interest detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing systems like ORCID fail to enforce authorship consent, verify roles, or detect conflicts of interest, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The framework employs DIDs, VCs, blockchain, and ZKPs to verify identities, record consent immutably, and detect conflicts privately.

Result: Stakeholder surveys indicate improved ethical compliance and trust in scholarly communication.

Conclusion: The framework advances transparency and accountability in academic publishing.

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific
advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as
unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed
conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively
disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit
authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly
detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these
shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model
uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to
securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and
ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records
authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving
cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support
conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified
authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,
increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and
reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in
scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent,
accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

### [681] [LLMs Can Covertly Sandbag on Capability Evaluations Against Chain-of-Thought Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00943)
*Chloe Li,Mary Phuong,Noah Y. Siegel*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper examines AI models' ability to sandbag (strategically underperform) on dangerous capability evaluations, testing their evasion of chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring. Both frontier and small models can sandbag covertly but unreliably, with a 16-36% success rate when monitor-aware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the reliability of CoT monitoring in detecting sandbagging, a critical threat to AI safety evaluations.

Method: Models were prompted to sandbag while being monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware, and their success in bypassing CoT monitoring was measured.

Result: Models could sandbag covertly 0-shot but unreliably (16-36% success when monitor-aware). Uncaught CoTs were analyzed to understand monitor failures.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in CoT monitoring, revealing an attack surface and contributing sandbagging policies to improve future defenses.

Abstract: Trustworthy evaluations of dangerous capabilities are increasingly crucial
for determining whether an AI system is safe to deploy. One empirically
demonstrated threat to this is sandbagging - the strategic underperformance on
evaluations by AI models or their developers. One promising defense is to
monitor a model's chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, as this could reveal its
intentions and plans. In this work, we measure the ability of models to sandbag
on dangerous capability evaluations against a CoT monitor by prompting them to
sandbag while being either monitor-oblivious or monitor-aware. We show that
both frontier models and small open-sourced models can covertly sandbag against
CoT monitoring 0-shot without hints. However, they cannot yet do so reliably:
they bypass the monitor 16-36\% of the time when monitor-aware, conditioned on
sandbagging successfully. We qualitatively analyzed the uncaught CoTs to
understand why the monitor failed. We reveal a rich attack surface for CoT
monitoring and contribute five covert sandbagging policies generated by models.
These results inform potential failure modes of CoT monitoring and may help
build more diverse sandbagging model organisms.

*Isabelle Bakker,John Hastings*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GPT-4o autonomously solved 80% of beginner-level offensive security tasks in OverTheWire's Bandit game, excelling in single-step challenges but struggling with multi-command scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess GPT-4o's capability in automating novice penetration-testing tasks and identify its limitations in offensive cybersecurity.

Method: Connected GPT-4o to OverTheWire's Bandit game, testing its ability to solve 25 levels via SSH commands.

Result: GPT-4o solved 18 levels unaided and 2 with hints (80% success), excelling in simple tasks but failing in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: LLMs like GPT-4o can automate novice penetration-testing, lowering expertise barriers, but their limitations highlight areas for secure-by-design hardening and educational integration.

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of GPT-4o to autonomously solve
beginner-level offensive security tasks by connecting the model to
OverTheWire's Bandit capture-the-flag game. Of the 25 levels that were
technically compatible with a single-command SSH framework, GPT-4o solved 18
unaided and another two after minimal prompt hints for an overall 80% success
rate. The model excelled at single-step challenges that involved Linux
filesystem navigation, data extraction or decoding, and straightforward
networking. The approach often produced the correct command in one shot and at
a human-surpassing speed. Failures involved multi-command scenarios that
required persistent working directories, complex network reconnaissance, daemon
creation, or interaction with non-standard shells. These limitations highlight
current architectural deficiencies rather than a lack of general exploit
knowledge. The results demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can
automate a substantial portion of novice penetration-testing workflow,
potentially lowering the expertise barrier for attackers and offering
productivity gains for defenders who use LLMs as rapid reconnaissance aides.
Further, the unsolved tasks reveal specific areas where secure-by-design
environments might frustrate simple LLM-driven attacks, informing future
hardening strategies. Beyond offensive cybersecurity applications, results
suggest the potential to integrate LLMs into cybersecurity education as
practice aids.

Motivation: To address the limited integration of LLMs in cybersecurity due to data, complexity, and safety concerns, the authors developed a specialized model for dialogue and instruction-following.

Method: Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, the model combines domain-specific knowledge, conversational capabilities, and human preference alignment.

Result: Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct in cybersecurity tasks and matches GPT-4o-mini in threat intelligence and instruction-following.

Conclusion: The model is envisioned as a valuable tool for cybersecurity professionals and is publicly released.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success across many
domains, yet their integration into cybersecurity applications remains limited
due to a lack of general-purpose cybersecurity data, representational
complexity, and safety and regulatory concerns. To address this gap, we
previously introduced Foundation-Sec-8B, a cybersecurity-focused LLM suitable
for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. That model, however, was not designed for
chat-style interactions or instruction-following. In this report, we release
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct: a model specifically trained for general-purpose
cybersecurity dialogue. Built on Foundation-Sec-8B, it combines domain-specific
knowledge with instruction-following, conversational capabilities, and
alignment with human preferences to produce high-quality, relevant responses.
Comprehensive evaluations show that Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct outperforms
Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct on a range of cybersecurity tasks while matching its
instruction-following performance. It is also competitive with GPT-4o-mini on
cyber threat intelligence and instruction-following tasks. We envision
Foundation-Sec-8B-Instruct becoming an indispensable assistant in the daily
workflows of cybersecurity professionals. We release the model publicly at

TL;DR: This paper proposes SAG, a provably secure framework for RAG systems, addressing privacy and security risks like data leakage and poisoning through full-encryption and formal security guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems lack systematic solutions for privacy and security risks, relying on heuristic methods with limited interpretability and security guarantees.

Method: The SAG framework uses a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to protect retrieved content and vector embeddings, ensuring only authorized access. Formal security proofs validate confidentiality and integrity.

Result: Experiments show SAG resists state-of-the-art attacks, providing verifiable security for RAG systems.

Conclusion: SAG establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for secure RAG systems, advancing AI services with formal security guarantees.

Abstract: Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have been widely
applied, the privacy and security risks they face, such as data leakage and
data poisoning, have not been systematically addressed yet. Existing defense
strategies primarily rely on heuristic filtering or enhancing retriever
robustness, which suffer from limited interpretability, lack of formal security
guarantees, and vulnerability to adaptive attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the first provably secure framework for RAG systems(SAG).
Our framework employs a pre-storage full-encryption scheme to ensure dual
protection of both retrieved content and vector embeddings, guaranteeing that
only authorized entities can access the data. Through formal security proofs,
we rigorously verify the scheme's confidentiality and integrity under a
computational security model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively resists a range of
state-of-the-art attacks. This work establishes a theoretical foundation and
practical paradigm for verifiably secure RAG systems, advancing AI-powered
services toward formally guaranteed security.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes four defense strategies (KPB, NCC, CBD, MDT) against Beta Poisoning attacks, demonstrating their effectiveness on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, with KPB and MDT achieving perfect accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Beta Poisoning attacks disrupt ML model accuracy by making training data linearly nonseparable, posing a significant security threat.

Method: Four defense strategies are developed based on observed characteristics of poisoning samples, such as proximity and centrality near the target class mean.

Result: KPB and MDT achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores; CBD and NCC also show strong defensive performance.

Conclusion: The defenses are effective against Beta Poisoning, with practical insights provided for varying conditions.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks, in which an attacker adversarially manipulates the
training dataset of a machine learning (ML) model, pose a significant threat to
ML security. Beta Poisoning is a recently proposed poisoning attack that
disrupts model accuracy by making the training dataset linearly nonseparable.
In this paper, we propose four defense strategies against Beta Poisoning
attacks: kNN Proximity-Based Defense (KPB), Neighborhood Class Comparison
(NCC), Clustering-Based Defense (CBD), and Mean Distance Threshold (MDT). The
defenses are based on our observations regarding the characteristics of
poisoning samples generated by Beta Poisoning, e.g., poisoning samples have
close proximity to one another, and they are centered near the mean of the
target class. Experimental evaluations using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets
demonstrate that KPB and MDT can achieve perfect accuracy and F1 scores, while
CBD and NCC also provide strong defensive capabilities. Furthermore, by
analyzing performance across varying parameters, we offer practical insights
regarding defenses' behaviors under varying conditions.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper addresses security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes) and proposes BlockA2A, a unified trust framework, along with a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) to mitigate risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of agentic AI introduces security risks like fragmented identity frameworks and insecure communication, which legacy strategies fail to address.

Method: BlockA2A uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs), blockchain, and smart contracts for secure agent interoperability. DOE provides real-time attack neutralization.

Result: Empirical evaluations show BlockA2A effectively counters various MAS attacks with sub-second overhead.

Conclusion: BlockA2A and DOE offer scalable, secure solutions for LLM-based MAS environments, demonstrated via integration with Google's A2A protocol.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is
transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex
workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven
multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure
communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or
adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of
these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies
cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the
first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable
and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts
decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent
authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,
and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control
policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message
authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across
agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine
(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including
Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission
revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in
neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS
attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a
practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that
BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment
in production LLM-based MAS environments.

TL;DR: UEChecker, a deep learning tool using Graph Convolutional Networks, detects unchecked external call vulnerabilities in DApps with 87.59% accuracy, outperforming baselines like GAT, LSTM, and GCN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Economic losses from contract layer attacks in DApps ($66 billion) due to unchecked external calls motivate the need for vulnerability detection tools.

Method: UEChecker combines call graphs with Graph Convolutional Networks, featuring edge prediction, node aggregation, and Conformer Block modules to enhance vulnerability detection.

Result: Achieves 87.59% accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities, outperforming GAT, LSTM, and GCN baselines.

Conclusion: UEChecker effectively detects unchecked external call vulnerabilities, offering a robust solution for securing DApps.

Abstract: The increasing number of attacks on the contract layer of DApps has resulted
in economic losses amounting to $66 billion. Vulnerabilities arise when
contracts interact with external protocols without verifying the results of the
calls, leading to exploit entry points such as flash loan attacks and
reentrancy attacks. In this paper, we propose UEChecker, a deep learning-based
tool that utilizes a call graph and a Graph Convolutional Network to detect
unchecked external call vulnerabilities. We design the following components: An
edge prediction module that reconstructs the feature representation of nodes
and edges in the call graph; A node aggregation module that captures structural
information from both the node itself and its neighbors, thereby enhancing
feature representation between nodes and improving the model's understanding of
the global graph structure; A Conformer Block module that integrates multi-head
attention, convolutional modules, and feedforward neural networks to more
effectively capture dependencies of different scales within the call graph,
extending beyond immediate neighbors and enhancing the performance of
vulnerability detection. Finally, we combine these modules with Graph
Convolutional Network to detect unchecked external call vulnerabilities. By
auditing the smart contracts of 608 DApps, our results show that our tool
achieves an accuracy of 87.59% in detecting unchecked external call
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we compare our tool with GAT, LSTM, and GCN
baselines, and in the comparison experiments, UEChecker consistently
outperforms these models in terms of accuracy.

Claude Opus 4, DeepSeek, and Qwen3 Plus) on both synthetic benchmarks and
real-world smart contracts affected by known high-impact exploits. Our results
show that modern LLMs can reliably generate functional PoC exploits for diverse
vulnerability types, with success rates reaching up to 92\%. Notably, Gemini
2.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in both synthetic and

including model capabilities, contract structure, and vulnerability types. We
also collect the first curated dataset of real-world PoC exploits to support
future research.

TL;DR: The paper addresses reconstructing high-dimensional trust embeddings from one-dimensional Siamese trust scores, proving a unique fixed-point solution and demonstrating privacy risks with practical countermeasures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the inverse problem of reconstructing trust embeddings from exposed trust scores, highlighting privacy risks in distributed-security frameworks.

Method: Formalizes the estimation task, derives a direct-sum estimator with moment features, and proves a unique fixed-point solution using Banach theory. Validated with synthetic benchmarks and non-asymptotic error bounds.

Result: Recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry under noise, with accuracy linked to score-sequence length. Reveals privacy risks from granular trust scores.

Conclusion: Proposes countermeasures (quantisation, noise, obfuscation) and discusses transparency vs. confidentiality in AI systems. Provides open datasets and scripts for verification.

Abstract: We study the inverse problem of reconstructing high-dimensional trust
embeddings from the one-dimensional Siamese trust scores that many
distributed-security frameworks expose. Starting from two independent agents
that publish time-stamped similarity scores for the same set of devices, we
formalise the estimation task, derive an explicit direct-sum estimator that
concatenates paired score series with four moment features, and prove that the
resulting reconstruction map admits a unique fixed point under a contraction
argument rooted in Banach theory. A suite of synthetic benchmarks (20 devices x
10 time steps) confirms that, even in the presence of Gaussian noise, the
recovered embeddings preserve inter-device geometry as measured by Euclidean
and cosine metrics; we complement these experiments with non-asymptotic error
bounds that link reconstruction accuracy to score-sequence length. Beyond
methodology, the paper demonstrates a practical privacy risk: publishing
granular trust scores can leak latent behavioural information about both
devices and evaluation models. We therefore discuss counter-measures -- score
quantisation, calibrated noise, obfuscated embedding spaces -- and situate them
within wider debates on transparency versus confidentiality in networked AI
systems. All datasets, reproduction scripts and extended proofs accompany the
submission so that results can be verified without proprietary code.

*Dulana Rupanetti,Naima Kaabouch*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper explores machine learning techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) to enhance security in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments, focusing on botnet attack detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of IoT devices and Edge Computing has introduced security vulnerabilities, especially botnet attacks, necessitating advanced detection methods.

Method: Comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM using an IoT network traffic dataset to detect and classify botnet activities.

Result: The models demonstrated high accuracy in detecting botnet threats, with potential for deployment in resource-constrained IoT and edge devices.

Conclusion: Machine learning can effectively strengthen IoT networks against cybersecurity threats, with practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The increase of IoT devices, driven by advancements in hardware technologies,
has led to widespread deployment in large-scale networks that process massive
amounts of data daily. However, the reliance on Edge Computing to manage these
devices has introduced significant security vulnerabilities, as attackers can
compromise entire networks by targeting a single IoT device. In light of
escalating cybersecurity threats, particularly botnet attacks, this paper
investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance security
in Edge-Computing-Assisted IoT environments. Specifically, it presents a
comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM -- three advanced
ensemble learning algorithms -- to address the dynamic and complex nature of
botnet threats. Utilizing a widely recognized IoT network traffic dataset
comprising benign and malicious instances, the models were trained, tested, and
evaluated for their accuracy in detecting and classifying botnet activities.
Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of deploying these models in
resource-constrained edge and IoT devices, demonstrating their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. The results highlight the potential of
machine learning to fortify IoT networks against emerging cybersecurity
challenges.

*Dong Chen,Tong Yang,Feipeng Zhai,Pengpeng Ouyang,Qidong Liu,Yafei Li,Chong Fu,Mingliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Semantic Encryption (SE) is a plug-and-play framework for secure Cloud-based Large Language Model (CLLM) interactions, preserving privacy and utility by transforming user inputs semantically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing privacy concerns in CLLM interactions without compromising data utility or performance.

Method: SE uses Semantic Encoding (transforming inputs to obfuscate sensitive data) and Semantic Decoding (reconstructing responses).

Result: SE outperforms InferDPT, maintaining privacy and utility across metrics and datasets.

Conclusion: SE offers a practical, effective solution for secure CLLM interactions.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of Cloud-based Large Language Models (CLLMs) has
raised significant concerns regarding data privacy during user interactions.
While existing approaches primarily focus on encrypting sensitive information,
they often overlook the logical structure of user inputs. This oversight can
lead to reduced data utility and degraded performance of CLLMs. To address
these limitations and enable secure yet effective interactions, we propose
Semantic Encryption (SE)-a plug-and-play framework designed to preserve both
privacy and utility. SE consists of two key components: Semantic Encoding and
Semantic Decoding. In the encoding phase, a lightweight local model transforms
the original user input into an alternative semantic context that maintains the
original intent and logical structure while obfuscating sensitive information.
This transformed input is then processed by the CLLM, which generates a
response based on the transformed semantic context. To maintain a seamless user
experience, the decoding phase will reconstruct the CLLM's response back into
the original semantic context by referencing the locally stored user input.
Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that SE effectively protects
data privacy without compromising data utility or user experience, offering a
practical solution for secure interaction with CLLMs. Particularly, the
proposed SE demonstrates a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
InferDPT, surpassing it across various evaluated metrics and datasets.

*Chenyi Wang,Ruoyu Song,Raymond Muller,Jean-Philippe Monteuuis,Z. Berkay Celik,Jonathan Petit,Ryan Gerdes,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CP-FREEZER is a latency attack on cooperative perception (CP) systems, exploiting V2V messages to maximize computation delay, revealing critical vulnerabilities in CP timeliness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on adversarial integrity attacks, but CP's robustness against timeliness attacks, crucial for autonomous driving safety, remained unexplored.

Method: CP-FREEZER injects adversarial perturbations via V2V messages, overcoming challenges like non-differentiable preprocessing and asynchronous victim input knowledge, using a novel loss function to maximize CP pipeline delay.

Result: The attack increases CP latency by over 90x, exceeding 3 seconds per frame with 100% success rate in real-world tests.

Conclusion: CP-FREEZER exposes a severe threat to CP availability, underscoring the need for robust defenses against such attacks.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

*Xin He,Junxi Shen,Zhenheng Tang,Xiaowen Chu,Bo Li,Ivor W. Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RouteMark is a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models using expert routing fingerprints, ensuring attribution and tampering detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of attributing and protecting the intellectual property of individual experts in merged MoE models is underexplored.

Method: RouteMark uses expert-level fingerprints (RSF and RPF) and a similarity-based matching algorithm for attribution and tampering detection.

Result: RouteMark achieves high similarity for reused experts and robustness against structural and parametric tampering.

Conclusion: RouteMark is a practical framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

Abstract: Model merging via Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a scalable solution
for consolidating multiple task-specific models into a unified sparse
architecture, where each expert is derived from a model fine-tuned on a
distinct task. While effective for multi-task integration, this paradigm
introduces a critical yet underexplored challenge: how to attribute and protect
the intellectual property (IP) of individual experts after merging. We propose
RouteMark, a framework for IP protection in merged MoE models through the
design of expert routing fingerprints. Our key insight is that task-specific
experts exhibit stable and distinctive routing behaviors under probing inputs.
To capture these patterns, we construct expert-level fingerprints using two
complementary statistics: the Routing Score Fingerprint (RSF), quantifying the
intensity of expert activation, and the Routing Preference Fingerprint (RPF),
characterizing the input distribution that preferentially activates each
expert. These fingerprints are reproducible, task-discriminative, and
lightweight to construct. For attribution and tampering detection, we introduce
a similarity-based matching algorithm that compares expert fingerprints between
a suspect and a reference (victim) model. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and CLIP-based MoE architectures show that RouteMark consistently yields
high similarity for reused experts and clear separation from unrelated ones.
Moreover, it remains robust against both structural tampering (expert
replacement, addition, deletion) and parametric tampering (fine-tuning,
pruning, permutation), outperforming weight- and activation-based baseliness.
Our work lays the foundation for RouteMark as a practical and broadly
applicable framework for IP verification in MoE-based model merging.

TL;DR: The study analyzes Android app permissions, revealing trends in benign and malicious apps, and uses FP-Growth to uncover frequent permission combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand permission abuse and evolving developer strategies in Android apps, distinguishing between benign and malicious usage.

Method: Comprehensive analysis of permission requests, association rule mining (FP-Growth algorithm), and categorization into semantic groups.

Result: Malicious apps request fewer permissions to evade detection, while benign apps request more. Significant differences in permission patterns across app genres and years.

Conclusion: Continuous monitoring, user education, and regulatory oversight are crucial to address permission misuse effectively.

Abstract: The proper use of Android app permissions is crucial to the success and
security of these apps. Users must agree to permission requests when installing
or running their apps. Despite official Android platform documentation on
proper permission usage, there are still many cases of permission abuse. This
study provides a comprehensive analysis of the Android permission landscape,
highlighting trends and patterns in permission requests across various
applications from the Google Play Store. By distinguishing between benign and
malicious applications, we uncover developers' evolving strategies, with
malicious apps increasingly requesting fewer permissions to evade detection,
while benign apps request more to enhance functionality. In addition to
examining permission trends across years and app features such as
advertisements, in-app purchases, content ratings, and app sizes, we leverage
association rule mining using the FP-Growth algorithm. This allows us to
uncover frequent permission combinations across the entire dataset, specific
years, and 16 app genres. The analysis reveals significant differences in
permission usage patterns, providing a deeper understanding of co-occurring
permissions and their implications for user privacy and app functionality. By
categorizing permissions into high-level semantic groups and examining their
application across distinct app categories, this study offers a structured
approach to analyzing the dynamics within the Android ecosystem. The findings
emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring, user education, and
regulatory oversight to address permission misuse effectively.

TL;DR: The paper proposes the Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF) to protect digital identity from AI threats like cloning and impersonation, through legal, technical, and hybrid controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI threatens personal identity integrity, necessitating robust protections against digital cloning, impersonation, and unauthorized data use.

Method: Introduces DIRF, a structured model with nine domains and 63 controls, combining legal, technical, and hybrid enforcement mechanisms.

Result: DIRF provides a unified framework for securing digital identity consent, traceability, and monetization.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for DIRF to guide platform builders, legal entities, and regulators in enforcing identity rights in AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative artificial
intelligence (AI) pose significant threats to the integrity of personal
identity, including digital cloning, sophisticated impersonation, and the
unauthorized monetization of identity-related data. Mitigating these risks
necessitates the development of robust AI-generated content detection systems,
enhanced legal frameworks, and ethical guidelines. This paper introduces the
Digital Identity Rights Framework (DIRF), a structured security and governance
model designed to protect behavioral, biometric, and personality-based digital
likeness attributes to address this critical need. Structured across nine
domains and 63 controls, DIRF integrates legal, technical, and hybrid
enforcement mechanisms to secure digital identity consent, traceability, and
monetization. We present the architectural foundations, enforcement strategies,
and key use cases supporting the need for a unified framework. This work aims
to inform platform builders, legal entities, and regulators about the essential
controls needed to enforce identity rights in AI-driven systems.

### [696] [FPEdit: Robust LLM Fingerprinting through Localized Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02092)
*Shida Wang,Chaohu Liu,Yubo Wang,Linli Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FPEdit is a knowledge-editing framework for embedding stealthy, natural language fingerprints in large language models, ensuring robust ownership verification without degrading performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are valuable but vulnerable to unauthorized use. Existing fingerprinting methods are either intrusive or detectable, necessitating a better solution.

Method: FPEdit modifies a sparse subset of model weights to inject semantically coherent fingerprints, ensuring minimal impact on functionality.

Result: FPEdit achieves 95-100% fingerprint retention under various adaptations, preserves performance on benchmarks, and reduces resource usage by 70%.

Conclusion: FPEdit offers a robust, stealthy, and efficient solution for verifying the provenance of large language models in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data,
and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual
assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized
redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box
deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based
techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered
by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel
knowledge-editing framework that injects semantically coherent natural language
fingerprints by modifying a sparse subset of model weights. This ensures
stealthy and precise ownership encoding without degrading the core
functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves $95$-$100\%$
fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and
parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on 24 downstream
benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and
stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under
10 minutes using less than 32 GB of GPU memory, a $70\%$ reduction in resource
requirements compared to existing techniques. These advances establish FPEdit
as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness
against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility,
providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of
large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

*Wenjie Li,Siying Gu,Yiming Li,Kangjie Chen,Zhili Chen,Tianwei Zhang,Shu-Tao Xia,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces Coward, a proactive defense method for detecting backdoor attacks in federated learning, addressing limitations of existing passive and proactive defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor detection methods in federated learning are either vulnerable to non-i.i.d. data distributions (passive) or suffer from OOD bias (proactive).

Method: Coward leverages multi-backdoor collision effects, injecting conflicting global watermarks to detect attackers based on their erasure during local training.

Result: Extensive experiments show Coward's effectiveness and resilience to adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: Coward offers a robust solution for backdoor detection in federated learning, mitigating OOD bias while handling data heterogeneity.

Abstract: Backdoor detection is currently the mainstream defense against backdoor
attacks in federated learning (FL), where malicious clients upload poisoned
updates that compromise the global model and undermine the reliability of FL
deployments. Existing backdoor detection techniques fall into two categories,
including passive and proactive ones, depending on whether the server
proactively modifies the global model. However, both have inherent limitations
in practice: passive defenses are vulnerable to common non-i.i.d. data
distributions and random participation of FL clients, whereas current proactive
defenses suffer inevitable out-of-distribution (OOD) bias because they rely on
backdoor co-existence effects. To address these issues, we introduce a new
proactive defense, dubbed Coward, inspired by our discovery of multi-backdoor
collision effects, in which consecutively planted, distinct backdoors
significantly suppress earlier ones. In general, we detect attackers by
evaluating whether the server-injected, conflicting global watermark is erased
during local training rather than retained. Our method preserves the advantages
of proactive defenses in handling data heterogeneity (\ie, non-i.i.d. data)
while mitigating the adverse impact of OOD bias through a revised detection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets confirm the
effectiveness of Coward and its resilience to potential adaptive attacks. The
code for our method would be available at

TL;DR: The paper surveys data security risks in Large Language Models (LLMs), reviews defense strategies, and suggests future research directions for secure LLM development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs rely on uncurated data, exposing them to security risks like toxic output and vulnerabilities, necessitating research to safeguard trust and reliability.

Method: The survey categorizes data security risks, reviews defense strategies (e.g., adversarial training, RLHF), and analyzes datasets for robustness assessment.

Result: Identified key risks and defenses, with guidance on datasets and future research directions like secure updates and governance frameworks.

Conclusion: The work aims to inform stakeholders and promote secure, responsible LLM development by addressing data-centric risks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), now a foundation in advancing natural language
processing, power applications such as text generation, machine translation,
and conversational systems. Despite their transformative potential, these
models inherently rely on massive amounts of training data, often collected
from diverse and uncurated sources, which exposes them to serious data security
risks. Harmful or malicious data can compromise model behavior, leading to
issues such as toxic output, hallucinations, and vulnerabilities to threats
such as prompt injection or data poisoning. As LLMs continue to be integrated
into critical real-world systems, understanding and addressing these
data-centric security risks is imperative to safeguard user trust and system
reliability. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of the main data
security risks facing LLMs and reviews current defense strategies, including
adversarial training, RLHF, and data augmentation. Additionally, we categorize
and analyze relevant datasets used for assessing robustness and security across
different domains, providing guidance for future research. Finally, we
highlight key research directions that focus on secure model updates,
explainability-driven defenses, and effective governance frameworks, aiming to
promote the safe and responsible development of LLM technology. This work aims
to inform researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, driving progress toward
data security in LLMs.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: ACT-Tensor is a novel framework for imputing missing multi-dimensional financial data, combining cluster-based completion and temporal smoothing to outperform benchmarks in accuracy and financial utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data in financial panels disrupts asset-pricing models and investment strategies, with existing methods failing due to flattened structures or overfitting.

Method: ACT-Tensor uses cluster-based completion for cross-sectional heterogeneity and temporal smoothing to preserve fundamental trends while removing noise.

Result: ACT-Tensor achieves higher imputation accuracy, reduces pricing errors, and improves risk-adjusted returns in portfolios.

Conclusion: ACT-Tensor provides accurate and valuable imputations, enhancing financial decision-making.

Abstract: Missing data in financial panels presents a critical obstacle, undermining
asset-pricing models and reducing the effectiveness of investment strategies.
Such panels are often inherently multi-dimensional, spanning firms, time, and
financial variables, which adds complexity to the imputation task. Conventional
imputation methods often fail by flattening the data's multidimensional
structure, struggling with heterogeneous missingness patterns, or overfitting
in the face of extreme data sparsity. To address these limitations, we
introduce an Adaptive, Cluster-based Temporal smoothing tensor completion
framework (ACT-Tensor) tailored for severely and heterogeneously missing
multi-dimensional financial data panels. ACT-Tensor incorporates two key
innovations: a cluster-based completion module that captures cross-sectional
heterogeneity by learning group-specific latent structures; and a temporal
smoothing module that proactively removes short-lived noise while preserving
slow-moving fundamental trends. Extensive experiments show that ACT-Tensor
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of imputation
accuracy across a range of missing data regimes, including extreme sparsity
scenarios. To assess its practical financial utility, we evaluate the imputed
data with an asset-pricing pipeline tailored for tensor-structured financial
data. Results show that ACT-Tensor not only reduces pricing errors but also
significantly improves risk-adjusted returns of the constructed portfolio.
These findings confirm that our method delivers highly accurate and informative
imputations, offering substantial value for financial decision-making.

TL;DR: A 3D perception pipeline for flower-harvesting robots is proposed, using synthetic data to train a deep learning model for rose center localization, achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The labor-intensive harvesting of medicinal plants like Damask roses limits scalability, prompting the need for automated solutions.

Method: A two-stage algorithm combines 2D point-based detection on stereo images with depth estimation via a lightweight deep neural network, trained on a photorealistic synthetic dataset.

Result: The method achieves an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4% (real) in 2D detection, with a 3% depth estimation error at 2 meters.

Conclusion: The pipeline bridges the synthetic-real data gap, offering a scalable solution for precision harvesting in agriculture.

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

TL;DR: HyCodePolicy introduces a hybrid control framework for embodied agents, combining code synthesis, grounding, monitoring, and repair to improve policy robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack adaptive mechanisms for monitoring and repairing code during task execution, limiting their effectiveness in embodied agents.

Method: HyCodePolicy decomposes instructions into subgoals, generates executable programs, monitors execution with a VLM, and repairs programs using dual feedback.

Result: The framework significantly enhances robot manipulation policies' robustness and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: HyCodePolicy offers a scalable solution for integrating multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework combining model-based and learning-based approaches for closed-loop pivoting manipulation, using CITO for efficient RL and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in non-prehensile manipulation by bridging model-based (sensitive to inaccuracies) and learning-based (data-hungry) methods.

Method: Demonstration-guided deep RL leveraging CITO for sample efficiency, with sim-to-real transfer using privileged training.

Result: Successful sim-to-real transfer for pivoting tasks using proprioception, vision, and force sensing.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enables robust, efficient manipulation without privileged information.

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

TL;DR: The paper introduces human-robot red teaming for safety-aware reasoning, enabling robots to identify hazards, assess risks, and operate safely in high-risk environments like lunar habitats and households.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the deficit in research on how robots perform tasks safely in high-risk domains and earning human trust for effective collaboration.

Method: Proposes human-robot red teaming, where humans and robots collaboratively challenge assumptions and explore hazards for safety-aware reasoning.

Result: Demonstrates successful safety planning in diverse domains and adaptability of robots to varying safety definitions in lunar habitats and households.

Conclusion: Human-robot red teaming is feasible for promoting trust and safe operation in safety-critical tasks.

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COLLAGE improves few-shot imitation learning by adaptively combining multiple data retrieval heuristics, outperforming prior methods by 5.1% in simulation and 16.6% in real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for data retrieval in few-shot imitation learning rely on single-feature distance heuristics, which can introduce irrelevant or detrimental demonstrations. COLLAGE addresses this by leveraging multiple cues for better relevance.

Method: COLLAGE uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to weight pre-selected data subsets based on their predictive performance for the target task. It employs importance sampling during policy training.

Result: COLLAGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.1% in simulation and 16.6% in real-world tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: COLLAGE provides a flexible, feature-agnostic solution for data retrieval in few-shot imitation learning, significantly improving performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the

foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical
robots.

*Jack Zeng,Andreu Matoses Gimenez,Eugene Vinitsky,Javier Alonso-Mora,Sihao Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Decentralized 6-DoF manipulation of cable-suspended loads using MAVs via MARL, eliminating need for global states or inter-MAV communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, flexible, and cost-effective control of MAVs for load manipulation without centralized schemes.

Method: Uses MARL for outer-loop control policies, implicit communication via load pose, and a novel action space design with linear acceleration and body rates.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to centralized methods, supports heterogeneous policies, and remains robust to MAV failures.

Conclusion: Demonstrates successful real-world application of decentralized MARL for MAV teams in dynamic load manipulation.

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete
in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos of experiments:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper surveys Multi-Task Learning (MTL) for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), highlighting its efficiency in handling multiple tasks like perception and prediction within a single model, and identifies future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAVs require multiple tasks for safe navigation, but traditional methods use separate models, leading to inefficiency. MTL offers a unified solution.

Method: The paper reviews MTL applications in CAVs, covering perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration.

Result: MTL improves efficiency and resource utilization in CAVs, but existing methods have limitations.

Conclusion: The survey identifies research gaps and suggests future directions to enhance MTL for CAV systems.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

TL;DR: Hestia introduces a reinforcement learning-based method for autonomous 3D data collection, outperforming manual and traditional systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual 3D data collection is time-consuming; Hestia aims to automate and improve efficiency.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning for 5-DoF next-best-view prediction, with systematic task definition and real-world drone integration.

Result: Robust performance across datasets and real-world feasibility demonstrated.

Conclusion: Hestia is a viable solution for autonomous, efficient 3D data collection.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: MoRe-ERL combines ERL and residual learning to refine trajectories, improving efficiency and adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance task-specific trajectory refinement while preserving critical maneuvers and ensuring smoothness.

Method: Uses B-Spline-based movement primitives for residual adjustments, integrating with ERL methods.

Result: Outperforms training from scratch, achieving better sample efficiency and task performance.

Conclusion: MoRe-ERL is effective for real-world deployment with minimal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VFP improves flow-matching policies for robot manipulation by addressing multi-modality issues with variational latent priors, K-OT alignment, and MoE decoding, achieving 49% better success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional flow-matching methods fail in multi-modal tasks, leading to averaged or ambiguous behaviors.

Method: VFP uses variational latent priors, K-OT for alignment, and MoE decoding to handle multi-modality.

Result: VFP achieves a 49% improvement in task success rate over baselines, with fast inference and compact size.

Conclusion: VFP effectively addresses multi-modality in robot manipulation, outperforming standard flow-based methods.

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

Result: The study highlights innovations in drone design, sensing technologies, and autonomy algorithms that enhance property assessment.

Conclusion: The convergence of drones and physics-aware sensing can transform property assessment into a more efficient and accurate process.

Abstract: The convergence of autonomous indoor drones with physics-aware sensing
technologies promises to transform property assessment from subjective visual
inspection to objective, quantitative measurement. This comprehensive review
examines the technical foundations enabling this paradigm shift across four
critical domains: (1) platform architectures optimized for indoor navigation,
where weight constraints drive innovations in heterogeneous computing,
collision-tolerant design, and hierarchical control systems; (2) advanced
sensing modalities that extend perception beyond human vision, including
hyperspectral imaging for material identification, polarimetric sensing for
surface characterization, and computational imaging with metaphotonics enabling
radical miniaturization; (3) intelligent autonomy through active reconstruction
algorithms, where drones equipped with 3D Gaussian Splatting make strategic
decisions about viewpoint selection to maximize information gain within battery
constraints; and (4) integration pathways with existing property workflows,
including Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems and industry standards
like Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ScrewSplat is an end-to-end RGB-based method for articulated object recognition, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and enabling zero-shot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for articulated object recognition rely on strong assumptions or additional inputs, limiting real-world practicality.

Method: Randomly initializes screw axes, iteratively optimizes them, and integrates with Gaussian Splatting for 3D geometry reconstruction and part segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy and enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation.

Conclusion: ScrewSplat offers a simple, effective solution for articulated object recognition using only RGB inputs.

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: L3M+P integrates LLMs with classical planning and a dynamic knowledge graph for long-term robot deployment, improving accuracy in state changes and plan generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in scaling classical planning and LLMs for general-purpose robots, including dynamic environment updates and long-term deployments.

Method: Uses an external knowledge graph for world state representation, updated via multi-modal inputs, and enforces consistency rules for planning.

Result: Significant improvement over baselines in registering state changes and generating plans in simulations and real-world robots.

Conclusion: L3M+P effectively bridges the gap between LLMs and classical planning for robots, enhancing adaptability and accuracy.

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

TL;DR: A moment matching-based framework for robust point cloud registration in sparse and noisy conditions, outperforming traditional methods like ICP and NDT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in point cloud registration under sparse and noisy conditions where traditional methods like ICP and NDT struggle.

Method: Treats point clouds as i.i.d. samples from the same distribution, matching generalized Gaussian Radial Basis moments to estimate rigid transformations without explicit point correspondences.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy and robustness than existing methods, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, and improves 4D Radar SLAM performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of moment matching for robust registration in challenging conditions, with performance comparable to LiDAR-based systems.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

TL;DR: A framework for learning object-arrangement tasks from few demonstrations, using a two-stage approach with instance-level semantic fusion for better generalization and zero-shot ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require extensive data to fine-tune vision-language models (VLMs) for unseen environments; this work aims to reduce data dependency.

Method: A two-stage framework: target localization (picking) and region determination (placing), with an instance-level semantic fusion module aligning image crops and text embeddings.

Result: Validated in simulation and real-world, the method improves generalization and achieves zero-shot performance with minimal fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework efficiently learns from few demonstrations, enhancing robotic manipulation in diverse environments.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

TL;DR: QuaDreamer is a panoramic data generation engine for quadruped robots, addressing the lack of training data by mimicking robot motion and enhancing video quality with specialized techniques like VJE, SOC, and PE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data for quadruped robots limits robust perception system development.

Method: QuaDreamer uses Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE) for motion mimicry, Scene-Object Controller (SOC) for video generation, and Panoramic Enhancer (PE) for distortion correction.

Result: Generated videos improve training for panoramic visual perception models, enhancing multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

Conclusion: QuaDreamer provides a viable solution for generating realistic panoramic data, benefiting quadruped robot perception systems.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at

TL;DR: NaviMaster unifies GUI and embodied navigation under a single MDP framework, outperforming state-of-the-art agents through unified training, data mixing, and a novel reward design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI and embodied navigation have evolved separately; unifying them under a common MDP framework could enhance performance and generalization.

Method: NaviMaster uses a visual-target trajectory pipeline, unified RL framework, and distance-aware reward for training on mixed GUI and embodied data.

Result: NaviMaster excels in GUI navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation, validated by out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: The unified approach, data mixing, and reward design in NaviMaster are effective, as shown by superior performance and ablation studies.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation
have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in
isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI
navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically,
NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI
navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation
studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data
mixing strategy, and reward design.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Chunked RL, a framework for fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with offline reinforcement learning, addressing challenges like sample efficiency and action chunking. The proposed CO-RFT algorithm improves success rates and reduces cycle time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLA models with RL faces challenges in sample efficiency, action chunking compatibility, and stability. The paper aims to address these issues.

Method: The authors propose Chunked RL, extending TD learning for action chunking, and CO-RFT, an algorithm combining imitation learning and offline RL for fine-tuning VLA models.

Result: CO-RFT achieves a 57% higher success rate and 22.3% faster cycle time than supervised methods, with 44.3% success in unseen positions.

Conclusion: The Chunked RL framework and CO-RFT algorithm effectively fine-tune VLA models, improving performance and generalization in real-world robotic tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for
developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress
inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization

### [719] [RICL: Adding In-Context Adaptability to Pre-Trained Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02062)
*Kaustubh Sridhar,Souradeep Dutta,Dinesh Jayaraman,Insup Lee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper introduces RICL, a method to inject in-context learning (ICL) into vision-language-action (VLA) models for robotics, enabling task improvement with minimal demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLAs lack in-context learning abilities, limiting their adaptability for new tasks. The goal is to enable easy teaching of new tasks without parameter finetuning.

Method: RICL involves finetuning a VLA model with a small robot demonstration dataset to acquire ICL capabilities, allowing task adaptation via context-based learning.

Result: RICL successfully enables ICL in VLAs, improving task performance with just 10-20 demonstrations per task, even without parameter updates.

Conclusion: RICL provides a practical in-context learning interface for VLAs, enhancing their adaptability for new manipulation tasks and releasing model weights for broader use.

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

*Cui Miao,Tao Chang,Meihan Wu,Hongbin Xu,Chun Li,Ming Li,Xiaodong Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FedVLA is a federated learning framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models, addressing privacy concerns by enabling distributed training without performance loss. It includes task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and expert-driven aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and security concerns limit the adoption of VLA models due to reliance on large-scale user-specific data. FedVLA aims to enable privacy-preserving distributed training.

Method: The framework integrates Instruction Oriented Scene-Parsing for contextual understanding, Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE) for adaptive task learning, and Expert-Driven Aggregation for cross-client knowledge transfer.

Result: FedVLA achieves task success rates comparable to centralized training while preserving privacy. DGMoE improves computational efficiency.

Conclusion: FedVLA effectively balances privacy and performance in VLA model training, making it a viable solution for broader adoption.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates
comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper improves human/object detection in pHRC by introducing a three-class model, achieving 91.11% accuracy with LSTM, GRU, and Transformers, and recommending a sliding window preprocessing strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance safety and workflow in pHRC by refining object detection beyond binary classification to a three-class system for detailed contact analysis.

Method: Collected dataset using Franka Emika Panda robot; evaluated LSTM, GRU, and Transformers with preprocessing strategies like sliding window for time-series analysis.

Result: Best model achieved 91.11% accuracy in real-time testing, proving feasibility of multi-class detection. Sliding window preprocessing was optimal.

Conclusion: Three-class models improve pHRC object detection, with sliding window preprocessing and advanced architectures like LSTM/GRU/Transformers yielding high accuracy.

Abstract: In physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) settings, humans and robots
collaborate directly in shared environments. Robots must analyze interactions
with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical
aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified.
Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish
between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by
evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed
contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot
manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis.
Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets.
The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing,
demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a
comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is
optimal for this task.

*Veeti Ahvonen,Maurice Funk,Damian Heiman,Antti Kuusisto,Carsten Lutz*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) and GPS-networks under soft and hard attention, comparing their capabilities in theoretical (real numbers) and practical (floats) settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the precise expressive power of graph transformers and GPS-networks, particularly in relation to logical frameworks like first-order logic and graded modal logic.

Method: The study examines GTs and GPS-networks under soft and hard attention, comparing their expressive power in real and float scenarios, and links them to logical frameworks like FO, GML, and propositional logic.

Result: GPS-networks match graded modal logic (GML) with the global modality for reals and GML with the counting global modality for floats. GTs are similarly characterized by propositional logic with global and counting modalities.

Conclusion: The study provides a clear characterization of the expressive power of GTs and GPS-networks, linking them to well-known logical frameworks and highlighting differences between real and float settings.

Abstract: Transformers are the basis of modern large language models, but relatively
little is known about their precise expressive power on graphs. We study the
expressive power of graph transformers (GTs) by Dwivedi and Bresson (2020) and
GPS-networks by Ramp\'asek et al. (2022), both under soft-attention and average
hard-attention. Our study covers two scenarios: the theoretical setting with
real numbers and the more practical case with floats. With reals, we show that
in restriction to vertex properties definable in first-order logic (FO),
GPS-networks have the same expressive power as graded modal logic (GML) with
the global modality. With floats, GPS-networks turn out to be equally
expressive as GML with the counting global modality. The latter result is
absolute, not restricting to properties definable in a background logic. We
also obtain similar characterizations for GTs in terms of propositional logic
with the global modality (for reals) and the counting global modality (for
floats).

TL;DR: TensoMeta-VQC is a tensor-train-guided meta-learning framework addressing scalability and noise issues in Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) by decoupling optimization from quantum hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome scalability barriers (barren plateaus, noise sensitivity) in VQC.

Method: Uses a classical tensor-train (TT) network to generate quantum circuit parameters, enhancing noise resilience and gradient propagation.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance and noise tolerance in tasks like quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular simulation.

Conclusion: TensoMeta-VQC offers a scalable, robust solution for practical VQC on near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Computing (VQC) faces fundamental barriers in
scalability, primarily due to barren plateaus and quantum noise sensitivity. To
address these challenges, we introduce TensoMeta-VQC, a novel tensor-train
(TT)-guided meta-learning framework designed to improve the robustness and
scalability of VQC significantly. Our framework fully delegates the generation
of quantum circuit parameters to a classical TT network, effectively decoupling
optimization from quantum hardware. This innovative parameterization mitigates
gradient vanishing, enhances noise resilience through structured low-rank
representations, and facilitates efficient gradient propagation. Based on
Neural Tangent Kernel and statistical learning theory, our rigorous theoretical
analyses establish strong guarantees on approximation capability, optimization
stability, and generalization performance. Extensive empirical results across
quantum dot classification, Max-Cut optimization, and molecular quantum
simulation tasks demonstrate that TensoMeta-VQC consistently achieves superior
performance and robust noise tolerance, establishing it as a principled pathway
toward practical and scalable VQC on near-term quantum devices.

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised learning is introduced, outperforming classical methods in low-label scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance performance in semi-supervised learning where labeled data is scarce, leveraging quantum models for better efficiency.

Method: Developed two quantum models (ILQSSL and IPQSSL) with advanced label propagation in variational quantum circuits, using QR decomposition for graph embedding.

Result: ILQSSL and IPQSSL outperform classical methods on benchmark datasets; entanglement aids generalization, but excessive circuit complexity introduces noise.

Conclusion: Quantum-enhanced models show promise for semi-supervised learning, balancing expressivity and stability, advancing data-efficient classification.

Abstract: This paper develops a hybrid quantum approach for graph-based semi-supervised
learning to enhance performance in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. We
introduce two enhanced quantum models, the Improved Laplacian Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (ILQSSL) and the Improved Poisson Quantum
Semi-Supervised Learning (IPQSSL), that incorporate advanced label propagation
strategies within variational quantum circuits. These models utilize QR
decomposition to embed graph structure directly into quantum states, thereby
enabling more effective learning in low-label settings. We validate our methods
across four benchmark datasets like Iris, Wine, Heart Disease, and German
Credit Card -- and show that both ILQSSL and IPQSSL consistently outperform
leading classical semi-supervised learning algorithms, particularly under
limited supervision. Beyond standard performance metrics, we examine the effect
of circuit depth and qubit count on learning quality by analyzing entanglement
entropy and Randomized Benchmarking (RB). Our results suggest that while some
level of entanglement improves the model's ability to generalize, increased
circuit complexity may introduce noise that undermines performance on current
quantum hardware. Overall, the study highlights the potential of
quantum-enhanced models for semi-supervised learning, offering practical
insights into how quantum circuits can be designed to balance expressivity and
stability. These findings support the role of quantum machine learning in
advancing data-efficient classification, especially in applications constrained
by label availability and hardware limitations.

TL;DR: Quantum neural networks show resilience to data corruption, unlike brittle classical models, and enable efficient quantum machine unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare the reliability of classical and quantum neural networks under data corruption and explore quantum machine unlearning.

Method: Comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on classical and quantum data, analyzing responses to label noise and unlearning efficiency.

Result: Quantum models are resilient to corruption, showing a phase transition-like response, while classical models fail to generalize. Quantum unlearning is efficient.

Conclusion: Quantum machine learning offers resilience and adaptability, promising robust AI.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence hinges on the integrity of its
training data, a foundation often compromised by noise and corruption. Here,
through a comparative study of classical and quantum neural networks on both
classical and quantum data, we reveal a fundamental difference in their
response to data corruption. We find that classical models exhibit brittle
memorization, leading to a failure in generalization. In contrast, quantum
models demonstrate remarkable resilience, which is underscored by a phase
transition-like response to increasing label noise, revealing a critical point
beyond which the model's performance changes qualitatively. We further
establish and investigate the field of quantum machine unlearning, the process
of efficiently forcing a trained model to forget corrupting influences. We show
that the brittle nature of the classical model forms rigid, stubborn memories
of erroneous data, making efficient unlearning challenging, while the quantum
model is significantly more amenable to efficient forgetting with approximate
unlearning methods. Our findings establish that quantum machine learning can
possess a dual advantage of intrinsic resilience and efficient adaptability,
providing a promising paradigm for the trustworthy and robust artificial
intelligence of the future.

*Peiyuan Jiang,Yao Liu,Qiao Liu,Zongshun Zhang,Jiaye Yang,Lu Liu,Daibing Yao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: DRKF method for MER decouples shared and modality-specific features, fuses knowledge, and handles emotional inconsistency, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing modality heterogeneity and emotional inconsistency in MER to improve performance.

Method: Uses ORL for decoupling representations and KF for knowledge fusion, with ED to handle inconsistency.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED datasets.

Conclusion: DRKF effectively improves MER by addressing key challenges and outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify emotional states by
integrating and analyzing information from multiple modalities. However,
inherent modality heterogeneity and inconsistencies in emotional cues remain
key challenges that hinder performance. To address these issues, we propose a
Decoupled Representations with Knowledge Fusion (DRKF) method for MER. DRKF
consists of two main modules: an Optimized Representation Learning (ORL) Module
and a Knowledge Fusion (KF) Module. ORL employs a contrastive mutual
information estimation method with progressive modality augmentation to
decouple task-relevant shared representations and modality-specific features
while mitigating modality heterogeneity. KF includes a lightweight
self-attention-based Fusion Encoder (FE) that identifies the dominant modality
and integrates emotional information from other modalities to enhance the fused
representation. To handle potential errors from incorrect dominant modality
selection under emotionally inconsistent conditions, we introduce an Emotion
Discrimination Submodule (ED), which enforces the fused representation to
retain discriminative cues of emotional inconsistency. This ensures that even
if the FE selects an inappropriate dominant modality, the Emotion
Classification Submodule (EC) can still make accurate predictions by leveraging
preserved inconsistency information. Experiments show that DRKF achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on IEMOCAP, MELD, and M3ED. The source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/PANPANKK/DRKF.

TL;DR: A novel point-wise diffusion model efficiently predicts complex physical systems with shape variations by processing spatio-temporal points independently, outperforming traditional methods in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address inefficiencies in conventional image-based diffusion models for complex physical systems with varying geometries, enabling real-time predictions.

Method: Uses forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points with a point-wise diffusion transformer for denoising, validated on 2D and 3D systems.

Result: Achieves 100-200x speedup, 94.4% faster training, 89.0% fewer parameters, and 28% better accuracy than image-based models.

Conclusion: The point-wise approach is superior for real-time prediction, offering computational efficiency and accuracy across diverse physical systems.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes
spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical
systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in
applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal
points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for
denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on
structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of
any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric
fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with
complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder
fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car
external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for
real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps
compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to
200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our
proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion
model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters
while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive
comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and
Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all
three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate
two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or
incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation
across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using CVAE, cubic spline interpolation, and SLERP accelerates microstructure evolution prediction, achieving high similarity to phase-field simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase-field models are computationally expensive due to complex differential equations, necessitating a faster alternative.

Method: Train a CVAE on phase-field simulation data, use cubic spline interpolation for unknown compositions, and apply SLERP for smooth evolution.

Result: Predicted microstructures closely match phase-field simulations in visual and statistical terms.

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, aiding materials design and optimization.

Abstract: Phase-field models accurately simulate microstructure evolution, but their
dependence on solving complex differential equations makes them computationally
expensive. This work achieves a significant acceleration via a novel deep
learning-based framework, utilizing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder
(CVAE) coupled with Cubic Spline Interpolation and Spherical Linear
Interpolation (SLERP). We demonstrate the method for binary spinodal
decomposition by predicting microstructure evolution for intermediate alloy
compositions from a limited set of training compositions. First, using
microstructures from phase-field simulations of binary spinodal decomposition,
we train the CVAE, which learns compact latent representations that encode
essential morphological features. Next, we use cubic spline interpolation in
the latent space to predict microstructures for any unknown composition.
Finally, SLERP ensures smooth morphological evolution with time that closely
resembles coarsening. The predicted microstructures exhibit high visual and
statistical similarity to phase-field simulations. This framework offers a
scalable and efficient surrogate model for microstructure evolution, enabling
accelerated materials design and composition optimization.

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods for optimizing fleet upgrades: an extended integer programming approach and a machine learning-based method. The latter offers near-optimal solutions with better scalability and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rental-based business models and sustainability demands require efficient fleet upgrade strategies, but conventional methods are computationally expensive.

Method: 1. Extended integer programming for optimal renewal/upgrade decisions. 2. Machine learning transforming the problem into mixed discrete-continuous optimization.

Result: The machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with improved scalability and computational performance in a real-world automotive case study.

Conclusion: The machine learning method is a practical alternative for large-scale fleet management due to its efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Rental-based business models and increasing sustainability requirements
intensify the need for efficient strategies to manage large machine and vehicle
fleet renewal and upgrades. Optimized fleet upgrade strategies maximize overall
utility, cost, and sustainability. However, conventional fleet optimization
does not account for upgrade options and is based on integer programming with
exponential runtime scaling, which leads to substantial computational cost when
dealing with large fleets and repeated decision-making processes. This
contribution firstly suggests an extended integer programming approach that
determines optimal renewal and upgrade decisions. The computational burden is
addressed by a second, alternative machine learning-based method that
transforms the task to a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem. Both
approaches are evaluated in a real-world automotive industry case study, which
shows that the machine learning approach achieves near-optimal solutions with
significant improvements in the scalability and overall computational
performance, thus making it a practical alternative for large-scale fleet
management.

Motivation: Addressing scalability and efficiency in aircraft maintenance scheduling and spatial allocation.

Method: Continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, benchmarked against a heuristic.

Result: Solves 25 aircraft optimally in seconds; handles 40 aircraft with high quality, outperforming heuristics.

Conclusion: The MILP model offers economic benefits and managerial insights, balancing solution time and optimality.

Abstract: Efficient management of aircraft maintenance hangars is a critical
operational challenge, involving complex, interdependent decisions regarding
aircraft scheduling and spatial allocation. This paper introduces a novel
continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to solve this
integrated spatio-temporal problem. By treating time as a continuous variable,
our formulation overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional
discrete-time approaches. The performance of the exact model is benchmarked
against a constructive heuristic, and its practical applicability is
demonstrated through a custom-built visualization dashboard. Computational
results are compelling: the model solves instances with up to 25 aircraft to
proven optimality, often in mere seconds, and for large-scale cases of up to 40
aircraft, delivers high-quality solutions within known optimality gaps. In all
tested scenarios, the resulting solutions consistently and significantly
outperform the heuristic, which highlights the framework's substantial economic
benefits and provides valuable managerial insights into the trade-off between
solution time and optimality.

TL;DR: HESCAPE is a benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, showing gene expression encoders outperform others but contrastive pretraining degrades gene expression prediction due to batch effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods in spatial transcriptomics motivated the creation of HESCAPE.

Method: HESCAPE uses a curated pan-organ dataset to evaluate image and gene expression encoders across pretraining strategies, testing on gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction.

Result: Gene expression encoders perform best, but contrastive pretraining harms gene expression prediction due to batch effects.

Conclusion: Batch-robust multimodal learning is crucial, and HESCAPE provides tools to advance research in spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression
and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular
organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive
benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both
histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a
large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial
transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene
panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and
gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed
their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and
gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression
encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and
that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both
those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,
downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive
pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it
degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders
trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key
factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings
highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in
spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release
HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and
benchmarking tools for the community

Result: Achieved superior reconstruction quality under 4x/5x acceleration, with lowest error and highest similarity index. Phantom experiments confirmed robustness, and computational efficiency improved fivefold.

Conclusion: REFINE-MORE provides an accurate, efficient, and flexible solution for high-dimensional, accelerated qMRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a self-supervised scan-specific deep learning framework

  Methods: We propose REFINE-MORE (REference-Free Implicit NEural
representation with MOdel REinforcement), combining an implicit neural
representation (INR) architecture with a model reinforcement module that
incorporates MR physics constraints. The INR component enables informative
learning of spatiotemporal correlations to initialize multiparametric
quantitative maps, which are then further refined through an unrolled
optimization scheme enforcing data consistency. To improve computational
efficiency, REFINE-MORE integrates a low-rank adaptation strategy that promotes
rapid model convergence. We evaluated REFINE-MORE on accelerated
multiparametric quantitative magnetization transfer imaging for simultaneous
estimation of free water spin-lattice relaxation, tissue macromolecular proton
fraction, and magnetization exchange rate, using both phantom and in vivo brain
data.
  Results: Under 4x and 5x accelerations on in vivo data, REFINE-MORE achieved
superior reconstruction quality, demonstrating the lowest normalized
root-mean-square error and highest structural similarity index compared to
baseline methods and other state-of-the-art model-based and deep learning
approaches. Phantom experiments further showed strong agreement with reference
values, underscoring the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Additionally, the model adaptation strategy improved reconstruction
efficiency by approximately fivefold.
  Conclusion: REFINE-MORE enables accurate and efficient scan-specific
multiparametric qMRI reconstruction, providing a flexible solution for

Result: Achieves Dice score of 93.02% and IoU of 86.7% on BraTS 2021, outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline.

Conclusion: The method improves accuracy and scalability for real-world, multi-center MRI datasets.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

*Fenghe Tang,Bingkun Nian,Jianrui Ding,Wenxin Ma,Quan Quan,Chengqi Dong,Jie Yang,Wei Liu,S. Kevin Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A mobile-optimized model, Mobile U-ViT, is proposed for medical image segmentation, combining efficient CNN and transformer architectures to address the gap between natural and medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mobile models, optimized for natural images, perform poorly on medical tasks due to differences in information density and semantics. A lightweight, high-performing solution is needed.

Method: Mobile U-ViT uses ConvUtr for hierarchical patch embedding, a Large-kernel LGL block for local-global exchange, and a lightweight transformer bottleneck with a cascaded decoder.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight 2D/3D datasets, including zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT is an efficient, powerful, and generalizable solution for mobile medical image analysis.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

### [735] [CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01292)
*Alec Sargood,Lemuel Puglisi,James H. Cole,Neil P. Oxtoby,Daniele Ravì,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CoCoLIT is a diffusion-based latent generative framework for synthesizing amyloid PET scans from structural MRI, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in Alzheimer's Disease screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Amyloid PET scans are costly and less accessible than MRI, but MRI may encode amyloid-related information. CoCoLIT aims to bridge this gap cost-effectively.

Method: CoCoLIT uses a diffusion-based latent generative framework with innovations like Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL), Latent Average Stabilization (LAS) analysis, and ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation.

Result: CoCoLIT significantly outperforms existing methods, improving amyloid-positivity classification by +10.5% (internal dataset) and +23.7% (external dataset).

Conclusion: CoCoLIT offers a promising, cost-effective solution for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease screening by leveraging MRI data.

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible
structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for
large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence
that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless
encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered
through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural
complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing
MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a
lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more
effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned
Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that
incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss
(WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2)
a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an
existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference
consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for
MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available
datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in
amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method
with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external
dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at
https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.

*Neerav Nemchand Gala*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study used transfer learning with EfficientNetV2 for medical image classification, outperforming EfficientNet and ResNet50 but requiring more training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNNs need high computational resources and large datasets; transfer learning was explored to reduce these demands.

Method: Compared EfficientNetV2, EfficientNet, and ResNet50 for classifying brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, pituitary) using transfer learning.

Result: EfficientNetV2 performed best but had longer training times due to its complexity.

Conclusion: EfficientNetV2 is effective for medical image classification but trades performance for increased computational cost.

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the
interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand
extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these
limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong
classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the
study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with
ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and
pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior
performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the
cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

*Mehreen Kanwal,Yunsik Son*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A Deeply Supervised Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework is proposed for accurate brain age estimation from 3D MRI scans, addressing challenges like vanishing gradients and sex-based structural differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain age estimation is crucial for identifying neurodegenerative diseases. Challenges include optimizing 3D models and accounting for sex differences in brain aging.

Method: DSMT-AE uses deep supervision and multitask learning, optimizing brain age prediction alongside sex classification and image reconstruction.

Result: DSMT-AE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenBHB dataset, with robustness across age and sex subgroups.

Conclusion: The framework's components significantly improve predictive accuracy, making it a robust tool for brain age estimation.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D)
T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker
for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage
comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing
spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains
challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain
structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging
trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making
sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of
predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised
Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE
employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at
intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and
multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our
framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary
tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively
capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction
accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark
(OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups.
Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component
substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of
the overall architecture.

*Gustav Müller-Franzes,Debora Jutz,Jakob Nikolas Kather,Christiane Kuhl,Sven Nebelung,Daniel Truhn*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Qwen2.5 outperformed other VLMs in chest radiographs and endoscopy, while all models struggled with retinal fundoscopy. Multimodal input and chain-of-thought reasoning did not improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) across diverse medical imaging tasks using the MedFMC dataset.

Method: Retrospective study comparing model accuracy in three settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Statistical analysis used bootstrapped confidence intervals.

Result: Qwen2.5 excelled in chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy (84.2%), while all models performed poorly in retinal fundoscopy. Multimodal input and reasoning prompts did not enhance accuracy.

Conclusion: Open-source VLMs show promise in certain medical tasks but require further development for complex domains like retinal fundoscopy before clinical use.

Abstract: This retrospective study evaluated five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3,
Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) using the MedFMC dataset. This dataset includes
22,349 images from 7,461 patients encompassing chest radiography (19 disease
multi-label classifications), colon pathology (tumor detection), endoscopy
(colorectal lesion identification), neonatal jaundice assessment (skin
color-based treatment necessity), and retinal fundoscopy (5-point diabetic
retinopathy grading). Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental
settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
Model accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical
comparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved
the highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images
(84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon
pathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both
significantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice
assessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading
accuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All
models struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the
highest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly
better than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input
reduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning
prompts also failed to improve accuracy. The open-source VLMs demonstrated
promising diagnostic capabilities, particularly in chest radiograph
interpretation. However, performance in complex domains such as retinal
fundoscopy was limited, underscoring the need for further development and
domain-specific adaptation before widespread clinical application.

*Yuxin Jing,Jufeng Zhao,Tianpei Zhang,Yiming Zhu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SWAN is a novel framework for infrared small target detection, combining wavelet convolution and attention mechanisms to improve accuracy in complex backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods rely on conventional convolution, which struggles with frequency-domain characteristics of small targets in cluttered backgrounds.

Method: Proposes SWAN with Haar Wavelet Convolution, Shifted Spatial Attention, and Residual Dual-Channel Attention for cross-domain fusion and spatial dependency modeling.

Result: SWAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and robustness, especially in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: SWAN effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating spatial and frequency-domain insights, enhancing target detection.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and
military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in
complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional
convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and
struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small
targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework
designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN
leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion
of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a
Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial
dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual
awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively
calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference
while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods,
showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

*Sagar Singh Gwal,Rajan,Suyash Devgan,Shraddhanjali Satapathy,Abhishek Goyal,Nuruddin Mohammad Iqbal,Vivaan Jain,Prabhat Singh Mallik,Deepali Jain,Ishaan Gupta*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework using vision transformers and attention-based multiple instance learning predicts EGFR mutation status in lung adenocarcinoma from H&E-stained slides, showing high accuracy across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting EGFR mutation status is crucial for treatment decisions in lung adenocarcinoma, especially in Southeast Asian populations with higher mutation rates.

Method: A DL framework combining vision transformers (ViT) and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) was trained on an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and tested on internal (30 WSI) and external (TCGA, 86 WSI) datasets.

Result: The model achieved AUCs of 0.933 (internal) and 0.965 (external), demonstrating consistent performance across datasets.

Conclusion: The framework accurately predicts EGFR mutations from routine pathology slides, even with small datasets, and is suitable for resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of
LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can
help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a
routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping,
especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher
incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent
progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and
classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built
on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and
attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR
mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data
from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets:
Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from
TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets,
with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and
external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently
trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to
several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study
demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status
using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using
foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores transfer learning for aneurysmal SAH segmentation, introducing novel LoRA-based methods (CP-LoRA, DoRA variants) that outperform standard fine-tuning in Unet architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aneurysmal SAH has high mortality, and transfer learning from related hematoma types is underexplored. LoRA methods are rarely applied to CNNs in medical imaging.

Method: Implemented a Unet pre-trained on TBI scans, fine-tuned on SAH data. Introduced CP-LoRA and DoRA variants, comparing them to existing LoRA methods and standard fine-tuning.

Result: LoRA-based methods outperformed standard fine-tuning, with CP-LoRA achieving comparable performance using fewer parameters. Larger hemorrhage volumes improved accuracy.

Conclusion: Transfer learning between hematoma types is feasible, and LoRA-based methods significantly enhance SAH segmentation over conventional Unet fine-tuning.

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological
emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related
hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach.
Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image
segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been
rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We
implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from
124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then
fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health
System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based
on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA,
CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional
components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C,
convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a
multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard
Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods
showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable
performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.
Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance
than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer
learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods
significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH
segmentation.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning Network (DCLNet) is proposed for multi-modal Cranial Nerves (CNs) parcellation, improving performance by combining coarse labels from fiber tractography with expert-annotated precise labels and soft information swapping between MRI modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal CNs parcellation networks underutilize diffusion MRI information, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: DCLNet integrates coarse labels from fiber tractography and precise expert labels, along with a Modality-adaptive Encoder Module (MEM) for soft information swapping between structural and diffusion MRI.

Result: Experiments on the HCP dataset show performance improvements over single-label networks.

Conclusion: Dual-label strategies effectively address ambiguities in CNs parcellation, enhancing segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: The parcellation of Cranial Nerves (CNs) serves as a crucial quantitative
methodology for evaluating the morphological characteristics and anatomical
pathways of specific CNs. Multi-modal CNs parcellation networks have achieved
promising segmentation performance, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI. However, insufficient exploration of diffusion
MRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In
this work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning
Network (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our
DCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber
tractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels
annotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder
Module (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and
diffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human
Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared
to single-label network. This systematic validation underscores the
effectiveness of dual-label strategies in addressing inherent ambiguities in
CNs parcellation tasks.

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to predict pathologists' attention trajectories (scanpaths) on prostate cancer WSIs using a two-stage transformer-based model, outperforming baselines and aiding pathology training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pathology training by predicting expert pathologists' attention movements during WSI grading, enabling decision support systems.

Method: A two-stage model: (1) predicts static attention heatmaps using a transformer, (2) autoregressively predicts dynamic scanpaths from these heatmaps. Fixation extraction preprocesses data.

Result: The model outperforms chance and baseline models in predicting attention scanpaths.

Conclusion: The tool can help trainees learn expert-like attention allocation during WSI reading.

Abstract: The ability to predict the attention of expert pathologists could lead to
decision support systems for better pathology training. We developed methods to
predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists'
attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We
characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m
(magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital
microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs,
and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths
constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction
algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in
the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use
these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the
dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate
attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based
sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different
magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by
sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner
using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging
multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental
results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline
models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in
learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.

TL;DR: A novel joint lossless compression and steganography framework for medical images, improving compression performance, efficiency, and security using adaptive modalities decomposition and segmented message steganography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based compressors for medical images lack a balance between performance and efficiency, and overlook security, which is critical in medical scenarios.

Method: Proposes a dual-path lossless compression framework with adaptive modalities decomposition and segmented message steganography, enhanced by anatomical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning.

Result: Superior compression ratios, efficiency, and security demonstrated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses the trade-off and security issues in medical image compression, with plans to release the source code.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in
lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for
medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
  performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based
  compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is
critical in modern medical scenarios.
  To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression
  and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing
  (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages
  into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an
adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first
  devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global
and local modalities for subsequent dual-path
  lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a
segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to
ensure the security of
  the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based
low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning
  strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our
proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security. The
source code will be made

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for breast tumor segmentation and pCR classification using DCE-MRI, employing a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture and radiomics-driven SNN, achieving improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in DCE-MRI is crucial for tasks like pCR assessment, motivating the development of a robust segmentation and classification approach.

Method: A large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage training strategy (UpKern algorithm) is used for segmentation, followed by a self-normalizing network (SNN) for pCR classification based on radiomic features.

Result: Segmentation achieved a Dice score of 0.67 and NormHD of 0.24. pCR classification reached 57% balanced accuracy, with subgroups up to 75%.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the benefits of larger receptive fields and radiomics, suggesting future work on ensembling and clinical variable integration for further improvements.

Abstract: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as
pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both
segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI
dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage
training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels
using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned
features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen
validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of
0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR
classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic
features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast
DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some
subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive
fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on
advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further
improve performance and generalization. Code:

Motivation: To improve efficiency in 3D medical segmentation by transferring remote sensing methods to healthcare.

designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D
medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture
with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head
self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of
attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through
frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This
design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to
UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art
architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical
datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO
achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training
efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

*Hongzhao Chen,Hexiao Ding,Yufeng Jiang,Jing Lan,Ka Chun Li,Gerald W. Y. Cheng,Sam Ng,Chi Lai Ho,Jing Cai,Liang-ting Lin,Jung Sun Yoo*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: REACT-KD is a framework for tumor classification using CT imaging, leveraging multi-modal knowledge distillation and region-aware guidance to improve reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations, and lack of anatomical guidance in clinical imaging for tumor classification.

Method: Uses a dual-teacher design (PET/CT and degraded CT) to guide a lightweight CT-based student model via semantic alignment and anatomical topology modeling, with a shared CBAM-3D module and modality dropout for robustness.

Result: Achieves 93.4% AUC on PET/CT and 76.6%-81.5% AUC on varying CT dose levels, with high clinical benefit in decision curve analysis.

Conclusion: REACT-KD demonstrates strong performance and reliability, making it promising for real-world diagnostic applications.

Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains
a core challenge due to heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations,
and the lack of structured anatomical guidance. We introduce REACT-KD, a
Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that
transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a
lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design:
one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT,
and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded
low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two
complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits
distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph
distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent
attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD
introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial
or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an
internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose
levels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD
consistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds,
supporting its potential in real-world diagnostics. Code is available at

### [748] [Tackling Ill-posedness of Reversible Image Conversion with Well-posed Invertible Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02111)
*Yuanfei Huang,Hua Huang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a well-posed invertible convolution (WIC) to address ill-posedness in reversible image conversion (RIC), eliminating reliance on random variables and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RIC methods using invertible neural networks (INN) remain ill-posed due to uncertainty from random variables, limiting reliability.

Method: Develops WIC, a well-posed invertible 1x1 convolution, and two networks (WIN-Naïve and WIN) with skip-connections for enhanced memory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like reversible image hiding, rescaling, and decolorization.

Conclusion: The approach overcomes RIC bottlenecks, setting a new benchmark, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to
its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system.
Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods
intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by
incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma,
we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the
underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero
Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle,
we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which
eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development
of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative
networks, WIN-Na\"ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced
skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across
diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and
image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a
new benchmark in the field. Codes are available in

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GR-Gaussian improves 3D Gaussian Splatting for CT reconstruction by reducing needle-like artifacts and enhancing accuracy under sparse-view conditions with denoised point cloud initialization and pixel-graph-aware gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for CT reconstruction suffer from needle-like artifacts under sparse-view conditions due to reliance on average gradient magnitude.

Method: Proposes GR-Gaussian with denoised point cloud initialization and pixel-graph-aware gradient strategies to refine gradient computation and density representation.

Result: Achieves PSNR improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021 on X-3D and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GR-Gaussian is effective for accurate CT reconstruction in sparse-view scenarios, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for CT
reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on the average gradient
magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like
artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses
needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view
conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point
Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and
accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that
refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving
splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and
real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR
improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These
results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT
reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

*Biagio Brattoli,Jack Shi,Jongchan Park,Taebum Lee,Donggeun Yoo,Sergio Pereira*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates MIL techniques to detect six key NSCLC driver mutations, introduces an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder, and outperforms existing models by 3-4%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited genetic testing adoption and focus on few mutations in ML-based CPath tools motivated the study to improve detection of multiple actionable NSCLC mutations.

Method: Uses Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and introduces an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder with varying query and key-value dimensions. Incorporates tissue type directly into the model.

Result: Outperforms top MIL models by 3% on average and over 4% for rare mutations like ERBB2 and BRAF.

Conclusion: The method advances ML-based tests as practical alternatives to standard genetic testing, especially for rare mutations.

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes.
Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains
challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine
Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential
solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations,
limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can
benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK,
BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric
Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying
dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently
extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks,
proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to
directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation
where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting
biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of
3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving
ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic
testing.

*Jingsong Liu,Xiaofeng Deng,Han Li,Azar Kazemi,Christian Grashei,Gesa Wilkens,Xin You,Tanja Groll,Nassir Navab,Carolin Mogler,Peter J. Schüffler*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Star-Diff, a diffusion model for virtual staining from H&E to IHC, addressing challenges like misalignment and structural integrity. It proposes the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS) for evaluation and achieves SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E staining lacks molecular-level data, while IHC is costly and slow. Virtual staining is a solution but faces evaluation and structural challenges.

Method: Star-Diff, a structure-aware diffusion model, combines residual and noise-based pathways for realistic biomarker variability. SFS evaluates diagnostic consistency.

Result: Star-Diff outperforms in visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance on the BCI dataset, offering rapid inference for clinical use.

Conclusion: Star-Diff and SFS provide a practical, clinically aligned solution for virtual IHC synthesis, especially in time-sensitive workflows.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing
tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In
contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker
expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly
and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To
address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising
alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of
synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving
structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this
end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and
evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining
restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image
restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,
Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker
variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC
patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a
clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic
degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level
metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment
and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that
Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity
and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it
presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual
IHC synthesis.

*Jierui Qu,Jianchun Zhao*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes RL-U²Net, a dual-branch U-Net with reinforcement learning for multi-modal 3D heart segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving multi-modal heart segmentation accuracy by addressing spatial inconsistency, static fusion strategies, and inefficient feature alignment.

Method: Uses a dual-branch U-Net with an RL-XAlign module for feature alignment via cross-modal attention and reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves Dice coefficients of 93.1% (CT) and 87.0% (MRI) on the MM-WHS 2017 dataset.

Conclusion: RL-U²Net is effective and superior for multi-modal whole-heart segmentation.

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise
diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating
complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation
accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods
face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities
hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack
adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are
decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a
dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature
alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal
3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network
to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign
module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a
reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that
consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features
are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an
ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from
individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental
results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the
proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving
Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

### [754] [Toward a reliable PWM-based light-emitting diode visual stimulus for improved SSVEP response with minimal visual fatigue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02359)
*Surej Mouli,Ramaswamy Palaniappan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper explores using high-duty-cycle visual stimuli to reduce eye fatigue in SSVEP applications, finding an optimal 85% duty-cycle for peak response and reduced strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP is effective for brain-computer interfacing but causes eye fatigue and accuracy issues with traditional flashing stimuli. High-frequency stimuli reduce fatigue but degrade performance, prompting the study of high-duty-cycle stimuli.

Method: EEG data was recorded using custom LED hardware with duty-cycles ranging from 50% to 95%, tested on ten subjects to assess visual strain and SSVEP response.

Result: Higher duty-cycles reduced visual strain across frequencies, with an 85% duty-cycle yielding a subject-independent peak SSVEP response.

Conclusion: An 85% duty-cycle optimizes SSVEP performance while minimizing fatigue, enhancing practical usability for applications like brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

TL;DR: Deep learning models, especially temporal convolutional networks, outperform signal processing and LSTM networks in detecting equine respiratory sounds and estimating dynamic respiratory rates during high-intensity exercise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve equine welfare by monitoring respiratory parameters like respiratory rate during training, aiding in understanding health and performance impacts.

Method: Comparison of deep learning-based methods (temporal convolutional networks and LSTM networks) with an adapted signal processing method for detecting respiratory events and extracting respiratory rates from microphone recordings.

Result: Temporal convolutional networks achieved the best performance (median F1: 0.94, MAE: 1.44 bpm) compared to LSTM networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE: 3.11 bpm) and signal processing (MAE: 2.36 bpm).

Conclusion: The study successfully automated equine respiratory sound detection and dynamic respiratory rate computation, with future work planned for validation on lower-intensity sounds and different microphone placements.

Abstract: Monitoring respiration parameters such as respiratory rate could be
beneficial to understand the impact of training on equine health and
performance and ultimately improve equine welfare. In this work, we compare
deep learning-based methods to an adapted signal processing method to
automatically detect cyclic respiratory events and extract the dynamic
respiratory rate from microphone recordings during high intensity exercise in
Standardbred trotters. Our deep learning models are able to detect exhalation
sounds (median F1 score of 0.94) in noisy microphone signals and show promising
results on unlabelled signals at lower exercising intensity, where the
exhalation sounds are less recognisable. Temporal convolutional networks were
better at detecting exhalation events and estimating dynamic respiratory rates
(median F1: 0.94, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) $\pm$ Confidence Intervals (CI):
1.44$\pm$1.04 bpm, Limits Of Agreements (LOA): 0.63$\pm$7.06 bpm) than long
short-term memory networks (median F1: 0.90, MAE$\pm$CI: 3.11$\pm$1.58 bpm) and
signal processing methods (MAE$\pm$CI: 2.36$\pm$1.11 bpm). This work is the
first to automatically detect equine respiratory sounds and automatically
compute dynamic respiratory rates in exercising horses. In the future, our
models will be validated on lower exercising intensity sounds and different
microphone placements will be evaluated in order to find the best combination
for regular monitoring.

Motivation: To assess the reliability of EEG-based emotion recognition due to inconsistent performance reports and lack of standardized evaluation protocols.

Method: Reviewed 101 studies using the DEAP dataset, analyzing methodological issues like data leakage, biased feature selection, and flawed hyperparameter optimization.

Result: 87% of studies had methodological errors, inflating accuracy by up to 46%.

Conclusion: Urgent need for stricter methodological standards and evaluation protocols in EEG-based emotion recognition research.

Abstract: The reliability of affective state estimation using EEG data is in question,
given the variability in reported performance and the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols. To investigate this, we reviewed 101 studies, focusing on
the widely used DEAP dataset for emotion recognition. Our analysis revealed
widespread methodological issues that include data leakage from improper
segmentation, biased feature selection, flawed hyperparameter optimization,
neglect of class imbalance, and insufficient methodological reporting. Notably,
we found that nearly 87% of the reviewed papers contained one or more of these
errors. Moreover, through experimental analysis, we observed that such
methodological flaws can inflate the classification accuracy by up to 46%.
These findings reveal fundamental gaps in standardized evaluation practices and
highlight critical deficiencies in the peer review process for machine learning
applications in neuroscience, emphasizing the urgent need for stricter
methodological standards and evaluation protocols.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DBAIOps is a hybrid system combining reasoning LLMs and knowledge graphs for database O&M, outperforming existing methods in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic database O&M methods fail to utilize expert experience effectively, leading to inaccurate or generic results.

Method: DBAIOps uses a heterogeneous graph model, reusable anomaly models, and a two-stage graph evolution mechanism with reasoning LLMs for diagnosis.

Result: DBAIOps achieves 34.85% and 47.22% higher accuracy in root cause and human evaluations compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DBAIOps effectively integrates expert experience and advanced AI for superior database diagnosis.

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for
Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise

Motivation: To address the complexity and specialized skills required in traditional CAD processes, enabling rapid prototyping and generative design.

Method: Proposes a framework where LLMs generate CAD scripts from natural language, iteratively refined via error feedback.

Result: LLMs perform well for simple to moderately complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, requiring multiple refinements.

Conclusion: LLMs have transformative potential in CAD workflows but need improvements in memory retrieval, prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques for robustness.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing industries by enhancing
efficiency, scalability, and innovation. This paper investigates the potential
of LLMs in automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) workflows, by integrating
FreeCAD with LLM as CAD design tool. Traditional CAD processes are often
complex and require specialized sketching skills, posing challenges for rapid
prototyping and generative design. We propose a framework where LLMs generate
initial CAD scripts from natural language descriptions, which are then executed
and refined iteratively based on error feedback. Through a series of
experiments with increasing complexity, we assess the effectiveness of this
approach. Our findings reveal that LLMs perform well for simple to moderately
complex designs but struggle with highly constrained models, necessitating
multiple refinements. The study highlights the need for improved memory
retrieval, adaptive prompt engineering, and hybrid AI techniques to enhance
script robustness. Future directions include integrating cloud-based execution
and exploring advanced LLM capabilities to further streamline CAD automation.

intelligent feedback to augment human cognition. Specifically, we leverage deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) to provide adaptive time pressure feedback to
improve user performance in a math arithmetic task. Time pressure feedback
could either improve or deteriorate user performance by regulating user
attention and anxiety. Adaptive time pressure feedback controlled by a DRL
policy according to users' real-time performance could potentially solve this
trade-off problem. However, the DRL training and hyperparameter tuning may
require large amounts of data and iterative user studies. Therefore, we propose
a dual-DRL framework that trains a regulation DRL agent to regulate user
performance by interacting with another simulation DRL agent that mimics user
cognition behaviors from an existing dataset. Our user study demonstrates the
feasibility and effectiveness of the dual-DRL framework in augmenting user
performance, in comparison to the baseline group.

*Nadja R. Ging-Jehli,Russell K. Childers,Joshua Lu,Robert Gemma,Rachel Zhu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is a Supertask paradigm combining cognitive neuroscience, AI, and gaming to study adaptive behavior. It models individual differences and serves as a tool for science, clinical care, and personal growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans and AI adapt to changing environments and improve self-regulated learning, mood, and stress resilience.

Method: GF integrates computational neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming, creating a dynamic environment to assess adaptive behavior across contexts.

Result: GF shows construct validity, uncovers novel learning patterns, and links clinical features to behavioral adaptations.

Conclusion: GF is a versatile platform for advancing science, clinical interventions, and personal development by fostering adaptability and awareness.

Abstract: How do we learn when to persist, when to let go, and when to shift gears?
Gearshift Fellowship (GF) is the prototype of a new Supertask paradigm designed
to model how humans and artificial agents adapt to shifting environment
demands. Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry,
economics, and artificial intelligence, Supertasks combine computational
neurocognitive modeling with serious gaming. This creates a dynamic,
multi-mission environment engineered to assess mechanisms of adaptive behavior
across cognitive and social contexts. Computational parameters explain behavior
and probe mechanisms by controlling the game environment. Unlike traditional
tasks, GF enables neurocognitive modeling of individual differences across
perceptual decisions, learning, and meta-cognitive levels. This positions GF as
a flexible testbed for understanding how cognitive-affective control processes,
learning styles, strategy use, and motivational shifts adapt across contexts
and over time. It serves as an experimental platform for scientists, a
phenotype-to-mechanism intervention for clinicians, and a training tool for
players aiming to strengthen self-regulated learning, mood, and stress
resilience. Online study (n = 60, ongoing) results show that GF recovers
effects from traditional neuropsychological tasks (construct validity),
uncovers novel patterns in how learning differs across contexts and how
clinical features map onto distinct adaptations. These findings pave the way
for developing in-game interventions that foster self-efficacy and agency to
cope with real-world stress and uncertainty. GF builds a new adaptive ecosystem
designed to accelerate science, transform clinical care, and foster individual
growth. It offers a mirror and training ground where humans and machines
co-develop together deeper flexibility and awareness.

### [763] [EthicAlly: a Prototype for AI-Powered Research Ethics Support for the Social Sciences and Humanities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00856)
*Steph Grohmann*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Generative AI (EthicAlly) to address gaps in ethics support for social science and humanities research, offering structured assessments without replacing human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical ethics models often don't fit social science methodologies, leading to inadequate ethics training and REC access in some regions.

Method: Developed EthicAlly, an AI-powered ethics support system using constitutional AI and collaborative prompt development for structured ethics assessments.

Result: EthicAlly provides tailored ethics support, blending universal principles with contextual considerations, easing REC burdens.

Conclusion: Generative AI can bridge ethics support gaps in social sciences, enhancing research ethics without replacing human oversight.

Abstract: In biomedical science, review by a Research Ethics Committee (REC) is an
indispensable way of protecting human subjects from harm. However, in social
science and the humanities, mandatory ethics compliance has long been met with
scepticism as biomedical models of ethics can map poorly onto methodologies
involving complex socio-political and cultural considerations. As a result,
tailored ethics training and support as well as access to RECs with the
necessary expertise is lacking in some areas, including parts of Europe and
low- and middle-income countries. This paper suggests that Generative AI can
meaningfully contribute to closing these gaps, illustrating this claim by
presenting EthicAlly, a proof-of-concept prototype for an AI-powered ethics
support system for social science and humanities researchers. Drawing on
constitutional AI technology and a collaborative prompt development
methodology, EthicAlly provides structured ethics assessment that incorporates
both universal ethics principles and contextual and interpretive considerations
relevant to most social science research. In supporting researchers in ethical
research design and preparation for REC submission, this kind of system can
also contribute to easing the burden on institutional RECs, without attempting
to automate or replace human ethical oversight.

*Ekai Hashimoto,Takeshi Mizumoto,Kohei Nagira,Shun Shiramatsu*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study proposes visualizing human capital by analyzing speech in routine meetings, using conversation visualization technology to quantify speech and examine differences by attributes like gender and job post.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Companies invest in human capital but lack methods to measure the role of conversations. This study addresses this gap by focusing on speech in meetings.

Method: Conversation visualization technology is used to quantify speech. Analysis includes differences by attributes, changes based on participant presence, and correlations with continuous attributes.

Result: The method was tested in SMEs by analyzing speech amounts in weekly meetings, showing its effectiveness in visualizing human capital.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates a novel approach to quantifying human capital through speech analysis in meetings, offering practical insights for organizations.

Abstract: In recent years, many companies have recognized the importance of human
resources and are investing in human capital to revitalize their organizations
and enhance internal communication, thereby fostering innovation. However,
conventional quantification methods have mainly focused on readily measurable
indicators without addressing the fundamental role of conversations in human
capital. This study focuses on routine meetings and proposes strategies to
visualize human capital by analyzing speech amount during these meetings. We
employ conversation visualization technology, which operates effectively, to
quantify speech. We then measure differences in speech amount by attributes
such as gender and job post, changes in speech amount depending on whether
certain participants are present, and correlations between speech amount and
continuous attributes. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we
analyzed speech amounts by departmental affiliation during weekly meetings at
small to medium enterprises.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The study explores user interaction preferences in Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs), identifying enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and conversational quality as predictors of exploratory preference, along with unexpected effectiveness. Five user profiles and demographic influences were also found.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the factors shaping user interaction preferences in CRSs, which currently remain underexplored.

Method: A within-subjects study with 139 participants experiencing two scripted CRS dialogues, followed by ratings and logistic regression analysis.

Result: Preference for exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and conversational quality, with unexpected effectiveness. Five user profiles and demographic influences (age, gender, control preference) were identified.

Conclusion: The findings enhance CRS user modelling by integrating affective, cognitive, and trait-level predictors, informing adaptive dialogue design for conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) deliver personalised
recommendations through multi-turn natural language dialogue and increasingly
support both task-oriented and exploratory interactions. Yet, the factors
shaping user interaction preferences remain underexplored. In this
within-subjects study (\(N = 139\)), participants experienced two scripted CRS
dialogues, rated their experiences, and indicated the importance of eight
system qualities. Logistic regression revealed that preference for the
exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and
conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also
associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user
profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses
indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced
these choices. These findings integrate affective, cognitive, and trait-level
predictors into CRS user modelling and inform autonomy-sensitive,
value-adaptive dialogue design. The proposed predictive and adaptive framework
applies broadly to conversational AI systems seeking to align dynamically with
evolving user needs.

### [766] [Six Guidelines for Trustworthy, Ethical and Responsible Automation Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02371)
*Matouš Jelínek,Nadine Schlicker,Ewart de Visser*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes six design guidelines for accurate trustworthiness assessments in automated systems, derived from interdisciplinary research, to foster calibrated trust and ethical human-automation interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrated trust in automated systems is essential for safe and seamless societal integration, requiring alignment between user perception and actual system trustworthiness.

Method: Derives six design guidelines from literature in human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology, automation research, UX design, and ethics, incorporating principles from pragmatics like common ground and Gricean maxims.

Result: Guidelines aim to provide actionable insights for designers to create systems with relevant trustworthiness cues, fostering calibrated trust and better interactions.

Conclusion: The guidelines can improve human-automation interactions and serve as a tool for evaluating existing systems' trustworthiness assessments.

Abstract: Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for
their safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a
system recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is
factually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate
trustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's
trustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make
informed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system
(Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers
optimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and
responsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived
from existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,
cognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.
We are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically
the cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication
maxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated
systems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped
by both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal
norms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or
scenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed
guidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated
systems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally
foster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe
interactions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed
heuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems
enable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-experts struggle with expressing intent and managing AI system complexity, necessitating a more intuitive design tool.

Method: AIAP uses a multi-agent system to translate natural language into modular workflows, hiding complexity behind a unified interface.

Result: A user study with 32 participants showed improved ability to design services intuitively using AIAP's features.

Abstract: While many tools are available for designing AI, non-experts still face
challenges in clearly expressing their intent and managing system complexity.
We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input
with visual workflows. AIAP leverages a coordinated multi-agent system to
decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden
from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants
showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic
identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved
participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight
that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers
and enhances user experience in AI service design.

*Yuemin Ma,Uksang Yoo,Yunchao Yao,Shahram Najam Syed,Luca Bondi,Jonathan Francis,Jean Oh,Jeffrey Ichnowski*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: VibeMesh combines vision and active acoustic sensing for accurate hand pose and contact estimation, outperforming vision-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand pose and contact estimation is crucial for robotics, VR, and biomechanics but is hindered by occlusion, subtle cues, and limited sensing.

Method: VibeMesh uses a wearable system with bone-conduction speakers and microphones, paired with a graph-based attention network to process synchronized audio and RGB-D data.

Result: VibeMesh achieves higher accuracy and robustness than vision-only methods, especially in occluded or static-contact scenarios.

Conclusion: VibeMesh offers a lightweight, effective solution for dense hand contact and pose estimation, advancing applications in robotics and VR.

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential
for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical
analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues,
limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible
tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that
fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact
and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse
piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured
acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by
contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based
attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived
hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i)
a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a
cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset
of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across
diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that
VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness,
particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the superior performance of generative AI models in data visualization tasks compared to humans.

Method: Systematic comparative analysis of responses to visualization questions from ChatGPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and humans.

Result: ChatGPT-4 shows a hybrid of human and ChatGPT-3.5 traits, with both models favored over humans for their technical, task-oriented feedback and broader coverage.

Conclusion: The findings suggest potential for improving user experiences by leveraging LLMs' strengths, with broader implications for AI applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates why recent generative AI models outperform humans in
data visualization knowledge tasks. Through systematic comparative analysis of
responses to visualization questions, we find that differences exist between
two ChatGPT models and human outputs over rhetorical structure, knowledge
breadth, and perceptual quality. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT-4, as a more
advanced model, displays a hybrid of characteristics from both humans and
ChatGPT-3.5. The two models were generally favored over human responses, while
their strengths in coverage and breadth, and emphasis on technical and
task-oriented visualization feedback collectively shaped higher overall
quality. Based on our findings, we draw implications for advancing user
experiences based on the potential of LLMs and human perception over their
capabilities, with relevance to broader applications of AI.

*Laura Schütz,Sasan Matinfar,Ulrich Eck,Daniel Roth,Nassir Navab*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework for generating context-aware, material-based sounds in AR to enhance realism and interaction by using computer vision and physical modeling synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AR lacks natural sonic interactions, leading to incongruent multisensory experiences and reduced realism when virtual and real objects collide.

Method: The framework uses computer vision to recognize and segment real object materials, then employs physical modeling synthesis to generate real-time, context-aware sounds based on material properties and impact dynamics.

Result: A user study showed material-based sounds significantly improved realism and enabled better material distinction compared to generic sounds.

Conclusion: Context-aware, material-based sounds in AR enhance realism and perception of real-world surroundings.

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects.
However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of
natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no
sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory
experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality
(VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback
of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that
dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual
congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in
AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer
vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's
physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to
generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis.
In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based
sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of
non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that
material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions.
Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar
materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings
show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a
stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world
surroundings.

*Lala Shakti Swarup Ray,Vitor Fortes Rey,Bo Zhou,Paul Lukowicz,Sungho Suh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: ChairPose is a wearable-free, pressure-sensing system for seated pose estimation, addressing limitations of existing methods like occlusion and privacy concerns. It achieves robust generalization across users and chairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prolonged seated activity raises health and ergonomic concerns, but current posture sensing methods (vision-based/wearable) have issues like occlusion, discomfort, and privacy.

Method: ChairPose uses a two-stage generative model trained on pressure maps from a sensing mattress, incorporating chair morphology and physics-driven data augmentation.

Result: Tested on 8 users and 4 chairs, ChairPose achieves 89.4 mm mean joint position error for unseen users/chairs, showing strong generalization.

Conclusion: ChairPose enables occlusion-free, privacy-preserving pose estimation, expanding applications in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive interfaces.

Abstract: Prolonged seated activity is increasingly common in modern environments,
raising concerns around musculoskeletal health, ergonomics, and the design of
responsive interactive systems. Existing posture sensing methods such as
vision-based or wearable approaches face limitations including occlusion,
privacy concerns, user discomfort, and restricted deployment flexibility. We
introduce ChairPose, the first full body, wearable free seated pose estimation
system that relies solely on pressure sensing and operates independently of
chair geometry. ChairPose employs a two stage generative model trained on
pressure maps captured from a thin, chair agnostic sensing mattress. Unlike
prior approaches, our method explicitly incorporates chair morphology into the
inference process, enabling accurate, occlusion free, and privacy preserving
pose estimation. To support generalization across diverse users and chairs, we
introduce a physics driven data augmentation pipeline that simulates realistic
variations in posture and seating conditions. Evaluated across eight users and
four distinct chairs, ChairPose achieves a mean per joint position error of
89.4 mm when both the user and the chair are unseen, demonstrating robust
generalization to novel real world generalizability. ChairPose expands the
design space for posture aware interactive systems, with potential applications
in ergonomics, healthcare, and adaptive user interfaces.

*Mansi Sharma,Shuang Chen,Philipp Müller,Maurice Rekrut,Antonio Krüger*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for recognizing human search intents (navigational vs. informational) using EEG and eye-tracking, addressing limitations of fixed search times and cross-user prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve real-world applicability of intent recognition by overcoming fixed search times and the need for user-specific training data.

Method: Combines EEG and eye-tracking data, introduces a cross-user prediction method, and releases a dataset with user-determined search times.

Result: Achieves 84.5% accuracy in cross-user intent prediction, comparable to within-user accuracy (85.5%).

Conclusion: The approach enhances flexibility and practicality for real-world visual search assistance.

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks,
they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene
(navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent).
Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and
eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e.,
without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to
real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work
used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark
contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found.
Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios
that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is
impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first
publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs.
informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We
present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG
and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out
evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but
offering much greater flexibility

*Haozhe Zhou,Riku Arakawa,Yuvraj Agarwal,Mayank Goel*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: IMUCoCo is a framework enabling flexible IMU placement for motion sensing, improving adaptability and user experience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IMU-based motion sensing limits users to predefined placements, restricting usability despite the ubiquity of IMU-equipped devices.

Method: IMUCoCo maps signals from any body location into a unified feature space using spatial coordinates, adaptable for downstream tasks like pose estimation and activity recognition.

Result: IMUCoCo achieves accurate pose estimation across diverse sensor placements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in flexibility.

Conclusion: IMUCoCo enhances IMU-based motion sensing by allowing user-defined placements, adapting to context, and suggesting optimal placements for specific use cases.

Abstract: IMUs are regularly used to sense human motion, recognize activities, and
estimate full-body pose. Users are typically required to place sensors in
predefined locations that are often dictated by common wearable form factors
and the machine learning model's training process. Consequently, despite the
increasing number of everyday devices equipped with IMUs, the limited
adaptability has seriously constrained the user experience to only using a few
well-explored device placements (e.g., wrist and ears). In this paper, we
rethink IMU-based motion sensing by acknowledging that signals can be captured
from any point on the human body. We introduce IMU over Continuous Coordinates
(IMUCoCo), a novel framework that maps signals from a variable number of IMUs
placed on the body surface into a unified feature space based on their spatial
coordinates. These features can be plugged into downstream models for pose
estimation and activity recognition. Our evaluations demonstrate that IMUCoCo
supports accurate pose estimation in a wide range of typical and atypical
sensor placements. Overall, IMUCoCo supports significantly more flexible use of
IMUs for motion sensing than the state-of-the-art, allowing users to place
their sensors-laden devices according to their needs and preferences. The
framework also supports the ability to change device locations depending on the
context and suggests placement depending on the use case.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: mCardiacDx is a radar-driven contactless system for arrhythmia monitoring, using precise target localization and an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct heart pulse waveforms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current arrhythmia monitoring methods rely on specialized expertise or cause discomfort; existing contactless systems struggle with disrupted signals from arrhythmia patients.

Method: mCardiacDx employs precise target localization (PTL) to locate reflected signals and an encoder-decoder model to transform them into heart pulse waveforms.

Result: mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art methods in arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, including improved performance for healthy subjects.

Conclusion: mCardiacDx offers an accurate, contactless solution for arrhythmia monitoring, addressing limitations of conventional and existing contactless methods.

Abstract: Arrhythmia is a common cardiac condition that can precipitate severe
complications without timely intervention. While continuous monitoring is
essential for timely diagnosis, conventional approaches such as
electrocardiogram and wearable devices are constrained by their reliance on
specialized medical expertise and patient discomfort from their contact nature.
Existing contactless monitoring, primarily designed for healthy subjects, face
significant challenges when analyzing reflected signals from arrhythmia
patients due to disrupted spatial stability and temporal consistency.
  In this paper, we introduce mCardiacDx, a radar-driven contactless system
that accurately analyzes reflected signals and reconstructs heart pulse
waveforms for arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis. The key contributions of our
work include a novel precise target localization (PTL) technique that locates
reflected signals despite spatial disruptions, and an encoder-decoder model
that transforms these signals into HPWs, addressing temporal inconsistencies.
Our evaluation on a large dataset of healthy subjects and arrhythmia patients
shows that both mCardiacDx and PTL outperform state-of-the-art approach in
arrhythmia monitoring and diagnosis, also demonstrating improved performance in
healthy subjects.

TL;DR: The study explores stakeholder perspectives on integrating computer perception (CP) technologies in healthcare, identifying seven key concerns and proposing "personalized roadmaps" to address them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the risks, benefits, and challenges of CP technologies in healthcare from diverse stakeholder viewpoints.

Method: In-depth, semi-structured interviews with 102 stakeholders, followed by thematic analysis by a multidisciplinary team.

Result: Identified seven concern domains, including trustworthiness, privacy, and philosophical critiques. Proposed "personalized roadmaps" as a solution.

Conclusion: Personalized roadmaps offer a practical framework to balance CP technology use with humanistic care principles.

Abstract: Computer perception (CP) technologies (digital phenotyping, affective
computing and related passive sensing approaches) offer unprecedented
opportunities to personalize healthcare, but provoke concerns about privacy,
bias and the erosion of empathic, relationship-centered practice. A
comprehensive understanding of perceived risks, benefits, and implementation
challenges from those who design, deploy and experience these tools in
real-world settings remains elusive. This study provides the first
evidence-based account of key stakeholder perspectives on the relational,
technical, and governance challenges raised by the integration of CP
technologies into patient care. We conducted in-depth, semi-structured
interviews with 102 stakeholders: adolescent patients and their caregivers,
frontline clinicians, technology developers, and ethics, legal, policy or
philosophy scholars. Transcripts underwent thematic analysis by a
multidisciplinary team; reliability was enhanced through double coding and
consensus adjudication. Stakeholders articulated seven interlocking concern
domains: (1) trustworthiness and data integrity; (2) patient-specific
relevance; (3) utility and workflow integration; (4) regulation and governance;
(5) privacy and data protection; (6) direct and indirect patient harms; and (7)
philosophical critiques of reductionism. To operationalize humanistic
safeguards, we propose "personalized roadmaps": co-designed plans that
predetermine which metrics will be monitored, how and when feedback is shared,
thresholds for clinical action, and procedures for reconciling discrepancies
between algorithmic inferences and lived experience. By translating these
insights into personalized roadmaps, we offer a practical framework for
developers, clinicians and policymakers seeking to harness continuous
behavioral data while preserving the humanistic core of care.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper explores whether explainable AI (XAI)-generated feedback improves surgical skill acquisition compared to traditional coaching, showing promising cognitive and confidence benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surgical training lacks personalized, objective feedback due to limited expert availability and subjective assessments. AI-driven feedback offers a potential solution.

Method: A simulation-based training framework using XAI to analyze surgical videos and provide automated, user-specific feedback compared to traditional coaching in a study with medical students.

Result: XAI feedback improved cognitive load and confidence, with trends suggesting better mimicry of expert practices, though no significant performance gap reduction was found.

Conclusion: The study supports further exploration of XAI in surgical education for adaptive, data-driven feedback to enhance learning and competency assessment.

Abstract: Traditional surgical skill acquisition relies heavily on expert feedback, yet
direct access is limited by faculty availability and variability in subjective
assessments. While trainees can practice independently, the lack of
personalized, objective, and quantitative feedback reduces the effectiveness of
self-directed learning. Recent advances in computer vision and machine learning
have enabled automated surgical skill assessment, demonstrating the feasibility
of automatic competency evaluation. However, it is unclear whether such
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven feedback can contribute to skill
acquisition. Here, we examine the effectiveness of explainable AI
(XAI)-generated feedback in surgical training through a human-AI study. We
create a simulation-based training framework that utilizes XAI to analyze
videos and extract surgical skill proxies related to primitive actions. Our
intervention provides automated, user-specific feedback by comparing trainee
performance to expert benchmarks and highlighting deviations from optimal
execution through understandable proxies for actionable guidance. In a
prospective user study with medical students, we compare the impact of
XAI-guided feedback against traditional video-based coaching on task outcomes,
cognitive load, and trainees' perceptions of AI-assisted learning. Results
showed improved cognitive load and confidence post-intervention. While no
differences emerged between the two feedback types in reducing performance gaps
or practice adjustments, trends in the XAI group revealed desirable effects
where participants more closely mimicked expert practice. This work encourages
the study of explainable AI in surgical education and the development of
data-driven, adaptive feedback mechanisms that could transform learning
experiences and competency assessment.

*Tiantian Feng,Kevin Huang,Anfeng Xu,Xuan Shi,Thanathai Lertpetchpun,Jihwan Lee,Yoonjeong Lee,Dani Byrd,Shrikanth Narayanan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Voxlect is a benchmark for modeling dialects using speech foundation models, evaluated across multiple languages and dialects, with applications in speech recognition and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for comprehensive dialect modeling and evaluation in speech technologies.

Method: Utilized 2M training utterances from 30 speech corpora, evaluated foundation models on dialect classification, robustness, and error analysis.

Result: Demonstrated dialect classification performance, robustness under noise, and applications in ASR and speech generation.

Conclusion: Voxlect is a valuable tool for dialect modeling and downstream applications, publicly available under RAIL license.

Abstract: We present Voxlect, a novel benchmark for modeling dialects and regional
languages worldwide using speech foundation models. Specifically, we report
comprehensive benchmark evaluations on dialects and regional language varieties
in English, Arabic, Mandarin and Cantonese, Tibetan, Indic languages, Thai,
Spanish, French, German, Brazilian Portuguese, and Italian. Our study used over
2 million training utterances from 30 publicly available speech corpora that
are provided with dialectal information. We evaluate the performance of several
widely used speech foundation models in classifying speech dialects. We assess
the robustness of the dialectal models under noisy conditions and present an
error analysis that highlights modeling results aligned with geographic
continuity. In addition to benchmarking dialect classification, we demonstrate
several downstream applications enabled by Voxlect. Specifically, we show that
Voxlect can be applied to augment existing speech recognition datasets with
dialect information, enabling a more detailed analysis of ASR performance
across dialectal variations. Voxlect is also used as a tool to evaluate the
performance of speech generation systems. Voxlect is publicly available with

*Liang Lin,Miao Yu,Kaiwen Luo,Yibo Zhang,Lilan Peng,Dexian Wang,Xuehai Tang,Yuanhe Zhang,Xikang Yang,Zhenhong Zhou,Kun Wang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper investigates vulnerabilities of Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) to backdoor attacks using acoustic triggers, introduces the HIN attack framework, and evaluates risks via the AudioSafe benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of research on audio-specific safety in ALLMs, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic features.

Method: Proposes the HIN framework, which modifies audio waveforms with acoustic triggers (e.g., noise injection, temporal changes) and evaluates ALLM robustness using the AudioSafe benchmark.

Result: ALLMs are highly vulnerable to acoustic triggers (90% attack success rate), show sensitivity differences across features, and exhibit stealthy attack behavior.

Conclusion: ALLMs have critical vulnerabilities to audio-based backdoor attacks, necessitating improved safety measures.

Abstract: As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech
processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While
considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct
characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates:
Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In
response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel
backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features.
HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations
to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise.
These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature
encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To
evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the
AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments
on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical
vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise
and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II)
ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features,
particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III)
poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations,
highlighting the attack's stealth.

TL;DR: A two-stage AI framework improves voice pathology classification by addressing gender bias and data scarcity, achieving high accuracy and MCC scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing classifiers struggle with gender-related acoustic variations and rare disease data scarcity, limiting accurate pathology identification.

Method: Proposes a two-stage framework: gender-specific pathological pattern identification using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, followed by gender-conditioned disease classification. Uses multi-scale resampling and time warping to handle class imbalance.

Result: Achieves 97.63% accuracy and 95.25% MCC, a 5% MCC improvement over single-stage baselines.

Conclusion: The framework advances voice pathology classification by reducing gender bias and improving accuracy through hierarchical modeling.

Abstract: AI-based voice analysis shows promise for disease diagnostics, but existing
classifiers often fail to accurately identify specific pathologies because of
gender-related acoustic variations and the scarcity of data for rare diseases.
We propose a novel two-stage framework that first identifies gender-specific
pathological patterns using ResNet-50 on Mel spectrograms, then performs
gender-conditioned disease classification. We address class imbalance through
multi-scale resampling and time warping augmentation. Evaluated on a merged
dataset from four public repositories, our two-stage architecture with time
warping achieves state-of-the-art performance (97.63\% accuracy, 95.25\% MCC),
with a 5\% MCC improvement over single-stage baseline. This work advances voice
pathology classification while reducing gender bias through hierarchical
modeling of vocal characteristics.

music understanding. Our model features a novel architecture that jointly
processes instrumental and lyrical content, and is trained on a large-scale

*Tongxi Wang,Yang Yu,Qing Wang,Junlang Qian*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: BACH is a novel AI model for song generation using human-editable symbolic scores, addressing limitations in controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and duration. It outperforms existing methods, including commercial solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing song generation methods struggle with controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and duration due to learning music theory from raw audio. BACH aims to overcome these by using symbolic scores.

Method: BACH employs a tokenization strategy and symbolic generative procedure tailored to hierarchical song structure, enabling efficient and high-quality song generation.

Result: BACH achieves state-of-the-art performance in song generation, surpassing commercial solutions like Suno, and excels in human evaluations.

Conclusion: BACH demonstrates the effectiveness of symbolic score-based approaches for song generation, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: Song generation is regarded as the most challenging problem in music AIGC;
nonetheless, existing approaches have yet to fully overcome four persistent
limitations: controllability, generalizability, perceptual quality, and
duration. We argue that these shortcomings stem primarily from the prevailing
paradigm of attempting to learn music theory directly from raw audio, a task
that remains prohibitively difficult for current models. To address this, we
present Bar-level AI Composing Helper (BACH), the first model explicitly
designed for song generation through human-editable symbolic scores. BACH
introduces a tokenization strategy and a symbolic generative procedure tailored
to hierarchical song structure. Consequently, it achieves substantial gains in
the efficiency, duration, and perceptual quality of song generation.
Experiments demonstrate that BACH, with a small model size, establishes a new
SOTA among all publicly reported song generation systems, even surpassing
commercial solutions such as Suno. Human evaluations further confirm its
superiority across multiple subjective metrics.

*Alain Riou,Bernardo Torres,Ben Hayes,Stefan Lattner,Gaëtan Hadjeres,Gaël Richard,Geoffroy Peeters*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: PESTO is a lightweight, self-supervised learning model for single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture, achieving competitive performance without annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a self-supervised pitch estimation method that eliminates the need for annotated data while maintaining high performance and efficiency.

Method: Uses a Siamese architecture with a Toeplitz fully-connected layer for translation equivariance, trained with pitch-shifted pairs and a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective.

Result: Outperforms self-supervised baselines and competes with supervised methods, with superior cross-dataset generalization and low latency (<10 ms).

Conclusion: PESTO is highly efficient and suitable for real-time applications due to its lightweight design and streamable implementation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce PESTO, a self-supervised learning approach for
single-pitch estimation using a Siamese architecture. Our model processes
individual frames of a Variable-$Q$ Transform (VQT) and predicts pitch
distributions. The neural network is designed to be equivariant to
translations, notably thanks to a Toeplitz fully-connected layer. In addition,
we construct pitch-shifted pairs by translating and cropping the VQT frames and
train our model with a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective,
eliminating the need for annotated data. Thanks to this architecture and
training objective, our model achieves remarkable performances while being very
lightweight ($130$k parameters). Evaluations on music and speech datasets
(MIR-1K, MDB-stem-synth, and PTDB) demonstrate that PESTO not only outperforms
self-supervised baselines but also competes with supervised methods, exhibiting
superior cross-dataset generalization. Finally, we enhance PESTO's practical
utility by developing a streamable VQT implementation using cached
convolutions. Combined with our model's low latency (less than 10 ms) and
minimal parameter count, this makes PESTO particularly suitable for real-time
applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Optimal Transport objective for learning

### [784] [ShrutiSense: Microtonal Modeling and Correction in Indian Classical Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01498)
*Rajarshi Ghosh,Jayanth Athipatla*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ShrutiSense is a symbolic pitch processing system for Indian classical music, correcting and completing pitch sequences using a Shruti-aware FST and a grammar-constrained SHMM, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tools ignore microtonal distinctions and raga grammars in Indian classical music, necessitating a specialized system.

Method: Uses a Shruti-aware FST for corrections and a GC-SHMM for completions, incorporating raga-specific rules.

Result: Achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy, with robust performance under noise and consistent accuracy across ragas.

Conclusion: ShrutiSense effectively preserves cultural authenticity in Indian classical music processing.

Abstract: Indian classical music relies on a sophisticated microtonal system of 22
shrutis (pitch intervals), which provides expressive nuance beyond the 12-tone
equal temperament system. Existing symbolic music processing tools fail to
account for these microtonal distinctions and culturally specific raga grammars
that govern melodic movement. We present ShrutiSense, a comprehensive symbolic
pitch processing system designed for Indian classical music, addressing two
critical tasks: (1) correcting westernized or corrupted pitch sequences, and
(2) completing melodic sequences with missing values. Our approach employs
complementary models for different tasks: a Shruti-aware finite-state
transducer (FST) that performs contextual corrections within the 22-shruti
framework and a grammar-constrained Shruti hidden Markov model (GC-SHMM) that
incorporates raga-specific transition rules for contextual completions.
Comprehensive evaluation on simulated data across five ragas demonstrates that
ShrutiSense (FST model) achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy for
correction tasks, with example sequences showing 86.7-90.0% accuracy at
corruption levels of 0.2 to 0.4. The system exhibits robust performance under
pitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas
(90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical
music expression.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper reviews large-scale pretrained bioacoustic foundation models, evaluating their transferability across tasks. BirdMAE and BEATs$_{NLM}$ perform best on BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks, respectively, with attentive probing enhancing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for adaptable deep learning models in biodiversity monitoring by evaluating and comparing bioacoustic foundation models.

Method: Comprehensive review and experimental analysis of bioacoustic models, focusing on architecture, pretraining, and probing strategies (linear and attentive).

Result: BirdMAE excels on BirdSet, while BEATs$_{NLM}$ performs slightly better on BEANS. Attentive probing is crucial for optimal performance.

Conclusion: The study guides practitioners in selecting and adapting models for bioacoustic tasks, emphasizing the importance of probing strategies.

Abstract: Automated bioacoustic analysis is essential for biodiversity monitoring and
conservation, requiring advanced deep learning models that can adapt to diverse
bioacoustic tasks. This article presents a comprehensive review of large-scale
pretrained bioacoustic foundation models and systematically investigates their
transferability across multiple bioacoustic classification tasks. We overview
bioacoustic representation learning including major pretraining data sources
and benchmarks. On this basis, we review bioacoustic foundation models by
thoroughly analysing design decisions such as model architecture, pretraining
scheme, and training paradigm. Additionally, we evaluate selected foundation
models on classification tasks from the BEANS and BirdSet benchmarks, comparing
the generalisability of learned representations under both linear and attentive
probing strategies. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals that
BirdMAE, trained on large-scale bird song data with a self-supervised
objective, achieves the best performance on the BirdSet benchmark. On BEANS,
BEATs$_{NLM}$, the extracted encoder of the NatureLM-audio large audio model,
is slightly better. Both transformer-based models require attentive probing to
extract the full performance of their representations. ConvNext$_{BS}$ and
Perch models trained with supervision on large-scale bird song data remain
competitive for passive acoustic monitoring classification tasks of BirdSet in
linear probing settings. Training a new linear classifier has clear advantages
over evaluating these models without further training. While on BEANS, the
baseline model BEATs trained with self-supervision on AudioSet outperforms
bird-specific models when evaluated with attentive probing. These findings
provide valuable guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate models to
adapt them to new bioacoustic classification tasks via probing.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: HBMNet, a Hierarchical Boundary Modeling Network, addresses audio-visual temporal deepfake localization by combining audio-visual feature encoding, coarse proposal generation, and fine-grained probabilities refinement. It outperforms existing methods like BA-TFD and UMMAFormer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in localizing deepfake regions that span only a few frames in audio-visual content, with most frames remaining unaltered.

Method: HBMNet includes three modules: Audio-Visual Feature Encoder, Coarse Proposal Generator, and Fine-grained Probabilities Generator, leveraging modality-specific encoding, multi-scale cues, and bidirectional boundary-content relationships.

Result: The method improves precision through encoding and fusion, and recall via frame-level supervision. It outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer, showing scalability potential.

Conclusion: HBMNet effectively localizes deepfake regions in audio-visual content, demonstrating superior performance and scalability compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial
manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake
regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest
remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical
Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an
Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level
representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary
regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these
proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality
perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and
fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From
the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional
boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion
primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each
module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes
complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance. HBMNet
outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer and shows improved potential scalability with
more training data.

*Andrea Di Pierno,Luca Guarnera,Dario Allegra,Sebastiano Battiato*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: LAVA is a hierarchical framework for detecting and attributing audio deepfakes, achieving high accuracy in identifying generation technologies and specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of audio deepfakes threatens digital trust, and current methods lack robust attribution to source models.

Method: LAVA uses a convolutional autoencoder for latent representations and two classifiers (ADA and ADMR) for technology and model recognition, with confidence-based rejection for robustness.

Result: ADA achieves F1-scores >95%, and ADMR reaches 96.31% macro F1. Tests confirm robustness against unseen attacks.

Conclusion: LAVA advances deepfake attribution under open-set conditions, validated on benchmarks, with publicly available models and code.

Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in
digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing
audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial
challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice
Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model
recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted
by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized
classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which
identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition
(ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve
robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection
thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong
performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all
datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes.
Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation
analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the
field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model
recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and
accompanied by publicly released models and code. Models and code are available

TL;DR: A novel SQ predictor using ASR model features outperforms existing methods in correlation with human MOS ratings and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SQ prediction by leveraging powerful input features from ASR models, addressing limitations of current non-intrusive metrics.

Method: Proposes a robust SQ predictor using feature representations extracted from an ASR model.

Result: Achieves higher correlation with human MOS ratings than recent approaches and better domain adaptation than DNSMOS.

Conclusion: ASR model features are effective for SQ prediction, offering superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: There has been significant research effort developing neural-network-based
predictors of SQ in recent years. While a primary objective has been to develop
non-intrusive, i.e.~reference-free, metrics to assess the performance of SE
systems, recent work has also investigated the direct inference of neural SQ
predictors within the loss function of downstream speech tasks. To aid in the
training of SQ predictors, several large datasets of audio with corresponding
human labels of quality have been created. Recent work in this area has shown
that speech representations derived from large unsupervised or semi-supervised
foundational speech models are useful input feature representations for neural
SQ prediction. In this work, a novel and robust SQ predictor is proposed based
on feature representations extracted from an ASR model, found to be a powerful
input feature for the SQ prediction task. The proposed system achieves higher
correlation with human MOS ratings than recent approaches on all NISQA test
sets and shows significantly better domain adaption compared to the commonly
used DNSMOS metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of COPD using non-invasive methods like speech analysis could improve patient outcomes and quality of life.

Method: Audio data from 96 Danish participants (half with COPD, half healthy) were analyzed using openSMILE features and x-vector embeddings, with logistic regression for classification.

Result: A best accuracy of 67% was achieved using openSMILE features and logistic regression.

Conclusion: Speech-based analysis shows promise as a scalable, non-invasive screening tool for COPD.

Abstract: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a serious and debilitating
disease affecting millions around the world. Its early detection using
non-invasive means could enable preventive interventions that improve quality
of life and patient outcomes, with speech recently shown to be a valuable
biomarker. Yet, its validity across different linguistic groups remains to be
seen. To that end, audio data were collected from 96 Danish participants
conducting three speech tasks (reading, coughing, sustained vowels). Half of
the participants were diagnosed with different levels of COPD and the other
half formed a healthy control group. Subsequently, we investigated different
baseline models using openSMILE features and learnt x-vector embeddings. We
obtained a best accuracy of 67% using openSMILE features and logistic
regression. Our findings support the potential of speech-based analysis as a
non-invasive, remote, and scalable screening tool as part of future COPD
healthcare solutions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: StutterCut is a semi-supervised framework for dysfluency segmentation, treating it as a graph partitioning problem and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective speech therapy and real-time feedback require precise dysfluency detection and segmentation, but most methods only classify at the utterance level.

Method: StutterCut uses graph partitioning with speech embeddings as nodes, refined by a pseudo-oracle classifier trained on weak labels, controlled by uncertainty from Monte Carlo dropout.

Result: StutterCut achieves higher F1 scores and more precise stuttering onset detection compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: StutterCut provides a robust solution for dysfluency segmentation, validated on real and synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Detecting and segmenting dysfluencies is crucial for effective speech therapy
and real-time feedback. However, most methods only classify dysfluencies at the
utterance level. We introduce StutterCut, a semi-supervised framework that
formulates dysfluency segmentation as a graph partitioning problem, where
speech embeddings from overlapping windows are represented as graph nodes. We
refine the connections between nodes using a pseudo-oracle classifier trained
on weak (utterance-level) labels, with its influence controlled by an
uncertainty measure from Monte Carlo dropout. Additionally, we extend the
weakly labelled FluencyBank dataset by incorporating frame-level dysfluency
boundaries for four dysfluency types. This provides a more realistic benchmark
compared to synthetic datasets. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that StutterCut outperforms existing methods, achieving higher F1 scores and
more precise stuttering onset detection.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new paradigm for audio super-resolution using diffusion models, focusing on inference-time scaling and verifier-algorithm combinations to improve output quality, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models for audio super-resolution are limited by stochastic sampling, leading to high variance and quality constraints. The paper aims to overcome this by exploring multiple solution trajectories during sampling.

Method: Proposes inference-time scaling with task-specific verifiers and two search algorithms (random search and zero-order search) to guide exploration of the solution space.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: up to 9.70% in aesthetics, 5.88% in speaker similarity, 15.20% in word error rate, and 46.98% in spectral distance for speech SR.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates robust and higher-quality audio super-resolution across diverse domains, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks,
including audio super-resolution (SR). In many applications like movie
post-production and album mastering, substantial computational budgets are
available for achieving superior audio quality. However, while existing
diffusion approaches typically increase sampling steps to improve quality, the
performance remains fundamentally limited by the stochastic nature of the
sampling process, leading to high-variance and quality-limited outputs. Here,
rather than simply increasing the number of sampling steps, we propose a
different paradigm through inference-time scaling for SR, which explores
multiple solution trajectories during the sampling process. Different
task-specific verifiers are developed, and two search algorithms, including the
random search and zero-order search for SR, are introduced. By actively guiding
the exploration of the high-dimensional solution space through
verifier-algorithm combinations, we enable more robust and higher-quality
outputs. Through extensive validation across diverse audio domains (speech,
music, sound effects) and frequency ranges, we demonstrate consistent
performance gains, achieving improvements of up to 9.70% in aesthetics, 5.88%
in speaker similarity, 15.20% in word error rate, and 46.98% in spectral
distance for speech SR from 4kHz to 24kHz, showcasing the effectiveness of our
approach. Audio samples are available at:

### [792] [Robust Detection of Planted Subgraphs in Semi-Random Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02158)
*Dor Elimelech,Wasim Huleihel*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper studies planted subgraph detection in semi-random Erdős-Rényi graphs, where an adversary removes edges outside the planted subgraph. It reveals a dichotomy: detection is impossible for subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic density but remains robust for super-logarithmic density. A new efficient algorithm is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work assumes purely random models, which may not handle real-world perturbations. This work introduces a semi-random model with adversarial edge removal to study robustness in detection.

Method: The study analyzes statistical limits under the semi-random model, proving impossibility for certain subgraphs and robustness for others. A computationally efficient detection algorithm is designed and tested.

Result: Detection is impossible for subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic density but robust for super-logarithmic density. The proposed algorithm performs well with rigorous guarantees.

Conclusion: The work establishes a robust framework for planted subgraph detection, advancing semi-random models and computational-statistical trade-offs in graph inference.

Abstract: Detection of planted subgraphs in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs has been
extensively studied, leading to a rich body of results characterizing both
statistical and computational thresholds. However, most prior work assumes a
purely random generative model, making the resulting algorithms potentially
fragile in the face of real-world perturbations. In this work, we initiate the
study of semi-random models for the planted subgraph detection problem, wherein
an adversary is allowed to remove edges outside the planted subgraph before the
graph is revealed to the statistician. Crucially, the statistician remains
unaware of which edges have been removed, introducing fundamental challenges to
the inference task. We establish fundamental statistical limits for detection
under this semi-random model, revealing a sharp dichotomy. Specifically, for
planted subgraphs with strongly sub-logarithmic maximum density detection
becomes information-theoretically impossible in the presence of an adversary,
despite being possible in the classical random model. In stark contrast, for
subgraphs with super-logarithmic density, the statistical limits remain
essentially unchanged; we prove that the optimal (albeit computationally
intractable) likelihood ratio test remains robust. Beyond these statistical
boundaries, we design a new computationally efficient and robust detection
algorithm, and provide rigorous statistical guarantees for its performance. Our
results establish the first robust framework for planted subgraph detection and
open new directions in the study of semi-random models,
computational-statistical trade-offs, and robustness in graph inference
problems.

*Phillip Stephan,Florian Euchner,Stephan ten Brink*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper addresses privacy concerns in telecommunication by proposing a CSI recovery method for multi-antenna receivers to counteract signal obfuscation, ensuring reliable user localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern telecommunication systems pose privacy risks by enabling unauthorized localization. Current obfuscation methods are ineffective against multi-antenna receivers.

Method: The study introduces a CSI recovery method for multi-antenna receivers, inspired by blind multichannel identification, and evaluates its impact on localization techniques.

Result: The proposed method effectively recovers channel features for reliable localization despite signal obfuscation, as demonstrated through real-world measurements.

Conclusion: The work highlights the need for enhanced privacy protections against adversarial radio-based localization systems.

Abstract: The ability of modern telecommunication systems to locate users and objects
in the radio environment raises justified privacy concerns. To prevent
unauthorized localization, single-antenna transmitters can obfuscate the signal
by convolving it with a randomized sequence prior to transmission, which alters
the channel state information (CSI) estimated at the receiver. However, this
strategy is only effective against CSI-based localization systems deploying
single-antenna receivers. Inspired by the concept of blind multichannel
identification, we propose a simple CSI recovery method for multi-antenna
receivers to extract channel features that ensure reliable user localization
regardless of the transmitted signal. We comparatively evaluate the impact of
signal obfuscation and the proposed recovery method on the localization
performance of CSI fingerprinting, channel charting, and classical
triangulation using real-world channel measurements. This work aims to
demonstrate the necessity for further efforts to protect the location privacy
of users from adversarial radio-based localization systems.

TL;DR: Uni-Mol3 is a deep learning framework for multi-molecular reaction modeling, outperforming existing methods in organic reaction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of modeling multi-molecular systems in organic reactions, which remains underexplored despite advances in single-molecular representation learning.

Method: Uni-Mol3 uses a hierarchical pipeline with a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) and two pre-training stages (molecular and reaction pre-training) for progressive learning.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across 10 datasets in 4 downstream tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability.

Conclusion: Uni-Mol3 bridges molecular representation with reaction mechanism understanding, offering a new paradigm for computational modeling of organic reactions.

Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for
new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction
mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable
challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several
state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular
representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where
chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper
introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a
hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core,
Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes
3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a
3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two
pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and
reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a
progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With
prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional
performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task
prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10
datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing
methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions.
This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular
computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic
reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism
understanding.

TL;DR: FastCSP is an open-source workflow using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for efficient and accurate crystal structure prediction (CSP), eliminating the need for DFT in early stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSP is crucial for applications like pharmaceuticals but is computationally expensive due to the large search space and small energy differences between polymorphs.

Method: FastCSP combines random structure generation (Genarris 3.0) with geometry relaxation and free energy calculations using the Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP.

Result: Benchmarked on 28 rigid molecules, FastCSP consistently identifies experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol of the global minimum.

Conclusion: Universal MLIPs enable accurate, system-agnostic CSP, making high-throughput prediction feasible without classical force fields or DFT re-ranking.

Abstract: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) of molecular crystals plays a central role
in applications, such as pharmaceuticals and organic electronics. CSP is
challenging and computationally expensive due to the need to explore a large
search space with sufficient accuracy to capture energy differences of a few
kJ/mol between polymorphs. Dispersion-inclusive density functional theory (DFT)
provides the required accuracy but its computational cost is impractical for a
large number of putative structures. We introduce FastCSP, an open-source,
high-throughput CSP workflow based on machine learning interatomic potentials
(MLIPs). FastCSP combines random structure generation using Genarris 3.0 with
geometry relaxation and free energy calculations powered entirely by the
Universal Model for Atoms (UMA) MLIP. We benchmark FastCSP on a curated set of
28 mostly rigid molecules, demonstrating that our workflow consistently
generates known experimental structures and ranks them within 5 kJ/mol per
molecule of the global minimum. Our results demonstrate that universal MLIPs
can be used across diverse compounds without requiring system-specific tuning.
Moreover, the speed and accuracy afforded by UMA eliminate the need for
classical force fields in the early stages of CSP and for final re-ranking with
DFT. The open-source release of the entire FastCSP workflow significantly
lowers the barrier to accessing CSP. CSP results for a single system can be
obtained within hours on tens of modern GPUs, making high-throughput crystal
structure prediction feasible for a broad range of scientific applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing dynamic and partially observable conditions in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks for 6G.

Method: Multi-agent reinforcement learning with satellite-aided multi-head self-attention, self-imitation learning, and fingerprinting.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 14% in transmission utility and maintains high estimation accuracy.

Conclusion: MAAC-SAM effectively manages connectivity in dynamic vehicular networks, enhancing performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Managing connectivity in integrated satellite-terrestrial vehicular networks
is critical for 6G, yet is challenged by dynamic conditions and partial
observability. This letter introduces the Multi-Agent Actor-Critic with
Satellite-Aided Multi-head self-attention (MAAC-SAM), a novel multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework that enables vehicles to autonomously manage
connectivity across Vehicle-to-Satellite (V2S), Vehicle-to-Infrastructure
(V2I), and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) links. Our key innovation is the
integration of a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows for robust state
estimation even with fluctuating and limited information sharing among
vehicles. The framework further leverages self-imitation learning (SIL) and
fingerprinting to improve learning efficiency and real-time decisions.
Simulation results, based on realistic SUMO traffic models and 3GPP-compliant
configurations, demonstrate that MAAC-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art
terrestrial and satellite-assisted baselines by up to 14% in transmission
utility and maintains high estimation accuracy across varying vehicle densities
and sharing levels.

TL;DR: NetConv, a pre-trained convolution model, improves efficiency and scalability in encrypted traffic classification, outperforming Transformers by 6.88% in performance and 7.41X in throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of Transformer-based models in encrypted traffic classification, such as inefficiency and poor scalability to longer sequences.

Method: Propose NetConv, using stacked traffic convolution layers with window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating, trained via continuous byte masking.

Result: NetConv achieves 6.88% better classification performance and 7.41X higher throughput than existing models.

Conclusion: Convolutions, with NetConv, are a competitive alternative to Transformers for encrypted traffic classification, offering better efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification is vital for modern network management and
security. To reduce reliance on handcrafted features and labeled data, recent
methods focus on learning generic representations through pre-training on
large-scale unlabeled data. However, current pre-trained models face two
limitations originating from the adopted Transformer architecture: (1) Limited
model efficiency due to the self-attention mechanism with quadratic complexity;
(2) Unstable traffic scalability to longer byte sequences, as the explicit
positional encodings fail to generalize to input lengths not seen during
pre-training. In this paper, we investigate whether convolutions, with linear
complexity and implicit positional encoding, are competitive with Transformers
in encrypted traffic classification with pre-training. We first conduct a
systematic comparison, and observe that convolutions achieve higher efficiency
and scalability, with lower classification performance. To address this
trade-off, we propose NetConv, a novel pre-trained convolution model for
encrypted traffic classification. NetConv employs stacked traffic convolution
layers, which enhance the ability to capture localized byte-sequence patterns
through window-wise byte scoring and sequence-wise byte gating. We design a
continuous byte masking pre-training task to help NetConv learn
protocol-specific patterns. Experimental results on four tasks demonstrate that
NetConv improves average classification performance by 6.88% and model
throughput by 7.41X over existing pre-trained models.

Transfer-based\nattacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these\nexamples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that\nadversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability\nto alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook\nthe influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation\nAttack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction\nto guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.\nSpecifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input\ngradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which\nencompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying\non the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation\ndirection, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient\nand the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation\ndirection. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of\nResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the\ntransferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current\ninput transformation methods.

Industry-scale DLRMs are trained\nwith petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To\nutilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled\nup to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations\n(TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training\ndata, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve\nthe quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present\na Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO\nsimultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the\nmodel quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this\nchallenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure\n(i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture\n(i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling\nparadigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with\nthe established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new\ndesign achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently\nsaving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications\nacross multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly\nscaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals,\nsuch as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly\narchitectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces Request-Only Optimizations (ROO), a paradigm for improving storage, training efficiency, and model quality in Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) by treating user requests as training units.", "motivation": "DLRMs are massive-scale ML applications requiring efficient storage and training methods due to their complexity and vast data.", "method": "ROO co-designs data (request-only), infrastructure (request-only pipelines), and model architectures (request-only neural designs) to optimize efficiency.", "result": "ROO reduces storage via feature deduplication and enhances model quality by enabling scalable architectures like Generative Recommenders.", "conclusion": "ROO offers a holistic solution for efficient and high-quality recommendation systems by redefining training units and optimizing computations."}}

In this work, we introduce Fractional\nClassification Loss (FCL), an adaptive robust loss that automatically\ncalibrates its robustness to label noise during training. Built within the\nactive-passive loss framework, FCL employs the fractional derivative of the\nCross-Entropy (CE) loss as its active component and the Mean Absolute Error\n(MAE) as its passive loss component. With this formulation, we demonstrate that\nthe fractional derivative order $\\mu$ spans a family of loss functions that\ninterpolate between MAE-like robustness and CE-like fast convergence.\nFurthermore, we integrate $\\mu$ into the gradient-based optimization as a\nlearnable parameter and automatically adjust it to optimize the trade-off\nbetween robustness and convergence speed. We reveal that FCL's unique property\nestablishes a critical trade-off that enables the stable learning of $\\mu$:\nlower log penalties on difficult or mislabeled examples improve robustness but\nimpose higher penalties on easy or clean data, reducing model confidence in\nthem. Consequently, FCL can dynamically reshape its loss landscape to achieve\neffective classification performance under label noise.

Weighted model\ncounting finds applications across a variety of domains including probabilistic\nreasoning and quantitative risk assessment.\n  Most weighted model counting programs operate by (explicitly or implicitly)\nconverting the input formula into a form that enables arithmetic evaluation,\nusing multiplication for conjunctions and addition for disjunctions. Performing\nthis evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can yield inaccurate results,\nand it cannot quantify the level of precision achieved. Computing with rational\narithmetic gives exact results, but it is costly in both time and space.\n  This paper describes how to combine multiple numeric representations to\nefficiently compute weighted model counts that are guaranteed to achieve a\nuser-specified precision. When all weights are nonnegative, we prove that the\nprecision loss of arithmetic evaluation using floating-point arithmetic can be\ntightly bounded. We show that supplementing a standard IEEE double-precision\nrepresentation with a separate 64-bit exponent, a format we call extended-range\ndouble (ERD), avoids the underflow and overflow issues commonly encountered in\nweighted model counting.

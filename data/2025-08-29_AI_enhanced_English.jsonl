We investigate some fundamental\ntheoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural\nnetwork approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends\nrespectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the\ndistribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a\nnovel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions\nfrom the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further\npropose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.\nNumerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related\nscientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration\nmethod.", "AI": {"tldr": "Proposes VC metric to measure neural network approximation difficulty, identifies VC-tendency and minority-tendency phenomena, and develops a preprocessing framework based on VC for improved approximation.", "motivation": "Neural networks suffer from unpredictable local performance that hinders reliability in critical applications, requiring a quantifiable measure to assess local value changes and approximation stability.", "method": "Introduces VC metric to measure local value changes, investigates theoretical properties, identifies VC-tendency and minority-tendency phenomena, and proposes a variation-based distance metric and preprocessing framework.", "result": "Numerical results from real-world experiments and PDE-related scientific problems support the VC metric's effectiveness and the preprocessing acceleration method.", "conclusion": "VC provides a valuable tool for characterizing neural network approximation behavior, with identified phenomena and preprocessing framework offering practical improvements for neural network reliability and performance."}}

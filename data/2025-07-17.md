### [1] [An Memory-Efficient Framework for Deformable Transformer with Neural Architecture Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11549)
*Wendong Mao,Mingfan Zhao,Jianfeng Guan,Qiwei Dong,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hardware-friendly optimization framework for Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) is proposed, using NAS and a new slicing strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency, validated on FPGA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DAT's irregular memory access patterns hinder efficient hardware deployment; existing methods compromise accuracy or incur high overhead.

Method: Proposes NAS-based slicing to divide input features uniformly, avoiding memory conflicts, and designs an FPGA verification system.

Result: Achieves only 0.2% accuracy drop on ImageNet-1K and reduces DRAM access to 18% of existing methods on FPGA.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances accuracy and hardware efficiency for DAT deployment.

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in
computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions.
However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory
access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware
deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead
or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a
hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture
search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to
automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the
inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model
architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly
optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based
verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on
edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset
demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2%
accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA
show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with
existing DAT acceleration methods.

### [2] [Deformable Dynamic Convolution for Accurate yet Efficient Spatio-Temporal Traffic Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11550)
*Hyeonseok Jin,Geonmin Kim,Kyungbaek Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDCN is a CNN-based model for efficient and accurate spatio-temporal traffic prediction, addressing limitations of GNNs and traditional CNNs by using deformable filters and an encoder-decoder structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome challenges of capturing spatio-temporal heterogeneity and scalability issues in existing methods like GNNs and traditional CNNs.

Method: Proposes Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) with deformable filters and an encoder-decoder structure, incorporating spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks.

Result: DDCN achieves competitive performance on four real-world datasets, demonstrating accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: DDCN shows the potential of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction, offering a scalable and accurate solution.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent
transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas.
Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important,
some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic
patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require
predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data
containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for
accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and
spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically
applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes
transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed
approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder
to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module,
complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can
perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments
on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing
the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal
traffic prediction.

### [3] [Inversion-DPO: Precise and Efficient Post-Training for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11554)
*Zejian Li,Yize Li,Chenye Meng,Zhongni Liu,Yang Ling,Shengyuan Zhang,Guang Yang,Changyuan Yang,Zhiyuan Yang,Lingyun Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inversion-DPO is a novel alignment framework for diffusion models that avoids reward modeling by using DDIM inversion, improving training efficiency and precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing alignment methods for diffusion models are computationally intensive and may reduce accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Inversion-DPO reformulates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion, eliminating the need for auxiliary reward models.

Result: The method shows significant performance improvements in text-to-image and compositional image generation tasks.

Conclusion: Inversion-DPO offers an efficient, high-precision alignment approach for diffusion models, enhancing their applicability to complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by
alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human
preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive
training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial
computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel
alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts
intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic
inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new
post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward
models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and
efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image
generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive
experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO
compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the
trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent
images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a
paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations
and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of
generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient,
high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to
complex realistic generation tasks. Our code is available at

### [4] [Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11558)
*Changlu Chen,Yanbin Liu,Chaoxi Niu,Ling Chen,Tianqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-VFM adapts Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for spatio-temporal forecasting by addressing temporal modeling gaps and modality differences via a dual-branch architecture and reprogramming stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs lack spatio-temporal (ST) correlation modeling, while VFMs offer spatial priors but lack temporal capacity. ST-VFM bridges this gap.

Method: Uses a dual-branch architecture with raw ST and auxiliary flow inputs, plus pre- and post-VFM reprogramming stages for temporal embedding and cross-branch interaction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on ten datasets, proving robustness across VFM backbones like DINO, CLIP, and DEIT.

Conclusion: ST-VFM is a general, effective framework for spatio-temporal forecasting, leveraging VFMs without modifying their backbone.

Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language
processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling
complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language
models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture
one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer
spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In
this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically
reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal
forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise
when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling
capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,
ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs
with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal
difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively
process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming
stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token
Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible
feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral
Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches
through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning
without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten
spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones
(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong
general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

### [5] [Expert Operational GANS: Towards Real-Color Underwater Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11562)
*Ozer Can Devecioglu,Serkan Kiranyaz,Mehmet Yamac,Moncef Gabbouj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: xOp-GAN introduces multiple expert generators for underwater image restoration, outperforming single-regressor models by leveraging specialized networks and a discriminator for inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater image restoration is challenging due to diverse artifacts; single-generator GANs struggle with heterogeneous degradations.

Method: xOp-GAN uses multiple expert generators, each trained on specific quality subsets, and a discriminator to select the best output.

Result: Achieves PSNR up to 25.16 dB on LSUI dataset, surpassing single-regressor models with reduced complexity.

Conclusion: xOp-GAN effectively addresses underwater restoration challenges by combining specialized generators and discriminator-based inference.

Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light
propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater
image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep
regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to
perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network
is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In
order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with
several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset
with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its
restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is
trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image
can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence
score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators
where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression
task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI)
dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB,
surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced
complexity.

### [6] [Data-Driven Meta-Analysis and Public-Dataset Evaluation for Sensor-Based Gait Age Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11571)
*Varun Velankar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reviews gait-based age estimation, analyzing 59 studies and large datasets to compare methods like CNNs and sensor fusion, achieving errors as low as 3.4 years. It identifies key gait metrics and uses interpretable AI to highlight age-related features, concluding with practical guidelines for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Age estimation from gait has applications in healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction, but existing methods vary in accuracy and real-world applicability.

Method: The study reviews 59 studies and analyzes large datasets (OU-ISIR, VersatileGait) to compare CNN, inertial-sensor models, and multi-sensor fusion. It also uses Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: CNNs achieve ~4.2 years error, sensor fusion ~3.4 years. Key gait metrics correlate with age (coefficients ≥0.27). Deep networks reach 96% accuracy in under 0.1s per sample.

Conclusion: The work establishes baselines and guidelines for reducing gait-age error below 3 years in real-world scenarios, combining meta-analysis, large-scale experiments, and interpretable AI.

Abstract: Estimating a person's age from their gait has important applications in
healthcare, security and human-computer interaction. In this work, we review
fifty-nine studies involving over seventy-five thousand subjects recorded with
video, wearable and radar sensors. We observe that convolutional neural
networks produce an average error of about 4.2 years, inertial-sensor models
about 4.5 years and multi-sensor fusion as low as 3.4 years, with notable
differences between lab and real-world data. We then analyse sixty-three
thousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population
dataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride
length, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle
entropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27. Next, we fine-tune a
ResNet34 model and apply Grad-CAM to reveal that the network attends to the
knee and pelvic regions, consistent with known age-related gait changes.
Finally, on a one hundred thousand sample subset of the VersatileGait database,
we compare support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, multilayer
perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, finding that deep networks
achieve up to 96 percent accuracy while processing each sample in under 0.1
seconds. By combining a broad meta-analysis with new large-scale experiments
and interpretable visualizations, we establish solid performance baselines and
practical guidelines for reducing gait-age error below three years in
real-world scenarios.

### [7] [What cat is that? A re-id model for feral cats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11575)
*Victor Caquilpan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPGNet-Cat, a modified version of PPGNet, achieves high accuracy in re-identifying feral cats from camera trap images, aiding wildlife monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feral cats severely impact Australian wildlife; effective monitoring is needed to mitigate their effects.

Method: Adapted PPGNet for feral cats (PPGNet-Cat) and tested contrastive learning like ArcFace loss.

Result: PPGNet-Cat achieved mAP of 0.86 and rank-1 accuracy of 0.95.

Conclusion: PPGNet-Cat is a strong re-ID model for monitoring feral cats.

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife,
placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore,
closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects.
In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges
to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured
by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a
re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main
approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model,
initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats.
This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific
modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally,
various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning
approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat
excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes
establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

### [8] [SketchDNN: Joint Continuous-Discrete Diffusion for CAD Sketch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11579)
*Sathvik Chereddy,John Femiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchDNN introduces a generative model for CAD sketches using a continuous-discrete diffusion process, improving generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in modeling heterogeneous primitive parameterizations and permutation invariance in CAD sketches.

Method: Uses Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, blending Gaussian noise with softmax for discrete variables.

Result: Reduces FID from 16.04 to 7.80 and NLL from 84.8 to 81.33, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: SketchDNN advances CAD sketch generation with superior performance.

Abstract: We present SketchDNN, a generative model for synthesizing CAD sketches that
jointly models both continuous parameters and discrete class labels through a
unified continuous-discrete diffusion process. Our core innovation is
Gaussian-Softmax diffusion, where logits perturbed with Gaussian noise are
projected onto the probability simplex via a softmax transformation,
facilitating blended class labels for discrete variables. This formulation
addresses 2 key challenges, namely, the heterogeneity of primitive
parameterizations and the permutation invariance of primitives in CAD sketches.
Our approach significantly improves generation quality, reducing Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID) from 16.04 to 7.80 and negative log-likelihood (NLL)
from 84.8 to 81.33, establishing a new state-of-the-art in CAD sketch
generation on the SketchGraphs dataset.

### [9] [Interpretable Prediction of Lymph Node Metastasis in Rectal Cancer MRI Using Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11638)
*Benjamin Keel,Aaron Quyn,David Jayne,Maryam Mohsin,Samuel D. Relton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used for lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging in rectal cancer, outperforming traditional CNN-based methods with improved interpretability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current radiological criteria for LNM staging lack accuracy. A VAE is proposed for its ability to encode meaningful visual features and create a structured latent space.

Method: The VAE replaces large pre-trained CNNs, trained on an in-house MRI dataset of 168 patients without neo-adjuvant treatment. Pathological N stage served as ground truth.

Result: The VAE-MLP model achieved AUC 0.86, Sensitivity 0.79, and Specificity 0.85, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: VAE-based feature encoding improves LNM staging accuracy and interpretability, offering a promising alternative to CNNs.

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node
metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node
(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In
this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature
encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the
generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual
features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled
and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models
are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo
neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the
ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'
achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated
metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85
+/- 0.05. Code is available at:

### [10] [Posture-Driven Action Intent Inference for Playing style and Fatigue Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11642)
*Abhishek Jaiswal,Nisheeth Srivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Posture-based mental state inference shows promise for fatigue diagnosis and performance enhancement, validated in cricket with 75% F1 score and 80% AUC-ROC for intent detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in vision-based diagnosis due to sensitive human data, sports settings (like cricket) are explored for diverse emotional state data.

Method: Posture-based motion analysis to identify human intent from activity videos, using weak supervision for validation.

Result: Achieved 75% F1 score and 80% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive vs. defensive shot intent.

Conclusion: Posture provides strong intent signals, offering generalizable techniques for sports analytics and broader human behavior analysis.

Abstract: Posture-based mental state inference has significant potential in diagnosing
fatigue, preventing injury, and enhancing performance across various domains.
Such tools must be research-validated with large datasets before being
translated into practice. Unfortunately, such vision diagnosis faces serious
challenges due to the sensitivity of human subject data. To address this, we
identify sports settings as a viable alternative for accumulating data from
human subjects experiencing diverse emotional states. We test our hypothesis in
the game of cricket and present a posture-based solution to identify human
intent from activity videos. Our method achieves over 75\% F1 score and over
80\% AUC-ROC in discriminating aggressive and defensive shot intent through
motion analysis. These findings indicate that posture leaks out strong signals
for intent inference, even with inherent noise in the data pipeline.
Furthermore, we utilize existing data statistics as weak supervision to
validate our findings, offering a potential solution for overcoming data
labelling limitations. This research contributes to generalizable techniques
for sports analytics and also opens possibilities for applying human behavior
analysis across various fields.

### [11] [VISTA: Monocular Segmentation-Based Mapping for Appearance and View-Invariant Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11653)
*Hannah Shafferman,Annika Thomas,Jouko Kinnari,Michael Ricard,Jose Nino,Jonathan How*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA is a monocular global localization framework using object-based segmentation and tracking, achieving robust performance across viewpoints and seasons without domain-specific training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in global localization due to appearance changes, viewpoint variations, and occlusions in unstructured environments.

Method: Combines object-based segmentation/tracking with submap correspondence search for geometric alignment.

Result: 69% recall improvement over baselines, with a compact map size (0.6% of baselines).

Conclusion: VISTA enables efficient, real-time global localization without domain adaptation.

Abstract: Global localization is critical for autonomous navigation, particularly in
scenarios where an agent must localize within a map generated in a different
session or by another agent, as agents often have no prior knowledge about the
correlation between reference frames. However, this task remains challenging in
unstructured environments due to appearance changes induced by viewpoint
variation, seasonal changes, spatial aliasing, and occlusions -- known failure
modes for traditional place recognition methods. To address these challenges,
we propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame
Alignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that
combines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,
followed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric
consistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA
enables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal
changes, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We
evaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a
69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a
compact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most
memory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time
implementation on resource-constrained platforms.

### [12] [Seeing the Signs: A Survey of Edge-Deployable OCR Models for Billboard Visibility Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11730)
*Maciej Szankin,Vidhyananth Venkatasamy,Lihang Ying*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against CNN-based OCR for outdoor billboard text visibility, revealing VLMs' strengths in scene reasoning but CNN's efficiency for cropped text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately verifying billboard text visibility in real-world conditions is challenging due to complex scenes and weather noise.

Method: Systematically compared VLMs (Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, SmolVLM2) with CNN-based OCR (PaddleOCRv4) on datasets (ICDAR 2015, SVT) with synthetic weather distortions.

Result: VLMs excel in holistic scene reasoning, but lightweight CNN pipelines are more efficient and competitive for cropped text.

Conclusion: CNN-based OCR remains practical for edge deployment, while VLMs show promise for broader scene understanding. Public benchmark and code released for future research.

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet
accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is
still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines
excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor
scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering
end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work
systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B,
InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline
(PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with
synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results
reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight
CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction
of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To
foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and
evaluation code publicly.

### [13] [Beyond Task-Specific Reasoning: A Unified Conditional Generative Framework for Abstract Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11761)
*Fan Shi,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UCGS, a unified framework for solving multiple abstract visual reasoning (AVR) tasks without task-specific designs, enabling zero-shot reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep AVR solvers require task-specific designs or retraining for new tasks, increasing costs. UCGS aims to unify AVR task solving.

Method: Reformulates AVR tasks as predictability estimation of target images and trains a single conditional generative model for multi-task solving.

Result: UCGS achieves abstract reasoning across tasks with one training round and demonstrates zero-shot reasoning on unseen tasks.

Conclusion: UCGS provides a cost-effective, unified solution for AVR tasks, showcasing generalization and zero-shot reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and
generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with
human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial
intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable
success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs
or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often
means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,
which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific
approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver
(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we
prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of
estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we
illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional
generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a
single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning
ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of
zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from
unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

*Peiwen Xia,Tangfei Liao,Wei Zhu,Danhuai Zhao,Jianjun Ke,Kaihao Zhang,Tong Lu,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CorrMoE is a novel framework for pruning image correspondences, addressing cross-domain and cross-scene challenges with de-stylization and adaptive feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with diverse visual domains and scene structures, limiting robustness in applications like 3D reconstruction.

Method: CorrMoE uses a De-stylization Dual Branch for domain shift and a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts for scene diversity, leveraging style mixing and dynamic feature integration.

Result: CorrMoE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The framework enhances robustness in correspondence pruning, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Establishing reliable correspondences between image pairs is a fundamental
task in computer vision, underpinning applications such as 3D reconstruction
and visual localization. Although recent methods have made progress in pruning
outliers from dense correspondence sets, they often hypothesize consistent
visual domains and overlook the challenges posed by diverse scene structures.
In this paper, we propose CorrMoE, a novel correspondence pruning framework
that enhances robustness under cross-domain and cross-scene variations. To
address domain shift, we introduce a De-stylization Dual Branch, performing
style mixing on both implicit and explicit graph features to mitigate the
adverse influence of domain-specific representations. For scene diversity, we
design a Bi-Fusion Mixture of Experts module that adaptively integrates
multi-perspective features through linear-complexity attention and dynamic
expert routing. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CorrMoE achieves superior accuracy and generalization compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The code and pre-trained models are available at

*Kexuan Shi,Zhuang Qi,Jingjing Zhu,Lei Meng,Yaochen Zhang,Haibei Huang,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoConNet improves open-set few-shot image classification by integrating contextual information, enhancing feature diversity, and aligning prototypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook contextual benefits, leading to spurious associations in few-shot scenarios.

Method: ProtoConNet uses three modules: CDS for diverse data patterns, CSR for contextual integration, and PA for prototype alignment.

Result: Experiments show ProtoConNet outperforms existing methods in representation learning and open-set identification.

Conclusion: ProtoConNet effectively enhances few-shot classification by leveraging context and aligning prototypes.

Abstract: Open-set few-shot image classification aims to train models using a small
amount of labeled data, enabling them to achieve good generalization when
confronted with unknown environments. Existing methods mainly use visual
information from a single image to learn class representations to distinguish
known from unknown categories. However, these methods often overlook the
benefits of integrating rich contextual information. To address this issue,
this paper proposes a prototypical augmentation and alignment method, termed
ProtoConNet, which incorporates background information from different samples
to enhance the diversity of the feature space, breaking the spurious
associations between context and image subjects in few-shot scenarios.
Specifically, it consists of three main modules: the clustering-based data
selection (CDS) module mines diverse data patterns while preserving core
features; the contextual-enhanced semantic refinement (CSR) module builds a
context dictionary to integrate into image representations, which boosts the
model's robustness in various scenarios; and the prototypical alignment (PA)
module reduces the gap between image representations and class prototypes,
amplifying feature distances for known and unknown classes. Experimental
results from two datasets verified that ProtoConNet enhances the effectiveness
of representation learning in few-shot scenarios and identifies open-set
samples, making it superior to existing methods.

*Yu Liu,Leyuan Qu,Hanlei Shi,Di Gao,Yuhua Zheng,Taihao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRACE improves DFER by aligning refined text and visual signals, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods underutilize emotional cues in text and lack mechanisms to filter irrelevant facial dynamics.

Method: GRACE integrates dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement (CATE), and token-level cross-modal alignment with entropy-regularized optimal transport.

Result: Significant performance improvement on three benchmarks, especially for ambiguous/imbalanced emotions, setting new SOTA in UAR and WAR.

Conclusion: GRACE effectively addresses gaps in DFER by enhancing cross-modal alignment and filtering irrelevant dynamics.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions
from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in
affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced
semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods
still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional
cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently
effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to
emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular
Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates
dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal
alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient
spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual
descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and
highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference
weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at
the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves
recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or
imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
terms of both UAR and WAR.

*Linwei Chen,Ying Fu,Lin Gu,Dezhi Zheng,Jifeng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) to address aliasing in high-frequency features during downsampling, using adaptive resampling and multi-scale upsampling to retain details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-frequency details are crucial for semantic segmentation but prone to aliasing in downsampling layers.

Method: Proposes SFM with adaptive resampling (ARS) for modulation and Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) for demodulation.

Result: SFM effectively reduces aliasing and retains high-frequency details, validated across multiple tasks.

Conclusion: SFM is a versatile solution for preserving high-frequency information in various architectures and tasks.

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures,
significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However,
according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components
are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling
layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency
Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency
before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.
Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and
design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to
scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the
Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling
(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency
information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves
segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely
and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly
integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural
networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our
method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details
after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and
effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial
robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. The code is

TL;DR: SEPose is a synthetic event-based dataset for human pose estimation, addressing data scarcity in pedestrian monitoring. It includes diverse conditions and is validated with real-world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited data for event-based sensors in pedestrian monitoring under challenging conditions.

Method: Created SEPose dataset using CARLA simulator with dynamic vision sensors, annotating 350K pedestrians. Trained models like RVT and YOLOv8.

Result: Demonstrated sim-to-real generalization by evaluating models on real event-based data.

Conclusion: SEPose fills a data gap and shows promise for improving pedestrian monitoring systems.

Abstract: Event-based sensors have emerged as a promising solution for addressing
challenging conditions in pedestrian and traffic monitoring systems. Their
low-latency and high dynamic range allow for improved response time in
safety-critical situations caused by distracted walking or other unusual
movements. However, the availability of data covering such scenarios remains
limited. To address this gap, we present SEPose -- a comprehensive synthetic
event-based human pose estimation dataset for fixed pedestrian perception
generated using dynamic vision sensors in the CARLA simulator. With nearly 350K
annotated pedestrians with body pose keypoints from the perspective of fixed
traffic cameras, SEPose is a comprehensive synthetic multi-person pose
estimation dataset that spans busy and light crowds and traffic across diverse
lighting and weather conditions in 4-way intersections in urban, suburban, and
rural environments. We train existing state-of-the-art models such as RVT and
YOLOv8 on our dataset and evaluate them on real event-based data to demonstrate
the sim-to-real generalization capabilities of the proposed dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dark-EvGS is a novel event-assisted 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for reconstructing bright multi-view frames in low-light conditions, addressing noise, frame quality, and color consistency issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional cameras struggle in low-light, while event cameras and 3D GS show promise but face challenges like noise and inconsistent color.

Method: Proposes Dark-EvGS with triplet-level supervision and color tone matching for robust radiance field reconstruction. Introduces a real-captured dataset.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in low-light radiance field reconstruction, achieving better frame synthesis.

Conclusion: Dark-EvGS effectively tackles low-light challenges, enabling high-quality multi-view frame synthesis.

Abstract: In low-light environments, conventional cameras often struggle to capture
clear multi-view images of objects due to dynamic range limitations and motion
blur caused by long exposure. Event cameras, with their high-dynamic range and
high-speed properties, have the potential to mitigate these issues.
Additionally, 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables radiance field reconstruction,
facilitating bright frame synthesis from multiple viewpoints in low-light
conditions. However, naively using an event-assisted 3D GS approach still faced
challenges because, in low light, events are noisy, frames lack quality, and
the color tone may be inconsistent. To address these issues, we propose
Dark-EvGS, the first event-assisted 3D GS framework that enables the
reconstruction of bright frames from arbitrary viewpoints along the camera
trajectory. Triplet-level supervision is proposed to gain holistic knowledge,
granular details, and sharp scene rendering. The color tone matching block is
proposed to guarantee the color consistency of the rendered frames.
Furthermore, we introduce the first real-captured dataset for the event-guided
bright frame synthesis task via 3D GS-based radiance field reconstruction.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results than existing
methods, conquering radiance field reconstruction under challenging low-light
conditions. The code and sample data are included in the supplementary

*Mohammad Shahab Sepehri,Berk Tinaz,Zalan Fabian,Mahdi Soltanolkotabi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Hyperphantasia, a benchmark to evaluate mental visualization in MLLMs, revealing a performance gap between humans and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on passive visual perception, neglecting active mental visualization, a critical human cognitive skill.

Method: Hyperphantasia uses four procedurally generated puzzles at three difficulty levels to assess MLLMs.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs show limited mental visualization abilities compared to humans.

Conclusion: Robust mental visualization remains a challenge for MLLMs, though reinforcement learning shows potential for improvement.

Abstract: Mental visualization, the ability to construct and manipulate visual
representations internally, is a core component of human cognition and plays a
vital role in tasks involving reasoning, prediction, and abstraction. Despite
the rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current
benchmarks primarily assess passive visual perception, offering limited insight
into the more active capability of internally constructing visual patterns to
support problem solving. Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill
in humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical
trajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative
simulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic
benchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs
through four carefully constructed puzzles. Each task is procedurally generated
and presented at three difficulty levels, enabling controlled analysis of model
performance across increasing complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap between the performance of
humans and MLLMs. Additionally, we explore the potential of reinforcement
learning to improve visual simulation capabilities. Our findings suggest that
while some models exhibit partial competence in recognizing visual patterns,
robust mental visualization remains an open challenge for current MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaDL improves text-to-image models by addressing relationship discrepancy and attribute leakage, outperforming existing methods in positional accuracy and multi-attribute handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I models struggle with relationship discrepancy and multiple attributes leakage when generating multi-instance images.

Method: Proposes RaDL, using learnable parameters for instance-specific attributes and Relation Attention for relationship-aware features.

Result: RaDL outperforms benchmarks like COCO-Position and DrawBench in positional accuracy and multi-attribute handling.

Conclusion: RaDL effectively generates multi-instance images by considering relationships and attributes, setting a new standard.

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively
generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial
challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of
individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy
and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper
proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL
enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and
generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing
action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on
benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that
RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in
positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships
between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating
images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each
instance within the multi-instance image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PPAR introduces a novel framework for generalizable semantic segmentation using CLIP-based prototypes and progressive alignment to address domain gaps and negative transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for generalizable semantic segmentation struggle with coarse prototypical alignment, overfitting, and uniform treatment of source samples, limiting performance.

Method: PPAR uses CLIP to define Original Text Prototype (OTP) and Visual Text Prototype (VTP), employs progressive alignment, and a prototypical reweighting mechanism to adjust source data contributions.

Result: PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: PPAR effectively addresses domain generalization challenges in semantic segmentation, leveraging CLIP and innovative alignment strategies for superior performance.

Abstract: Generalizable semantic segmentation aims to perform well on unseen target
domains, a critical challenge due to real-world applications requiring high
generalizability. Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as
domain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and
semantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,
existing methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which
may hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source
batch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by
unrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,
ignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable
semantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting
(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.
Specifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and
Visual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for
alignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns
features in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.
Furthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the
reliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect
of irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer). We also
provide a theoretical analysis showing the alignment between our method and
domain generalization theory. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that PPAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its
effectiveness.

Result: Achieves 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval and 3.2% for classification.

Conclusion: LG-CAV-MAE effectively learns cross-modal representations and outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Language-Guided Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked
Autoencoders (LG-CAV-MAE) to improve audio-visual representation learning.
LG-CAV-MAE integrates a pretrained text encoder into contrastive audio-visual
masked autoencoders, enabling the model to learn across audio, visual and text
modalities. To train LG-CAV-MAE, we introduce an automatic method to generate
audio-visual-text triplets from unlabeled videos. We first generate frame-level
captions using an image captioning model and then apply CLAP-based filtering to
ensure strong alignment between audio and captions. This approach yields
high-quality audio-visual-text triplets without requiring manual annotations.
We evaluate LG-CAV-MAE on audio-visual retrieval tasks, as well as an
audio-visual classification task. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving up to a 5.6% improvement in recall@10 for retrieval tasks
and a 3.2% improvement for the classification task.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate tri-modal safety of MLLMs in short-form videos, using a new dataset (SVMA) and attack strategy (ChimeraBreak), revealing vulnerabilities and biases.


<details>

Motivation: Current safety evaluations for MLLMs lack robustness in short-form video contexts and fail to address combined multimodal attacks.

Method: The study presents the SVMA dataset with adversarial attacks and ChimeraBreak, a tri-modal attack strategy targeting visual, auditory, and semantic pathways.

Result: Experiments show high Attack Success Rates (ASR) and distinct failure modes, with biases in misclassifying content.

Conclusion: The findings highlight vulnerabilities in MLLMs and provide insights for improving their robustness and safety.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for content
moderation, yet their robustness in short-form video contexts remains
underexplored. Current safety evaluations often rely on unimodal attacks,
failing to address combined attack vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a comprehensive framework for evaluating the tri-modal safety of MLLMs. First,
we present the Short-Video Multimodal Adversarial (SVMA) dataset, comprising
diverse short-form videos with human-guided synthetic adversarial attacks.
Second, we propose ChimeraBreak, a novel tri-modal attack strategy that
simultaneously challenges visual, auditory, and semantic reasoning pathways.
Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant
vulnerabilities with high Attack Success Rates (ASR). Our findings uncover
distinct failure modes, showing model biases toward misclassifying benign or
policy-violating content. We assess results using LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrating
attack reasoning efficacy. Our dataset and findings provide crucial insights
for developing more robust and safe MLLMs.

*Zhaohong Huang,Yuxin Zhang,Jingjing Xie,Fei Chao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Bias introduces a TTA paradigm with global and spatial biases for VLMs, improving efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTA methods for VLMs struggle with balancing performance and efficiency, prompting the need for a better approach.

Method: GS-Bias uses two learnable biases (global and spatial) added to VLM logits, avoiding full backpropagation for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmarks, with significant improvements over TPT in cross-dataset and domain generalization.

Conclusion: GS-Bias is an efficient and effective TTA method for VLMs, outperforming existing approaches with minimal resource usage.

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time adaptation (TTA) for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have garnered increasing attention, particularly through the use of
multiple augmented views of a single image to boost zero-shot generalization.
Unfortunately, existing methods fail to strike a satisfactory balance between
performance and efficiency, either due to excessive overhead of tuning text
prompts or unstable benefits from handcrafted, training-free visual feature
enhancement. In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),
an efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases
during TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the
global bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning
consistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic
coherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is
worth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the
logits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full
backpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA
methods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving
state-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets. For example, it achieves
a 2.23% improvement over TPT in cross-dataset generalization and a 2.72%
improvement in domain generalization, while requiring only 6.5% of TPT's memory
usage on ImageNet.

TL;DR: EC-Diff optimizes cloud-edge collaboration in diffusion models by reducing cloud inference frequency and finding optimal handoff points, improving speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between cloud denoising time and semantic ambiguity in edge-cloud collaborative diffusion models.

Method: Uses K-step noise approximation and a two-stage greedy search for optimal cloud-edge handoff.

Result: Achieves 2× speedup over cloud inference while maintaining high generation quality.

Conclusion: EC-Diff effectively balances speed and quality in diffusion model inference.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have shown remarkable proficiency in image and video
synthesis. As model size and latency increase limit user experience, hybrid
edge-cloud collaborative framework was recently proposed to realize fast
inference and high-quality generation, where the cloud model initiates
high-quality semantic planning and the edge model expedites later-stage
refinement. However, excessive cloud denoising prolongs inference time, while
insufficient steps cause semantic ambiguity, leading to inconsistency in edge
model output. To address these challenges, we propose EC-Diff that accelerates
cloud inference through gradient-based noise estimation while identifying the
optimal point for cloud-edge handoff to maintain generation quality.
Specifically, we design a K-step noise approximation strategy to reduce cloud
inference frequency by using noise gradients between steps and applying cloud
inference periodically to adjust errors. Then we design a two-stage greedy
search algorithm to efficiently find the optimal parameters for noise
approximation and edge model switching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly enhances generation quality compared to edge
inference, while achieving up to an average $2\times$ speedup in inference
compared to cloud inference. Video samples and source code are available at

### [27] [Unsupervised Part Discovery via Descriptor-Based Masked Image Restoration with Optimized Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11985)
*Jiahao Xia,Yike Wu,Wenjian Huang,Jianguo Zhang,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPAE introduces an unsupervised method for part discovery in images, using masked patches and part descriptors to align features robustly across categories and scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised part discovery methods lack robustness across diverse categories and scenarios, limiting their applicability.

Method: MPAE learns part descriptors and feature maps, fills masked regions using these descriptors, and aligns features with part shapes.

Result: MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts matching actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: MPAE provides a foundation for handling occlusion and exploring part similarity across categories, demonstrating effectiveness in experiments.

Abstract: Part-level features are crucial for image understanding, but few studies
focus on them because of the lack of fine-grained labels. Although unsupervised
part discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot
maintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts
their application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more
effective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part
Autoencoder (MPAE). It first learns part descriptors as well as a feature map
from the inputs and produces patch features from a masked version of the
original images. Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part
descriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.
By restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become
better aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from
unmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that
closely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,
several looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to
identify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an
unsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges
posed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple
categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method robustly
discovers meaningful parts across various categories and scenarios. The code is
available at the project https://github.com/Jiahao-UTS/MPAE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot diffusion pipeline is proposed for blending multiple artistic styles in text-to-image models by fusing denoised latents from separately trained models, using spatial masks for precise control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with controlled, regional style application due to entangled latent spaces and lack of smooth interpolation, often leading to one style dominating.

Method: The method involves style composition on denoised latents from separately trained models, leveraging lower-noise latents for stylistic fusion with spatial masks, and incorporating depth-map conditioning via ControlNet for structural coherence.

Result: The approach successfully achieves region-specific style mixing, preserving individual style fidelity while allowing user-guided blending.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables precise, controlled blending of multiple styles in text-to-image synthesis, addressing limitations of existing models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in
synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic
styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and
lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting
techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to
dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that
naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the
denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of
separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that
lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across
heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise,
region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each
individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure
structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map
conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves
region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ID-EA improves personalized portrait generation by aligning text embeddings with visual identity embeddings, enhancing facial identity consistency and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Textual Inversion methods fail to maintain consistent facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual embeddings.

Method: ID-EA uses an ID-driven Enhancer and ID-conditioned Adapter to refine visual identity embeddings and adapt text conditions for identity preservation.

Result: ID-EA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and is 15 times faster.

Conclusion: ID-EA effectively addresses identity preservation in personalized portrait generation with high efficiency.

Abstract: Recently, personalized portrait generation with a text-to-image diffusion
model has significantly advanced with Textual Inversion, emerging as a
promising approach for creating high-fidelity personalized images. Despite its
potential, current Textual Inversion methods struggle to maintain consistent
facial identity due to semantic misalignments between textual and visual
embedding spaces regarding identity. We introduce ID-EA, a novel framework that
guides text embeddings to align with visual identity embeddings, thereby
improving identity preservation in a personalized generation. ID-EA comprises
two key components: the ID-driven Enhancer (ID-Enhancer) and the ID-conditioned
Adapter (ID-Adapter). First, the ID-Enhancer integrates identity embeddings
with a textual ID anchor, refining visual identity embeddings derived from a
face recognition model using representative text embeddings. Then, the
ID-Adapter leverages the identity-enhanced embedding to adapt the text
condition, ensuring identity preservation by adjusting the cross-attention
module in the pre-trained UNet model. This process encourages the text features
to find the most related visual clues across the foreground snippets. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that ID-EA substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation metrics while
achieving remarkable computational efficiency, generating personalized
portraits approximately 15 times faster than existing approaches.

TL;DR: SAMST is a semi-supervised semantic segmentation method for remote sensing data, leveraging SAM for zero-shot generalization and boundary detection to refine pseudo-labels and improve model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public remote sensing datasets lack universality due to resolution variability and inconsistent land cover definitions, limiting their utility.

Method: SAMST uses supervised model self-training and a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner with three modules: Threshold Filter, Prompt Generation, and Label Refinement.

Result: Experiments on the Potsdam dataset confirm SAMST's effectiveness in improving pseudo-label accuracy and model performance.

Conclusion: SAMST addresses limited labeled data challenges in remote sensing semantic segmentation, showcasing its feasibility and potential.

Abstract: Public remote sensing datasets often face limitations in universality due to
resolution variability and inconsistent land cover category definitions. To
harness the vast pool of unlabeled remote sensing data, we propose SAMST, a
semi-supervised semantic segmentation method. SAMST leverages the strengths of
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in zero-shot generalization and boundary
detection. SAMST iteratively refines pseudo-labels through two main components:
supervised model self-training using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, and
a SAM-based Pseudo-label Refiner. The Pseudo-label Refiner comprises three
modules: a Threshold Filter Module for preprocessing, a Prompt Generation
Module for extracting connected regions and generating prompts for SAM, and a
Label Refinement Module for final label stitching. By integrating the
generalization power of large models with the training efficiency of small
models, SAMST improves pseudo-label accuracy, thereby enhancing overall model
performance. Experiments on the Potsdam dataset validate the effectiveness and
feasibility of SAMST, demonstrating its potential to address the challenges
posed by limited labeled data in remote sensing semantic segmentation.

*Hao Li,Ju Dai,Feng Zhou,Kaida Ning,Lei Li,Junjun Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset for fine-grained expression manipulation, and AUBlendNet, a network for stylized facial animation using AU-Blendshape basis vectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation capabilities, prompting the creation of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet.

Method: AUBlendSet is a blendshape dataset based on 32 facial action units (AUs) across 500 identities. AUBlendNet learns AU-Blendshape basis vectors for stylized facial manipulation.

Result: AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet effectively enable tasks like stylized expression manipulation, speech-driven animation, and emotion recognition augmentation.

Conclusion: AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet are pioneering tools for continuous 3D facial expression manipulation, validated through qualitative and quantitative experiments.

Abstract: While 3D facial animation has made impressive progress, challenges still
exist in realizing fine-grained stylized 3D facial expression manipulation due
to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we introduce the
AUBlendSet, a 3D facial dataset based on AU-Blendshape representation for
fine-grained facial expression manipulation across identities. AUBlendSet is a
blendshape data collection based on 32 standard facial action units (AUs)
across 500 identities, along with an additional set of facial postures
annotated with detailed AUs. Based on AUBlendSet, we propose AUBlendNet to
learn AU-Blendshape basis vectors for different character styles. AUBlendNet
predicts, in parallel, the AU-Blendshape basis vectors of the corresponding
style for a given identity mesh, thereby achieving stylized 3D emotional facial
manipulation. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of AUBlendSet and
AUBlendNet through tasks such as stylized facial expression manipulation,
speech-driven emotional facial animation, and emotion recognition data
augmentation. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
demonstrate the potential and importance of AUBlendSet and AUBlendNet in 3D
facial animation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, AUBlendSet is the first
dataset, and AUBlendNet is the first network for continuous 3D facial
expression manipulation for any identity through facial AUs. Our source code is

### [32] [Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006)
*Linwei Chen,Lin Gu,Ying Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FDAM, a frequency-dynamic attention modulation method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) to address frequency vanishing and loss of details, improving performance in tasks like segmentation and detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs suffer from frequency vanishing due to their attention mechanism acting as a low-pass filter, leading to loss of critical details.

Method: Proposes FDAM with two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) for high-pass filtering and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale) for fine-grained frequency adjustments.

Result: FDAM avoids representation collapse and improves performance in semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results in remote sensing detection.

Conclusion: FDAM effectively modulates frequency responses in ViTs, enhancing performance across various vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision,
demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention
mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the
stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency
vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose
a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention
Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly
modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two
techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling
(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental
elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass
filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and
dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different
frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response
function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we
demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to
consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,
DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic
segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we
apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art
results in single-scale settings. The code is available at

### [33] [Dual form Complementary Masking for Domain-Adaptive Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12008)
*Jiawen Wang,Yinda Chen,Xiaoyu Liu,Che Liu,Dong Liu,Jianqing Gao,Zhiwei Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper reframes masked reconstruction in UDA as a sparse signal problem, proposing MaskTwins, a framework that leverages complementary masks for domain-agnostic feature extraction, outperforming baselines in segmentation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MIM methods in UDA lack theoretical grounding and underutilize masked reconstruction's potential for feature extraction.

Method: MaskTwins integrates masked reconstruction into UDA training, enforcing consistency between predictions of complementary-masked images to extract domain-invariant features.

Result: MaskTwins outperforms baselines in natural and biological image segmentation, demonstrating superior domain-invariant feature extraction.

Conclusion: MaskTwins offers a novel, effective paradigm for domain-adaptive segmentation without separate pre-training.

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency
regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely
treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect
the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked
reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing
feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe
masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and
theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses
superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on
this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA
framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training
pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across
disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked
in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner.
Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods
in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the
significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features
without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for
domain-adaptive segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model is proposed to encode and decode brain activity from fMRI data, predicting visual cortex activity and reconstructing visual inputs. Saliency maps identify key brain regions involved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the temporal resolution gap between natural movie stimuli and fMRI data, and to understand visual processing in films using deep learning models.

Method: Uses temporal convolutional layers in a deep neural encoder-decoder architecture to process fMRI data and predict visual cortex activity.

Result: Identifies middle occipital, fusiform, and calcarine areas as key contributors to visual decoding, aligning with the model's ability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts.

Conclusion: Deep learning models can probe visual processing in films, with brain activity decoding aligning with known visual functions.

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end deep neural encoder-decoder model to encode and
decode brain activity in response to naturalistic stimuli using functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Leveraging temporally correlated input
from consecutive film frames, we employ temporal convolutional layers in our
architecture, which effectively allows to bridge the temporal resolution gap
between natural movie stimuli and fMRI acquisitions. Our model predicts
activity of voxels in and around the visual cortex and performs reconstruction
of corresponding visual inputs from neural activity. Finally, we investigate
brain regions contributing to visual decoding through saliency maps. We find
that the most contributing regions are the middle occipital area, the fusiform
area, and the calcarine, respectively employed in shape perception, complex
recognition (in particular face perception), and basic visual features such as
edges and contrasts. These functions being strongly solicited are in line with
the decoder's capability to reconstruct edges, faces, and contrasts. All in
all, this suggests the possibility to probe our understanding of visual
processing in films using as a proxy the behaviour of deep learning models such
as the one proposed in this paper.

### [35] [SS-DC: Spatial-Spectral Decoupling and Coupling Across Visible-Infrared Gap for Domain Adaptive Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12017)
*Xiwei Zhang,Chunjin Yang,Yiming Xiao,Runtong Zhang,Fanman Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SS-DC, a framework for unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from visible to infrared domains, using a decoupling-coupling strategy to handle multiple subdomains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UDAOD methods treat the RGB domain as unified, ignoring subdomains like daytime or foggy scenes. Decoupling domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features is proposed to improve adaptation.

Method: The SS-DC framework includes a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module for spectral decomposition and a spatial-spectral coupling method. It uses a filter bank and self-distillation loss for decoupling.

Result: The method outperforms existing UDAOD approaches on RGB-IR datasets, including a new protocol on FLIR-ADAS, significantly improving baseline performance.

Conclusion: Decoupling DI and DS features across subdomains enhances RGB-IR domain adaptation, validated by superior results on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain
to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB
domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such
as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the
domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple
subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper
proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In
terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)
module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content
information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can
decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter
bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven
decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In
terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which
realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.
Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the
baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR
datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on
the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

*Yuechen Xie,Jie Song,Yicheng Shan,Xiaoyan Zhang,Yuanyu Wan,Shengxuming Zhang,Jiarui Duan,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DOV4MM, a method for verifying dataset ownership in masked models, addressing a gap in existing techniques tailored for supervised and contrastive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting high-quality open-source datasets from exploitation is critical, but current verification methods are unsuitable for masked models.

Method: DOV4MM leverages the difficulty of reconstructing masked information in the embedding space to verify if a model was pre-trained on a target dataset.

Result: DOV4MM outperforms prior methods, rejecting the null hypothesis with a p-value below 0.05, validated on masked image and language models.

Conclusion: DOV4MM effectively addresses the challenge of dataset ownership verification for masked models, aiding owners in safeguarding their rights.

Abstract: High-quality open-source datasets have emerged as a pivotal catalyst driving
the swift advancement of deep learning, while facing the looming threat of
potential exploitation. Protecting these datasets is of paramount importance
for the interests of their owners. The verification of dataset ownership has
evolved into a crucial approach in this domain; however, existing verification
techniques are predominantly tailored to supervised models and contrastive
pre-trained models, rendering them ill-suited for direct application to the
increasingly prevalent masked models. In this work, we introduce the inaugural
methodology addressing this critical, yet unresolved challenge, termed Dataset
Ownership Verification for Masked Modeling (DOV4MM). The central objective is
to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box model has been pre-trained on a
particular unlabeled dataset, thereby assisting dataset owners in safeguarding
their rights. DOV4MM is grounded in our empirical observation that when a model
is pre-trained on the target dataset, the difficulty of reconstructing masked
information within the embedding space exhibits a marked contrast to models not
pre-trained on that dataset. We validated the efficacy of DOV4MM through ten
masked image models on ImageNet-1K and four masked language models on
WikiText-103. The results demonstrate that DOV4MM rejects the null hypothesis,
with a $p$-value considerably below 0.05, surpassing all prior approaches. Code

TL;DR: The paper proposes MVAR, a model for multivariate air pollutant forecasting, addressing interactions among pollutants and spatial responses, and introduces a new dataset for validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on single-pollutant forecasting, ignoring interactions and spatial diversity, which limits practical utility.

Method: MVAR uses a Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm and Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block to improve efficiency and accuracy.

Result: MVAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves 120-hour forecasting.

Conclusion: MVAR effectively addresses multivariate forecasting needs and improves data utilization, validated by a comprehensive dataset.

Abstract: Air pollutants pose a significant threat to the environment and human health,
thus forecasting accurate pollutant concentrations is essential for pollution
warnings and policy-making. Existing studies predominantly focus on
single-pollutant forecasting, neglecting the interactions among different
pollutants and their diverse spatial responses. To address the practical needs
of forecasting multivariate air pollutants, we propose MultiVariate
AutoRegressive air pollutants forecasting model (MVAR), which reduces the
dependency on long-time-window inputs and boosts the data utilization
efficiency. We also design the Multivariate Autoregressive Training Paradigm,
enabling MVAR to achieve 120-hour long-term sequential forecasting.
Additionally, MVAR develops Meteorological Coupled Spatial Transformer block,
enabling the flexible coupling of AI-based meteorological forecasts while
learning the interactions among pollutants and their diverse spatial responses.
As for the lack of standardized datasets in air pollutants forecasting, we
construct a comprehensive dataset covering 6 major pollutants across 75 cities
in North China from 2018 to 2023, including ERA5 reanalysis data and FuXi-2.0
forecast data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and validate the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture.

TL;DR: SGLoc is a novel localization system that regresses camera poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) using semantic information, achieving high accuracy without initial pose priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate camera pose estimation without relying on prior pose information by leveraging semantic relationships between 2D images and 3D scenes.

Method: Uses a multi-level pose regression strategy and a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm to align 2D images with 3DGS maps, refining poses iteratively.

Result: Outperforms baselines on 12scenes and 7scenes datasets, excelling in global localization without initial pose priors.

Conclusion: SGLoc is effective for pose estimation in scenarios lacking prior pose information, with potential applications in augmented reality and robotics.

Abstract: We propose SGLoc, a novel localization system that directly regresses camera
poses from 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation by leveraging semantic
information. Our method utilizes the semantic relationship between 2D image and
3D scene representation to estimate the 6DoF pose without prior pose
information. In this system, we introduce a multi-level pose regression
strategy that progressively estimates and refines the pose of query image from
the global 3DGS map, without requiring initial pose priors. Moreover, we
introduce a semantic-based global retrieval algorithm that establishes
correspondences between 2D (image) and 3D (3DGS map). By matching the extracted
scene semantic descriptors of 2D query image and 3DGS semantic representation,
we align the image with the local region of the global 3DGS map, thereby
obtaining a coarse pose estimation. Subsequently, we refine the coarse pose by
iteratively optimizing the difference between the query image and the rendered
image from 3DGS. Our SGLoc demonstrates superior performance over baselines on
12scenes and 7scenes datasets, showing excellent capabilities in global
localization without initial pose prior. Code will be available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces IICMVNCD, a framework for multi-view novel class discovery (NCD), addressing limitations of single-view methods and unstable pseudo-labels by leveraging intra-view and inter-view correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NCD methods focus on single-view data and rely on unstable pseudo-labels, limiting their effectiveness for multi-view datasets like multi-omics data.

Method: IICMVNCD uses matrix factorization for intra-view similarity and weighted fusion of factor matrices for inter-view guidance, dynamically adjusting view weights.

Result: Experiments confirm the framework's effectiveness in clustering novel classes in multi-view settings.

Conclusion: IICMVNCD advances NCD by addressing multi-view challenges and improving clustering stability.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which
aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known
classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,
existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on
single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view
data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their
reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in
unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors
such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided
Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to
explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view
level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel
classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into
view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices
capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor
matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,
we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of
novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted
fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known
classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel
class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
approach.

TL;DR: InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework using vision-language models (VLMs) to improve face anti-spoofing (FAS) by addressing semantic understanding and cross-domain redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in FAS, specifically limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains.

Method: Integrates VLMs for better visual perception and employs a meta-domain strategy for unified learning. InstructFLIP decouples instructions into content (spoofing semantics) and style (environment/camera variations).

Result: Outperforms SOTA models in accuracy and reduces training redundancy across domains.

Conclusion: InstructFLIP effectively enhances FAS generalization and efficiency, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand
diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain
generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic
understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We
address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the
perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain
strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple
domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that
leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on
a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions
into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on
the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider
variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA
models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across
diverse domains in FAS. Project website is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage untapped potential in the relationships between temporal motion and spatial semantics in videos for better MR/HD performance.

Method: Proposes MS-DETR, a framework with an encoder for disentangled intra-modal correlations and a decoder for task-wise correlations, enhanced by generation strategies and contrastive denoising learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on four MR/HD benchmarks.

Conclusion: MS-DETR effectively captures motion-semantics features and addresses dataset sparsity, achieving superior performance in MR/HD tasks.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) aim to pinpoint
specific moments and assess clip-wise relevance based on the text query. While
DETR-based joint frameworks have made significant strides, there remains
untapped potential in harnessing the intricate relationships between temporal
motion and spatial semantics within video content. In this paper, we propose
the Motion-Semantics DETR (MS-DETR), a framework that captures rich
motion-semantics features through unified learning for MR/HD tasks. The encoder
first explicitly models disentangled intra-modal correlations within motion and
semantics dimensions, guided by the given text queries. Subsequently, the
decoder utilizes the task-wise correlation across temporal motion and spatial
semantics dimensions to enable precise query-guided localization for MR and
refined highlight boundary delineation for HD. Furthermore, we observe the
inherent sparsity dilemma within the motion and semantics dimensions of MR/HD
datasets. To address this issue, we enrich the corpus from both dimensions by
generation strategies and propose contrastive denoising learning to ensure the
above components learn robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments on four
MR/HD benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art models by a margin. Our code is available at

challenge and a critical necessity for ensuring safety in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast to most existing data-driven approaches that directly
predict future trajectories, we rethink this task from a planning perspective,
advocating a "First Reasoning, Then Forecasting" strategy that explicitly
incorporates behavior intentions as spatial guidance for trajectory prediction.
To achieve this, we introduce an interpretable, reward-driven intention
reasoner grounded in a novel query-centric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)
scheme. Our method first encodes traffic agents and scene elements into a
unified vectorized representation, then aggregates contextual features through
a query-centric paradigm. This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,
a compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within
the given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform
policy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing
valuable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a
hierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state
space models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their
associated probabilities. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse
and nuScenes motion forecasting datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly enhances trajectory prediction confidence, achieving highly
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

### [45] [YOLOv8-SMOT: An Efficient and Robust Framework for Real-Time Small Object Tracking via Slice-Assisted Training and Adaptive Association](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12087)
*Xiang Yu,Xinyao Liu,Guang Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a winning solution for tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT) from UAVs, addressing challenges like scarce appearance features and complex motion. It introduces SliceTrain for detection and a robust tracker for association, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tracking small, agile objects like birds from UAVs is challenging due to scarce features, complex motion, and occlusions. The paper aims to solve these issues for real-world SMOT problems.

Method: Uses tracking-by-detection with SliceTrain for enhanced small object detection and a motion-based tracker (OC-SORT with EMA and adaptive similarity metrics) for robust association.

Result: Achieves an SO-HOTA score of 55.205 on the SMOT4SB test set, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses SMOT challenges, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Tracking small, agile multi-objects (SMOT), such as birds, from an Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective is a highly challenging computer vision task.
The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target
appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined
dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions
and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details
our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small
Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the
tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection
and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training
enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the
synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic
augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for
small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we
designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance
information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)}
mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding
box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can
stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching
an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness
and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems.

*Davide Di Nucci,Matteo Tomei,Guido Borghi,Luca Ciuffreda,Roberto Vezzani,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for accurate 3D vehicle reconstruction from sparse-view inputs by enhancing Gaussian Splatting with selective photometric loss and improved pose estimation using DUSt3R, validated on a novel dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D vehicle reconstruction is crucial for applications like inspection and urban planning, but existing methods rely on dense input views, limiting real-world use.

Method: Enhances Gaussian Splatting with selective photometric loss and replaces standard pose estimation with DUSt3R. Uses depth maps and pose estimation to synthesize views and augment data.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, demonstrating high-quality reconstructions from sparse inputs.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges, offering practical improvements for real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of vehicles is vital for applications such as
vehicle inspection, predictive maintenance, and urban planning. Existing
methods like Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splatting have shown
impressive results but remain limited by their reliance on dense input views,
which hinders real-world applicability. This paper addresses the challenge of
reconstructing vehicles from sparse-view inputs, leveraging depth maps and a
robust pose estimation architecture to synthesize novel views and augment
training data. Specifically, we enhance Gaussian Splatting by integrating a
selective photometric loss, applied only to high-confidence pixels, and
replacing standard Structure-from-Motion pipelines with the DUSt3R architecture
to improve camera pose estimation. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset
featuring both synthetic and real-world public transportation vehicles,
enabling extensive evaluation of our approach. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, showcasing the
method's ability to achieve high-quality reconstructions even under constrained
input conditions.

*Longchao Da,Xiangrui Liu,Mithun Shivakoti,Thirulogasankar Pranav Kutralingam,Yezhou Yang,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DeepShade, a diffusion-based model for synthesizing shade variations, and a dataset for training, aiming to improve shade-aware routing systems for heatwave conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatwaves threaten public health, but current routing systems lack shade information due to noisy satellite imagery and limited training data.

Method: 1) Build a dataset using Blender-based 3D simulations for shadows. 2) Propose DeepShade, a diffusion model combining RGB and Canny edge layers with contrastive learning.

Result: DeepShade improves shade image generation, demonstrated by calculating shade ratios for route planning in Tempe, Arizona.

Conclusion: The work aids urban planning in extreme heat and has practical applications for public health and the environment.

Abstract: Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global
warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail
to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades
directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training
data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through
two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse
longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different
urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building
outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles
throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are
aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade
patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to
learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of
edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and
incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of
shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,
time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in
generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using
our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning
in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a
reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential
practical applications in the environment.

TL;DR: Med-OoD improves biomedical segmentation by using Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data supervision without external data, feature regularization, or extra annotations, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical segmentation networks often misclassify pixels due to limited and imperfect datasets. OoD data, effective in other tasks, is leveraged to address this.

Method: Proposes Med-OoD, a data-centric framework integrating OoD supervision into fully-supervised segmentation without architectural changes or additional requirements.

Result: Med-OoD reduces pixel misclassification and improves performance on the Lizard dataset. A surprising 76.1% mIoU was achieved using only OoD data.

Conclusion: Med-OoD offers a novel learning paradigm, highlighting the potential of OoD data in medical segmentation, encouraging further exploration.

Abstract: Biomedical segmentation networks easily suffer from the unexpected
misclassification between foreground and background objects when learning on
limited and imperfect medical datasets. Inspired by the strong power of
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) data on other visual tasks, we propose a data-centric
framework, Med-OoD to address this issue by introducing OoD data supervision
into fully-supervised biomedical segmentation with none of the following needs:
(i) external data sources, (ii) feature regularization objectives, (iii)
additional annotations. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into
segmentation networks without any modification on the architectures. Extensive
experiments show that Med-OoD largely prevents various segmentation networks
from the pixel misclassification on medical images and achieves considerable
performance improvements on Lizard dataset. We also present an emerging
learning paradigm of training a medical segmentation network completely using
OoD data devoid of foreground class labels, surprisingly turning out 76.1% mIoU
as test result. We hope this learning paradigm will attract people to rethink
the roles of OoD data. Code is made available at

*Sunpill Kim,Seunghun Paik,Chanwoo Hwang,Minsu Kim,Jae Hong Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for generating adversarial faces that impersonate target identities in face recognition systems (FRSs) by leveraging structural characteristics of the FRS feature space, achieving high success with minimal queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks on FRSs threaten security and privacy, especially in identity verification. Current methods rely on iterative optimization or transferability, which are inefficient or impractical.

Method: Utilizes attributed subspheres in the FRS feature space (e.g., gender or race) to generate adversarial faces with minimal non-adaptive queries (100 images).

Result: Achieves a 93% success rate against AWS's CompareFaces API with just one query, outperforming iterative methods.

Conclusion: The method is efficient, non-adaptive, and capable of producing adversarial faces with chosen attributes, offering a practical attack strategy against commercial FRSs.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security
and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity
verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating
adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet
recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based
approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method
leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure
out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an
attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both
non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the
need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which
have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs
are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting
of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against
AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many
existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately
produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting
high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Motivation: Existing methods for dynamic driving scene reconstruction suffer from inconsistency, deformation, and inefficiency when deviating from input trajectories.

Method: LidarPainter uses a one-step diffusion model to recover consistent driving views from sparse LiDAR data and corrupted renderings in real-time.

Result: LidarPainter is 7x faster than StreetCrafter, uses 1/5 GPU memory, and supports stylized generation via text prompts.

Conclusion: LidarPainter enables efficient, high-quality, and versatile driving scene reconstruction, advancing applications in digital twin systems and autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is of great importance in fields like
digital twin system and autonomous driving simulation. However, unacceptable
degradation occurs when the view deviates from the input trajectory, leading to
corrupted background and vehicle models. To improve reconstruction quality on
novel trajectory, existing methods are subject to various limitations including
inconsistency, deformation, and time consumption. This paper proposes
LidarPainter, a one-step diffusion model that recovers consistent driving views
from sparse LiDAR condition and artifact-corrupted renderings in real-time,
enabling high-fidelity lane shifts in driving scene reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that LidarPainter outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
speed, quality and resource efficiency, specifically 7 x faster than
StreetCrafter with only one fifth of GPU memory required. LidarPainter also
supports stylized generation using text prompts such as "foggy" and "night",
allowing for a diverse expansion of the existing asset library.

Motivation: To enhance spatial understanding and object grounding in complex indoor environments by leveraging hierarchical representations and open-vocabulary models.

Method: Uses a 3D hierarchical scene graph derived from RGB-D frames, integrating open-vocabulary models and a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.

Result: Demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust object grounding, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: OVIGo-3DHSG shows strong potential for applications requiring spatial reasoning in indoor environments.

Abstract: We propose OVIGo-3DHSG method - Open-Vocabulary Indoor Grounding of objects

environment over a Hierarchical Scene Graph derived from sequences of RGB-D
frames utilizing a set of open-vocabulary foundation models and sensor data
processing. The hierarchical representation explicitly models spatial relations
across floors, rooms, locations, and objects. To effectively address complex
queries involving spatial reference to other objects, we integrate the
hierarchical scene graph with a Large Language Model for multistep reasoning.
This integration leverages inter-layer (e.g., room-to-object) and intra-layer
(e.g., object-to-object) connections, enhancing spatial contextual
understanding. We investigate the semantic and geometry accuracy of
hierarchical representation on Habitat Matterport 3D Semantic multi-floor
scenes. Our approach demonstrates efficient scene comprehension and robust
object grounding compared to existing methods. Overall OVIGo-3DHSG demonstrates
strong potential for applications requiring spatial reasoning and understanding

*Yi-Kuan Hsieh,Jun-Wei Hsieh,Xin Li,Yu-Ming Chang,Yu-Chee Tseng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BSPF-ViT introduces block-based symmetric pruning and fusion to jointly optimize Q/K token pruning in ViTs, improving accuracy and reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ViT pruning methods degrade performance by independently pruning Q/K tokens and ignoring token interactions.

Method: BSPF-ViT evaluates tokens and neighbors jointly, compresses retained tokens via similarity fusion, and leverages symmetric attention for efficient pruning.

Result: BSPF-ViT boosts ImageNet accuracy by 1.3-2.0% and reduces computation by 50%, achieving 40% speedup with better accuracy.

Conclusion: BSPF-ViT outperforms state-of-the-art ViTs by balancing accuracy and efficiency through joint token pruning and fusion.

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has achieved impressive results across various
vision tasks, yet its high computational cost limits practical applications.
Recent methods have aimed to reduce ViT's $O(n^2)$ complexity by pruning
unimportant tokens. However, these techniques often sacrifice accuracy by
independently pruning query (Q) and key (K) tokens, leading to performance
degradation due to overlooked token interactions. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel {\bf Block-based Symmetric Pruning and Fusion} for
efficient ViT (BSPF-ViT) that optimizes the pruning of Q/K tokens jointly.
Unlike previous methods that consider only a single direction, our approach
evaluates each token and its neighbors to decide which tokens to retain by
taking token interaction into account. The retained tokens are compressed
through a similarity fusion step, preserving key information while reducing
computational costs. The shared weights of Q/K tokens create a symmetric
attention matrix, allowing pruning only the upper triangular part for speed up.
BSPF-ViT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art ViT methods at all pruning
levels, increasing ImageNet classification accuracy by 1.3% on DeiT-T and 2.0%
on DeiT-S, while reducing computational overhead by 50%. It achieves 40%
speedup with improved accuracy across various ViTs.

*Junyu Lou,Xiaorui Zhao,Kexuan Shi,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BPAM, a framework combining bilateral grids and MLPs for image enhancement, overcoming limitations of linear transformations and global MLP parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited to linear transformations or globally shared MLP parameters, hindering complex color modeling and localized variations.

Method: BPAM integrates bilateral grids with MLPs, dynamically generating pixel-specific MLP parameters via spatial and intensity data, and uses grid decomposition for efficient parameter storage.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining real-time processing.

Conclusion: BPAM effectively addresses dual challenges of non-linear mapping and localized variations, offering superior image enhancement.

Abstract: Deep learning-based bilateral grid processing has emerged as a promising
solution for image enhancement, inherently encoding spatial and intensity
information while enabling efficient full-resolution processing through slicing
operations. However, existing approaches are limited to linear affine
transformations, hindering their ability to model complex color relationships.
Meanwhile, while multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) excel at non-linear mappings,
traditional MLP-based methods employ globally shared parameters, which is hard
to deal with localized variations. To overcome these dual challenges, we
propose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)
framework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with
the non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids
containing MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique
transformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on
spatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid
decomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types
stored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract
category-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective
utilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter
generation. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities.

TL;DR: AD-GS is a self-supervised framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes, eliminating costly manual annotations by using a novel motion model and pseudo 2D segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for dynamic urban driving scenes rely on expensive manual annotations or suffer from inaccuracies in self-supervised approaches, leading to rendering artifacts.

Method: AD-GS integrates a learnable motion model (B-spline curves and trigonometric functions) and pseudo 2D segmentation to represent objects with dynamic Gaussians and temporal masks, enhanced by visibility reasoning and rigid regularization.

Result: AD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art annotation-free methods and competes with annotation-dependent approaches in rendering quality.

Conclusion: AD-GS provides a robust, annotation-free solution for dynamic scene rendering, advancing self-supervised methods in self-driving simulation.

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for
self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly
manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to
capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly,
resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised
framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a
single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates
locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions,
enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring
comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into
objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing
objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks.
Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid
regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that
our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent
approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a principled, data-driven approach for modeling a neural prior

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces TGDA, a training framework for fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) that eliminates reliance on pretrained models, enabling task-specific architectures like LRNets and ViTFS. TGDA outperforms pretrained models, especially in low-resolution settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FGIR methods depend on pretrained models, limiting adaptability and task-specific design. The paper aims to demonstrate high-performance FGIR can be achieved without pretraining.

Method: TGDA integrates data-aware augmentation and weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher model using knowledge distillation. It supports task-specific architectures like LRNets and ViTFS.

Result: TGDA matches or surpasses pretrained models on FGIR benchmarks. LRNets improve accuracy by 23% with fewer parameters and data. ViTFS-T matches ViT B-16 performance with 15.3x fewer parameters.

Conclusion: TGDA offers an efficient alternative to pretraining, enabling adaptable and task-specific FGIR systems.

Abstract: Fine-grained image recognition (FGIR) aims to distinguish visually similar
sub-categories within a broader class, such as identifying bird species. While
most existing FGIR methods rely on backbones pretrained on large-scale datasets
like ImageNet, this dependence limits adaptability to resource-constrained
environments and hinders the development of task-specific architectures
tailored to the unique challenges of FGIR.
  In this work, we challenge the conventional reliance on pretrained models by
demonstrating that high-performance FGIR systems can be trained entirely from
scratch. We introduce a novel training framework, TGDA, that integrates
data-aware augmentation with weak supervision via a fine-grained-aware teacher
model, implemented through knowledge distillation. This framework unlocks the
design of task-specific and hardware-aware architectures, including LRNets for
low-resolution FGIR and ViTFS, a family of Vision Transformers optimized for
efficient inference.
  Extensive experiments across three FGIR benchmarks over diverse settings
involving low-resolution and high-resolution inputs show that our method
consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art pretrained counterparts. In
particular, in the low-resolution setting, LRNets trained with TGDA improve
accuracy by up to 23\% over prior methods while requiring up to 20.6x less
parameters, lower FLOPs, and significantly less training data. Similarly,
ViTFS-T can match the performance of a ViT B-16 pretrained on ImageNet-21k
while using 15.3x fewer trainable parameters and requiring orders of magnitudes
less data. These results highlight TGDA's potential as an adaptable alternative
to pretraining, paving the way for more efficient fine-grained vision systems.

*Zahid Ullah,Dragan Pamucar,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel double ensembling framework combining pre-trained DL models and fine-tuned ML classifiers improves brain tumor classification accuracy in MRI scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human evaluation of MRI scans for tumors can be error-prone due to fatigue, limited expertise, or image quality. This study aims to enhance diagnostic precision.

Method: The approach involves preprocessing, augmentation, transfer learning with pre-trained DL models for feature extraction, and fine-tuning ML classifiers.

Result: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with hyperparameter fine-tuning significantly boosting performance.

Conclusion: The double ensembling framework effectively improves brain tumor classification accuracy, validated by ablation studies.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as the most reliable
tool for detecting tumors due to its capability to produce detailed images that
reveal their presence. However, the accuracy of diagnosis can be compromised
when human specialists evaluate these images. Factors such as fatigue, limited
expertise, and insufficient image detail can lead to errors. For example, small
tumors might go unnoticed, or overlap with healthy brain regions could result
in misidentification. To address these challenges and enhance diagnostic
precision, this study proposes a novel double ensembling framework, consisting
of ensembled pre-trained deep learning (DL) models for feature extraction and
ensembled fine-tuned hyperparameter machine learning (ML) models to efficiently
classify brain tumors. Specifically, our method includes extensive
preprocessing and augmentation, transfer learning concepts by utilizing various
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks and vision transformer networks
to extract deep features from brain MRI, and fine-tune hyperparameters of ML
classifiers. Our experiments utilized three different publicly available Kaggle
MRI brain tumor datasets to evaluate the pre-trained DL feature extractor
models, ML classifiers, and the effectiveness of an ensemble of deep features
along with an ensemble of ML classifiers for brain tumor classification. Our
results indicate that the proposed feature fusion and classifier fusion improve
upon the state of the art, with hyperparameter fine-tuning providing a
significant enhancement over the ensemble method. Additionally, we present an
ablation study to illustrate how each component contributes to accurate brain
tumor classification.

### [58] [Wavelet-based Decoupling Framework for low-light Stereo Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12188)
*Shuangli Du,Siming Yan,Zhenghao Shi,Zhenzhen You,Lu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a wavelet-based method for enhancing low-light stereo images by decoupling feature spaces into low-frequency (illumination) and high-frequency (texture) branches, improving performance over entangled approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods encode all degradation factors in a single latent space, leading to entangled features and shortcut learning. The paper aims to address this by decoupling feature spaces.

Method: Uses wavelet transform to split features into low-frequency (for illumination) and high-frequency (for texture) branches. Introduces HF-CIM for cross-view interaction in high-frequency branches and DTEM for texture enhancement.

Result: Significant advantages in light adjustment and high-frequency recovery, validated on real and synthetic images.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively decouples feature spaces, improving low-light stereo image enhancement.

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement
methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This
leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making
the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper
proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature
space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet
transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and
high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by
adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through
multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature
space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and
multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo
low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to
improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided
cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency
branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting
valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the
high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is
proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset
consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform
illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate
that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while
effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unique challenges of preserving India's culturally rich monuments by integrating modern digitized methods while maintaining authenticity.

Method: Proposes Fractal Convolution for architectural pattern segmentation, SSTF with MosaicSlice data augmentation for terracotta temples, and Super Resolution for high-quality image upscaling.

Result: The methods enable detailed, cost-effective preservation with automation, balancing tradition and innovation.

Conclusion: The study advances cultural heritage protection with efficient, high-quality solutions, ensuring aesthetic excellence and authenticity.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and
restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into
multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and
computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D
reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and
image processing with the integration of computer scientists into
multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in
recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for
their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal
Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that
successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable
cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling
(SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura
Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice
on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy
to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods
allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles
while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within
affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that
preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study
improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic
excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance
the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while
carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

*Yiqi Tian,Pengfei Jin,Mingze Yuan,Na Li,Bo Zeng,Quanzheng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RODS, a new diffusion sampler, uses optimization-inspired methods to detect and correct hallucinations in diffusion models, improving fidelity and robustness without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from hallucinations due to score approximation inaccuracies, prompting the need for a robust sampling method.

Method: RODS leverages geometric cues from the loss landscape to detect and correct high-risk steps, ensuring smoother sampling trajectories and adaptive perturbation adjustments.

Result: RODS detects over 70% of hallucinations and corrects more than 25%, enhancing fidelity and robustness on datasets like AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands.

Conclusion: RODS effectively mitigates hallucinations in diffusion models without retraining or introducing new artifacts, offering a practical solution for improved sampling.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative
modeling, yet their sampling procedures remain vulnerable to hallucinations,
often stemming from inaccuracies in score approximation. In this work, we
reinterpret diffusion sampling through the lens of optimization and introduce
RODS (Robust Optimization-inspired Diffusion Sampler), a novel method that
detects and corrects high-risk sampling steps using geometric cues from the
loss landscape. RODS enforces smoother sampling trajectories and adaptively
adjusts perturbations, reducing hallucinations without retraining and at
minimal additional inference cost. Experiments on AFHQv2, FFHQ, and 11k-hands
demonstrate that RODS improves both sampling fidelity and robustness, detecting
over 70% of hallucinated samples and correcting more than 25%, all while
avoiding the introduction of new artifacts.

*Tao Chen,Jingyi Zhang,Decheng Liu,Chunlei Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces DD-VQA+, an extended VQA dataset with richer attributes, and MGFFD-VLM, a novel forgery detection framework using hybrid LoRA and multi-granularity prompt learning to enhance VLMs for deepfake detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs for deepfake detection lack face quality-related attributes and effective training strategies, limiting their performance and interpretability.

Method: Extends VQA dataset (DD-VQA+), introduces MGFFD-VLM with Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy, Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning, and Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. Uses auxiliary losses for performance.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in forgery judgment and analysis compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances VLMs for deepfake detection, improving both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: Recent studies have utilized visual large language models (VLMs) to answer
not only "Is this face a forgery?" but also "Why is the face a forgery?" These
studies introduced forgery-related attributes, such as forgery location and
type, to construct deepfake VQA datasets and train VLMs, achieving high
accuracy while providing human-understandable explanatory text descriptions.
However, these methods still have limitations. For example, they do not fully
leverage face quality-related attributes, which are often abnormal in forged
faces, and they lack effective training strategies for forgery-aware VLMs. In
this paper, we extend the VQA dataset to create DD-VQA+, which features a
richer set of attributes and a more diverse range of samples. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel forgery detection framework, MGFFD-VLM, which integrates an
Attribute-Driven Hybrid LoRA Strategy to enhance the capabilities of Visual
Large Language Models (VLMs). Additionally, our framework incorporates
Multi-Granularity Prompt Learning and a Forgery-Aware Training Strategy. By
transforming classification and forgery segmentation results into prompts, our
method not only improves forgery classification but also enhances
interpretability. To further boost detection performance, we design multiple
forgery-related auxiliary losses. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach surpasses existing methods in both text-based forgery judgment and
analysis, achieving superior accuracy.

### [62] [Generate to Ground: Multimodal Text Conditioning Boosts Phrase Grounding in Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12236)
*Felix Nützel,Mischa Dombrowski,Bernhard Kainz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative text-to-image diffusion models outperform discriminative methods for zero-shot phrase grounding in medical imaging, especially when fine-tuned with domain-specific language models. A novel post-processing technique, Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM), further enhances accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disease localization in medical imaging by leveraging generative models for phrase grounding, which is currently dominated by discriminative methods.

Method: Uses generative text-to-image diffusion models with cross-attention maps, fine-tuned with a domain-specific language model (CXR-BERT). Introduces BBM for post-processing to align text and image biases.

Result: Achieves double the mIoU scores of current discriminative methods, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Generative models are more effective for phrase grounding in medical imaging, offering robust and interpretable solutions for clinical applications.

Abstract: Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image
regions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical
imaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely
on discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that
generative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can
achieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior
assumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,
domain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms
domain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with
mIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings
highlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding
tasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),
a novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify
regions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even
greater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a
more effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,
paving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical
practice. The source code and model weights are available at

### [63] [Calisthenics Skills Temporal Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12245)
*Antonio Finocchiaro,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset for automating the temporal segmentation of static calisthenics skills in videos, proposing a baseline method with promising but improvable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assist athletes and judges by automating the recognition and duration estimation of static calisthenics skills, a gap not addressed in existing video understanding literature.

Method: Creation of a dataset with annotated temporal segmentation of static calisthenics skills and a baseline approach for skill temporal segmentation.

Result: The baseline method shows feasibility for the problem but indicates room for improvement.

Conclusion: The study lays groundwork for automated tools in calisthenics, demonstrating initial success in skill temporal segmentation.

Abstract: Calisthenics is a fast-growing bodyweight discipline that consists of
different categories, one of which is focused on skills. Skills in calisthenics
encompass both static and dynamic elements performed by athletes. The
evaluation of static skills is based on their difficulty level and the duration
of the hold. Automated tools able to recognize isometric skills from a video by
segmenting them to estimate their duration would be desirable to assist
athletes in their training and judges during competitions. Although the video
understanding literature on action recognition through body pose analysis is
rich, no previous work has specifically addressed the problem of calisthenics
skill temporal video segmentation. This study aims to provide an initial step
towards the implementation of automated tools within the field of Calisthenics.
To advance knowledge in this context, we propose a dataset of video footage of
static calisthenics skills performed by athletes. Each video is annotated with
a temporal segmentation which determines the extent of each skill. We hence
report the results of a baseline approach to address the problem of skill
temporal segmentation on the proposed dataset. The results highlight the
feasibility of the proposed problem, while there is still room for improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning model using chest X-rays predicts moderate/severe BPD in preterm infants with AUROC 0.78, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early BPD prognosis is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low-risk infants, and routine admission radiographs offer a non-invasive tool.

Method: Fine-tuned ResNet-50 pretrained on adult chest radiographs, using progressive layer freezing, CutMix augmentation, and linear probing.

Result: Best model achieved AUROC 0.78, balanced accuracy 0.69, and F1-score 0.67, outperforming ImageNet initialization and traditional IRDS grades.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine radiographs, with potential for site-level and federated learning deployment.

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of
extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks
postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However,
preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental
impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications.
Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to
avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of
extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could
serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and
investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely
low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within
24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult
chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative
learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and
linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing
model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of
0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67
$\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet
initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be
important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited
prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned
markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables
accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive
freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for
site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

*Zixuan Fu,Yan Ren,Finn Carter,Chenyue Wang,Ze Niu,Dacheng Yu,Emily Davis,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FADE is a novel method for erasing specific concepts in text-to-image diffusion models, ensuring privacy and fairness while maintaining model fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address risks of privacy violations and biases in diffusion models by removing sensitive or harmful concepts.

Method: Combines trajectory-aware fine-tuning with an adversarial objective to minimize mutual information between erased concepts and outputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in concept removal and image quality, improving over prior methods by 5-10%.

Conclusion: FADE sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by effectively unlearning specified concepts without full retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable image generation capabilities,
but also pose risks in privacy and fairness by memorizing sensitive concepts or
perpetuating biases. We propose a novel \textbf{concept erasure} method for
text-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a
private individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative
repertoire. Our method, termed \textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion
Erasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial
objective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall
model fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach
minimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's
outputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable
Diffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,
explicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves
state-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like
ESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.
Notably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by
5--10\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to
validate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and
trajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.
Our work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by
unlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.

### [67] [Efficient Calisthenics Skills Classification through Foreground Instance Selection and Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12292)
*Antonio Finocchiaro,Giovanni Maria Farinella,Antonino Furnari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a direct method for calisthenics skill recognition using depth estimation and athlete patch retrieval, avoiding costly pose estimation. It achieves faster inference and higher accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pose estimation methods for calisthenics skill recognition are computationally expensive and slow, limiting real-time and mobile applications.

Method: The approach uses Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and YOLOv10 for athlete localization, segmenting the subject without pose estimation.

Result: The method is 38.3x faster with RGB patches and achieves higher accuracy (0.837 vs. 0.815) with depth patches compared to skeleton-based methods.

Conclusion: The modular pipeline offers efficiency, speed, and accuracy improvements, with potential for future enhancements and real-world adaptability.

Abstract: Calisthenics skill classification is the computer vision task of inferring
the skill performed by an athlete from images, enabling automatic performance
assessment and personalized analytics. Traditional methods for calisthenics
skill recognition are based on pose estimation methods to determine the
position of skeletal data from images, which is later fed to a classification
algorithm to infer the performed skill. Despite the progress in human pose
estimation algorithms, they still involve high computational costs, long
inference times, and complex setups, which limit the applicability of such
approaches in real-time applications or mobile devices. This work proposes a
direct approach to calisthenics skill recognition, which leverages depth
estimation and athlete patch retrieval to avoid the computationally expensive
human pose estimation module. Using Depth Anything V2 for depth estimation and
YOLOv10 for athlete localization, we segment the subject from the background
rather than relying on traditional pose estimation techniques. This strategy
increases efficiency, reduces inference time, and improves classification
accuracy. Our approach significantly outperforms skeleton-based methods,
achieving 38.3x faster inference with RGB image patches and improved
classification accuracy with depth patches (0.837 vs. 0.815). Beyond these
performance gains, the modular design of our pipeline allows for flexible
replacement of components, enabling future enhancements and adaptation to
real-world applications.

*Samuel Lavoie,Michael Noukhovitch,Aaron Courville*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion models' success is largely due to input conditioning. The paper introduces Discrete Latent Code (DLC), a discrete token representation improving fidelity, ease of generation, and compositionality for out-of-distribution samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate and improve the conditioning representations in diffusion models for better sample fidelity, ease of generation, and compositionality.

Method: Introduces Discrete Latent Code (DLC), derived from Simplicial Embeddings with self-supervised learning, and integrates it with diffusion models.

Result: DLCs improve generation fidelity, set a new SOTA for unconditional image generation on ImageNet, and enable coherent out-of-distribution samples and text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: DLCs enhance diffusion models by providing a discrete, compositional representation, enabling better fidelity and novel sample generation.

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is,
for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper
investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the
perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy
to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation.
We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from
Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs
are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image
embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables
sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models
trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally,
we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce
out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in
diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation
by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a
text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples
outside of the image generator training distribution.

TL;DR: KeyDiff3D is an unsupervised framework for monocular 3D keypoints estimation from single images, leveraging a pretrained multi-view diffusion model for supervision and feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require costly manual annotations or multi-view images. KeyDiff3D aims to enable 3D keypoints estimation using only single-view images by exploiting geometric priors from a diffusion model.

Method: The framework uses a pretrained multi-view diffusion model to generate multi-view images from a single image, providing 3D geometric cues. It also extracts 2D multi-view features and constructs 3D feature volumes from the model's intermediate representations.

Result: KeyDiff3D achieves accurate keypoints estimation and enables 3D object manipulation. It performs well on datasets like Human3.6M and Stanford Dogs, demonstrating generalization and effectiveness.

Conclusion: KeyDiff3D offers a cost-effective and accurate solution for monocular 3D keypoints estimation and manipulation, leveraging diffusion models to overcome the limitations of traditional methods.

Abstract: This paper introduces KeyDiff3D, a framework for unsupervised monocular 3D
keypoints estimation that accurately predicts 3D keypoints from a single image.
While previous methods rely on manual annotations or calibrated multi-view
images, both of which are expensive to collect, our method enables monocular 3D
keypoints estimation using only a collection of single-view images. To achieve
this, we leverage powerful geometric priors embedded in a pretrained multi-view
diffusion model. In our framework, this model generates multi-view images from
a single image, serving as a supervision signal to provide 3D geometric cues to
our model. We also use the diffusion model as a powerful 2D multi-view feature
extractor and construct 3D feature volumes from its intermediate
representations. This transforms implicit 3D priors learned by the diffusion
model into explicit 3D features. Beyond accurate keypoints estimation, we
further introduce a pipeline that enables manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model. Experimental results on diverse aspects and datasets,
including Human3.6M, Stanford Dogs, and several in-the-wild and out-of-domain
datasets, highlight the effectiveness of our method in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and its ability to enable manipulation of 3D objects generated
by the diffusion model from a single image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate weed detection is crucial for precision agriculture, but deploying efficient models on resource-limited platforms is challenging, especially for visually similar weed species.

Method: The study uses YOLO11x as a teacher model and YOLO11n as a student, applying CWD and MGD to transfer knowledge. Experiments are conducted on a dataset of sugar beet crops and four weed types.

Result: CWD improves mAP50 by 2.5% and MGD by 1.9% over the baseline. Real-time deployment on Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5 confirms feasibility.

Conclusion: CWD and MGD are effective, efficient, and practical for enhancing weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant phenotyping.

Abstract: Weed detection is a critical component of precision agriculture, facilitating
targeted herbicide application and reducing environmental impact. However,
deploying accurate object detection models on resource-limited platforms
remains challenging, particularly when differentiating visually similar weed
species commonly encountered in plant phenotyping applications. In this work,
we investigate Channel-wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative
Distillation (MGD) to enhance the performance of lightweight models for
real-time smart spraying systems. Utilizing YOLO11x as the teacher model and
YOLO11n as both reference and student, both CWD and MGD effectively transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student model. Our experiments, conducted on
a real-world dataset comprising sugar beet crops and four weed types (Cirsium,
Convolvulus, Fallopia, and Echinochloa), consistently show increased AP50
across all classes. The distilled CWD student model achieves a notable
improvement of 2.5% and MGD achieves 1.9% in mAP50 over the baseline without
increasing model complexity. Additionally, we validate real-time deployment
feasibility by evaluating the student YOLO11n model on Jetson Orin Nano and
Raspberry Pi 5 embedded devices, performing five independent runs to evaluate
performance stability across random seeds. These findings confirm CWD and MGD
as an effective, efficient, and practical approach for improving deep
learning-based weed detection accuracy in precision agriculture and plant
phenotyping scenarios.

Motivation: To enhance unsupervised learning by integrating contrastive learning and clustering for better feature separation and compactness.

Method: Uses two neural networks (query and key) with contrastive loss for separation and clustering for compactness.

Result: Achieves 91.40% (CIFAR-10), 68.56% (CIFAR-100), and 78.65% (ImageNet-100) accuracy.

Conclusion: CueCo advances unsupervised visual representation learning by merging contrastive and clustering methods.

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised
visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of
contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements,
CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations
within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and
a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the
query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features
apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull
together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our
method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on
CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18
backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new
direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel text-driven framework (Text-SemiSeg) enhances semi-supervised medical image segmentation by integrating textual data with visual features, improving accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of labeled data in medical imaging by leveraging textual context for better visual semantic understanding.

Method: Proposes three modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR), Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation (DCA) for text-visual interaction and feature enhancement.

Result: Outperforms other methods on three public datasets by effectively integrating textual information with visual features.

Conclusion: Text-SemiSeg successfully leverages textual data to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is a crucial technique for
alleviating the high cost of data annotation. When labeled data is limited,
textual information can provide additional context to enhance visual semantic
understanding. However, research exploring the use of textual data to enhance
visual semantic embeddings in 3D medical imaging tasks remains scarce. In this
paper, we propose a novel text-driven multiplanar visual interaction framework
for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (termed Text-SemiSeg), which
consists of three main modules: Text-enhanced Multiplanar Representation (TMR),
Category-aware Semantic Alignment (CSA), and Dynamic Cognitive Augmentation
(DCA). Specifically, TMR facilitates text-visual interaction through planar
mapping, thereby enhancing the category awareness of visual features. CSA
performs cross-modal semantic alignment between the text features with
introduced learnable variables and the intermediate layer of visual features.
DCA reduces the distribution discrepancy between labeled and unlabeled data
through their interaction, thus improving the model's robustness. Finally,
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our model effectively
enhances visual features with textual information and outperforms other
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/taozh2017/Text-SemiSeg.

the creation of more reliable surveillance systems for public safety. To this
end, we present two visual object detection benchmarks named OD-VIRAT Large and
OD-VIRAT Tiny, aiming at advancing visual understanding tasks in surveillance
imagery. The video sequences in both benchmarks cover 10 different scenes of
human surveillance recorded from significant height and distance. The proposed
benchmarks offer rich annotations of bounding boxes and categories, where
OD-VIRAT Large has 8.7 million annotated instances in 599,996 images and
OD-VIRAT Tiny has 288,901 annotated instances in 19,860 images. This work also
focuses on benchmarking state-of-the-art object detection architectures,
including RETMDET, YOLOX, RetinaNet, DETR, and Deformable-DETR on this object
detection-specific variant of VIRAT dataset. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first work to examine the performance of these recently published
state-of-the-art object detection architectures on realistic surveillance
imagery under challenging conditions such as complex backgrounds, occluded
objects, and small-scale objects. The proposed benchmarking and experimental
settings will help in providing insights concerning the performance of selected
object detection models and set the base for developing more efficient and
robust object detection architectures.

TL;DR: AutoVDC uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically detect and clean erroneous annotations in autonomous driving datasets, improving data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotations are imperfect and costly to review; automating error detection can enhance dataset reliability.

Method: AutoVDC framework leverages VLMs to identify errors in datasets like KITTI and nuImages, with tests on injected errors and VLM fine-tuning.

Result: High performance in error detection and cleaning, showing potential to improve dataset accuracy.

Conclusion: AutoVDC effectively automates data cleaning, boosting reliability for autonomous driving datasets.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with
precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from
imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality
datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and
expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning)
framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby
enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate
our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object
detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of
AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous
annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally,
we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of
VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high
performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its
potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale
production datasets in autonomous driving.

### [75] [QuRe: Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling in Composed Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12416)
*Jaehyun Kwak,Ramahdani Muhammad Izaaz Inhar,Se-Young Yun,Sung-Ju Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuRe improves Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) by reducing false negatives via a reward model and hard negative sampling, aligning better with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CIR methods ignore the relevance of non-target images due to false negatives in contrastive learning, reducing user satisfaction.

Method: QuRe uses a reward model objective and hard negative sampling to filter false negatives, focusing on images between steep relevance drops.

Result: QuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets and aligns best with human preferences on HP-FashionIQ.

Conclusion: QuRe effectively addresses false negatives in CIR, improving retrieval quality and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference
image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing
CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the
relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods
employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and
all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false
negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user
satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we
propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which
optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we
introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned
between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to
effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their
alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ
(HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond
target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves
state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting
the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset. The

*Haoyuan Liu,Hiroshi Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InterpIoU is a novel loss function for bounding box regression that replaces handcrafted penalties with interpolated boxes, improving small object detection and avoiding box enlargement issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IoU-based losses with geometric penalties are sensitive to box characteristics, leading to suboptimal performance for small objects and misalignment issues.

Method: Proposes InterpIoU, using interpolated boxes to bridge prediction and ground truth, and Dynamic InterpIoU for adaptive interpolation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art IoU-based losses on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC, especially for small objects.

Conclusion: InterpIoU and Dynamic InterpIoU provide more accurate and adaptable bounding box regression, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the
regression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses
often incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's
non-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.
However, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,
often leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired
behaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU
objective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss
function that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the
IoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to
bridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides
meaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box
enlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further
show that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing
geometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,
we introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation
coefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with
diverse object distributions. Experiments on COCO, VisDrone, and PASCAL VOC
show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art IoU-based losses
across various detection frameworks, with particularly notable improvements in
small object detection, confirming their effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVFL-Net is a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network that uses knowledge distillation and spatio-temporal feature modulation to balance performance and efficiency for real-time Human Action Recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers for video recognition are computationally expensive. DVFL-Net aims to reduce computation while maintaining high accuracy by distilling knowledge from a large teacher model to a compact student model.

Method: DVFL-Net employs knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal focal modulation, using forward KL divergence to transfer local and global context from a teacher model (Video-FocalNet Base) to a student model (VFL-Net).

Result: DVFL-Net achieves strong accuracy with lower memory usage and reduced GFLOPs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like UCF101 and Kinetics-400.

Conclusion: DVFL-Net provides an efficient and practical solution for real-time Human Action Recognition, balancing performance and computational cost.

Abstract: The landscape of video recognition has evolved significantly, shifting from
traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Transformer-based
architectures for improved accuracy. While 3D CNNs have been effective at
capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, recent Transformer models leverage
self-attention to model long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Despite
achieving state-of-the-art performance on major benchmarks, Transformers remain
computationally expensive, particularly with dense video data. To address this,
we propose a lightweight Video Focal Modulation Network, DVFL-Net, which
distills spatiotemporal knowledge from a large pre-trained teacher into a
compact nano student model, enabling efficient on-device deployment. DVFL-Net
utilizes knowledge distillation and spatial-temporal feature modulation to
significantly reduce computation while preserving high recognition performance.
We employ forward Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence alongside spatio-temporal
focal modulation to effectively transfer both local and global context from the
Video-FocalNet Base (teacher) to the proposed VFL-Net (student). We evaluate
DVFL-Net on UCF50, UCF101, HMDB51, SSV2, and Kinetics-400, benchmarking it
against recent state-of-the-art methods in Human Action Recognition (HAR).
Additionally, we conduct a detailed ablation study analyzing the impact of
forward KL divergence. The results confirm the superiority of DVFL-Net in
achieving an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, demonstrating
lower memory usage, reduced GFLOPs, and strong accuracy, making it a practical
solution for real-time HAR applications.

Motivation: Current models for pedestrian intention estimation often overlook dynamic traffic signals and contextual scene details, which are vital for real-world autonomous vehicle navigation.

Method: The TA-STGCN integrates traffic signal states (Red, Yellow, Green) and bounding box size as features to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in urban environments.

Result: TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy than the baseline model on the PIE dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed TA-STGCN effectively enhances pedestrian intention prediction by incorporating dynamic traffic signals and scene context, proving its superiority over existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.
However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic
signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world
applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph
Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states
(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach
introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box
size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal
dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing
methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy
compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance VQA performance in text-rich images by utilizing DAM's region-level descriptive capabilities.

Method: Introduces DAM-QA, a framework aggregating answers from multiple regional views for better evidence identification.

Result: Outperforms baseline DAM, with a 7+ point gain on DocVQA, and achieves best performance among region-aware models.

Conclusion: DAM-like models show promise for text-rich VQA when paired with efficient integration strategies.

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling,
particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is
capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or
objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment
supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is
beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in
challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the
fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct
answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored
evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware
capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning
over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that
aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more
effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements.
Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA
also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer
parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These
results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader
VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code

*Shangpin Peng,Senqiao Yang,Li Jiang,Zhuotao Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SENTINEL reduces hallucinations in MLLMs by early intervention at the sentence level using in-domain preference learning, achieving a 90% reduction without human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs persist despite existing methods, often due to high costs or data mismatches. Early-stage intervention is identified as key.

Method: SENTINEL bootstraps preference pairs by validating object existence with detectors, classifies sentences, and trains models with context-aware preference loss (C-DPO).

Result: SENTINEL reduces hallucinations by over 90% and outperforms prior methods on benchmarks.

Conclusion: SENTINEL is a superior, annotation-free framework for mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs, with strong generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have revolutionized cross-modal
understanding but continue to struggle with hallucinations - fabricated content
contradicting visual inputs. Existing hallucination mitigation methods either
incur prohibitive computational costs or introduce distribution mismatches
between training data and model outputs. We identify a critical insight:
hallucinations predominantly emerge at the early stages of text generation and
propagate through subsequent outputs. To address this, we propose **SENTINEL**
(**S**entence-level **E**arly i**N**tervention **T**hrough **IN**-domain
pr**E**ference **L**earning), a framework that eliminates dependency on human
annotations. Specifically, we first bootstrap high-quality in-domain preference
pairs by iteratively sampling model outputs, validating object existence
through cross-checking with two open-vocabulary detectors, and classifying
sentences into hallucinated/non-hallucinated categories. Subsequently, we use
context-coherent positive samples and hallucinated negative samples to build
context-aware preference data iteratively. Finally, we train models using a
context-aware preference loss (C-DPO) that emphasizes discriminative learning
at the sentence level where hallucinations initially manifest. Experimental
results show that SENTINEL can reduce hallucinations by over 90\% compared to
the original model and outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method on both
hallucination benchmarks and general capabilities benchmarks, demonstrating its
superiority and generalization ability. The models, datasets, and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadGazeIntent is a deep learning model that predicts radiologists' diagnostic intent from gaze data, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models fail to capture the intent behind radiologists' gaze fixations, which is crucial for understanding their diagnostic process.

Method: A transformer-based architecture processes temporal and spatial gaze data to model diagnostic intent, using labeled datasets (RadSeq, RadExplore, RadHybrid).

Result: RadGazeIntent predicts radiologists' focus on findings better than baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Conclusion: The model successfully captures radiologists' intent-driven gaze behavior, enhancing understanding of diagnostic processes.

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images.
A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may
be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to
locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models
fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we
introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this
behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it.
Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial
dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into
coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret
radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied
intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets
to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential
Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid
Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict
which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming
baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

components for 3D tracking, our approach unifies the intrinsic connections
between point tracking, monocular depth, and camera pose estimation into a

motion into scene geometry, camera ego-motion, and pixel-wise object motion,
with a fully differentiable and end-to-end architecture, allowing scalable
training across a wide range of datasets, including synthetic sequences, posed

TL;DR: CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder, is applied to hematology for explainable AI in medical imaging, identifying morphologically relevant concepts and aiding in disease detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of tools for explaining inferences in medical imaging foundation models motivates the use of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for interpretability.

Method: CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder, is trained on 40,000+ peripheral blood single-cell images and tested on diverse datasets, including bone marrow cytology.

Result: CytoSAE identifies validated medical concepts, detects disease-specific abnormalities, and performs comparably to state-of-the-art in AML classification.

Conclusion: CytoSAE provides explainable AI for hematology, bridging the gap between foundation models and clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) emerged as a promising tool for mechanistic
interpretability of transformer-based foundation models. Very recently, SAEs
were also adopted for the visual domain, enabling the discovery of visual
concepts and their patch-wise attribution to tokens in the transformer model.
While a growing number of foundation models emerged for medical imaging, tools
for explaining their inferences are still lacking. In this work, we show the
applicability of SAEs for hematology. We propose CytoSAE, a sparse autoencoder
which is trained on over 40,000 peripheral blood single-cell images. CytoSAE
generalizes to diverse and out-of-domain datasets, including bone marrow
cytology, where it identifies morphologically relevant concepts which we
validated with medical experts. Furthermore, we demonstrate scenarios in which
CytoSAE can generate patient-specific and disease-specific concepts, enabling
the detection of pathognomonic cells and localized cellular abnormalities at
the patch level. We quantified the effect of concepts on a patient-level AML
subtype classification task and show that CytoSAE concepts reach performance
comparable to the state-of-the-art, while offering explainability on the
sub-cellular level. Source code and model weights are available at

Motivation: Existing 3D generative models neglect physical properties, limiting real-world applications like simulation and embodied AI.

Method: 1) PhysXNet: A physics-grounded 3D dataset annotated across five dimensions (scale, material, affordance, kinematics, function). 2) PhysXGen: A dual-branch framework injecting physical knowledge into pre-trained 3D structural space.

Result: PhysX demonstrates superior performance and generalization in producing physics-aware 3D assets while preserving geometry quality.

Conclusion: PhysX advances physical-grounded 3D generation, with potential to enhance applications in simulation and AI. Code, data, and models will be released.

Abstract: 3D modeling is moving from virtual to physical. Existing 3D generation
primarily emphasizes geometries and textures while neglecting physical-grounded
modeling. Consequently, despite the rapid development of 3D generative models,
the synthesized 3D assets often overlook rich and important physical
properties, hampering their real-world application in physical domains like
simulation and embodied AI. As an initial attempt to address this challenge, we
propose \textbf{PhysX}, an end-to-end paradigm for physical-grounded 3D asset
generation. 1) To bridge the critical gap in physics-annotated 3D datasets, we
present PhysXNet - the first physics-grounded 3D dataset systematically
annotated across five foundational dimensions: absolute scale, material,
affordance, kinematics, and function description. In particular, we devise a
scalable human-in-the-loop annotation pipeline based on vision-language models,
which enables efficient creation of physics-first assets from raw 3D assets.2)
Furthermore, we propose \textbf{PhysXGen}, a feed-forward framework for
physics-grounded image-to-3D asset generation, injecting physical knowledge
into the pre-trained 3D structural space. Specifically, PhysXGen employs a
dual-branch architecture to explicitly model the latent correlations between 3D
structures and physical properties, thereby producing 3D assets with plausible
physical predictions while preserving the native geometry quality. Extensive
experiments validate the superior performance and promising generalization
capability of our framework. All the code, data, and models will be released to
facilitate future research in generative physical AI.

Conclusion: AI offers a roadmap for sustainable, tech-enabled ecosystems, bridging scientific insight, artistic practice, and environmental care.

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human

that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and
practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for
AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple
reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings

low-barrier, high-diversity testbeds, our framework provides a unified workflow
for analyzing how each module affects performance across dynamic interactive
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the harness lifts gameplay
performance consistently over un-harnessed baselines and reveals distinct
contribution patterns, for example, memory dominates in long-horizon puzzles
while perception is critical in vision noisy arcades. These findings highlight
the effectiveness of our modular harness design in advancing general-purpose
agent, given the familiarity and ubiquity of games in everyday human
experience.

### [89] [Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11662)
*Moises Andrade,Joonhyuk Cha,Brandon Ho,Vriksha Srihari,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MLLMs show promise as verifiers for agent behavior but suffer from agreement bias. Self-Grounded Verification (SGV) improves accuracy by leveraging MLLMs' own reasoning, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending verifiers to domains without clear success criteria (e.g., computer use) is challenging. MLLMs offer potential due to their world knowledge and reasoning skills.

Method: Proposed Self-Grounded Verification (SGV): MLLMs first retrieve broad priors about task completion, then evaluate trajectories conditioned on these priors.

Result: SGV improves MLLM verifiers by up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks.

Conclusion: SGV effectively mitigates agreement bias in MLLMs, enhancing their utility as verifiers in complex domains.

Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key
for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these
gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains
a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this
intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language
Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,
human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as
verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and
robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a
strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often
generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is
pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several
methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs
despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To
address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method
that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing
their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV
operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors
about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,
conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate
trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in
accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of
heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,
a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting
a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

*Chenyu Zhou,Jingyuan Yang,Linwei Xin,Yitian Chen,Ziyan He,Dongdong Ge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DP-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating DP problems, and DPLM, a specialized 7B-parameter model, outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs. DualReflect, a novel data generation pipeline, combines forward and backward generation to enhance training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating DP model formulation using LLMs is challenging due to stochastic transitions and limited training data. Existing LLM frameworks are inadequate for DP problems.

Method: Introduces DP-Bench for evaluation and DPLM, a specialized model. DualReflect generates synthetic data by combining forward (diverse) and backward (reliable) generation.

Result: DPLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art LLMs, especially on hard problems. DualReflect's combined approach proves effective for scaling training data.

Conclusion: Combining forward and backward generation in DualReflect is key for effective DP problem-solving, highlighting their complementary strengths.

Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but
formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the
problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the
potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges
due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of
training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing
LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such
as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark
covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic
evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a
7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on
hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel
synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a
limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for
diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key
insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong
correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such
guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse
formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both
approaches and the importance of combining them.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for batching GPU computations in depth-first search (DFS), extending algorithms like Batch IDA* and Batch BTS, while maintaining optimality. Evaluated on Rubik's Cube and sliding tile puzzles, it shows efficient GPU batching in DFS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage GPU parallel processing to enhance classic search algorithms, addressing the lack of GPU-optimized search methods.

Method: Proposes cost-bounded DFS (CB-DFS) for batching GPU computations, extending algorithms like Batch IDA* and Batch BTS, building on Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*).

Result: Demonstrates efficient GPU batching in DFS on 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding tile puzzle, with analysis of hyperparameters and hardware impact.

Conclusion: GPU batching in DFS is feasible and effective, with potential for broader application in search algorithms.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel
processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search
algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large
pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving
heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to
exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU
computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations
in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded
depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of
modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*},
an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an
extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach
used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality
guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding
tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in
DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of
hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on
performance.

TL;DR: Aime is a dynamic multi-agent framework that outperforms traditional plan-and-execute systems by introducing adaptive planning, on-demand agent creation, and centralized progress management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MAS with LLMs are limited by rigid planning, static capabilities, and poor communication, reducing adaptability in dynamic environments.

Method: Aime uses a Dynamic Planner, Actor Factory for on-demand agents, and a Progress Management Module for real-time coordination.

Result: Aime excels in benchmarks like GAIA, SWE-bench, and WebVoyager, surpassing specialized state-of-the-art agents.

Conclusion: Aime provides a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are
emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems.
However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent
plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan
execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These
weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments.
This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome
these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime
replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive
architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that
continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution
feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation,
assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and
(3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of
truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime
on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software
engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The
results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized
state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability
and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective
foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

*Pranav Rajbhandari,Abhi Veda,Matthew Garratt,Mandayam Srinivasan,Sridhar Ravi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bio-inspired UAV navigation using optic flow, trained via Reinforcement Learning, mimics honeybee behavior by focusing on optic flow discontinuities and large magnitudes for obstacle avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage honeybee navigation strategies (using optic flow) to develop efficient UAV navigation in cluttered environments with limited sensory input.

Method: Train a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow input, then analyze attention patterns.

Result: Agents focus on optic flow discontinuities and large magnitudes, resembling insect behavior, and maintain centered navigation.

Conclusion: This strategy could inform simple control laws for physical UAVs, as it is consistent across independently trained agents.

Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the
capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite
limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly
use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their
visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a
Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only
optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained
agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base
their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most
attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with
large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered
tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while
maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the
behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently
trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for
developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes TPE-MARL, a topology-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning method, to optimize cooperative decision-making for connected and autonomous vehicles in mixed traffic. It compresses traffic state information and reduces search space, achieving superior performance in efficiency, safety, and decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The exponential growth of joint state-action spaces in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exacerbates the exploration-exploitation trade-off, especially in mixed traffic scenarios for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).

Method: The method constructs a game topology tensor to compress traffic state information and reduce search space. It uses QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, incorporating visit counts and agent mutual information.

Result: TPE-MARL balances exploration and exploitation, outperforming in traffic efficiency, safety, decision smoothness, and task completion. It matches or exceeds human driver rationality in mixed and fully autonomous traffic.

Conclusion: TPE-MARL effectively addresses the exploration-exploitation challenge in MARL for CAVs, demonstrating robust performance in diverse traffic scenarios.

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental
challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint
state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)
method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:
First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,
effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease
the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game
topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a
topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual
information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV
penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations
encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic
performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL
successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits
superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision
smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates
decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in
both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. Code of our work is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of online POMDP planning in dynamically evolving environments, where traditional methods suffer from high sampling sparsity and performance loss.

Method: Proposes an anytime online approximate POMDP solver that samples future histories deeply while enforcing gradual policy updates, with theoretical guarantees on bounded performance loss.

Result: Empirical tests on large-scale problems, including a helicopter emergency scenario, show the solver outperforms current online benchmarks.

Conclusion: The solver is effective for complex, dynamic environments, offering improved performance and theoretical robustness.

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a
novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future
histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We
provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say
that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling
approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given
the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two
large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a
helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150
planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our
solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

TL;DR: The paper explores LLMs' limitations in spatial strategic reasoning using Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) and introduces Xiangqi-R1, a specialized model with improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and enhance LLMs' strategic reasoning in complex, fully observable board games like Xiangqi.

Method: Proposes a training framework with a multi-stage approach: fine-tuning for legal moves, strategic annotations, and reinforcement learning (GRPO) with multi-dimensional rewards.

Result: Xiangqi-R1 outperforms general-purpose LLMs with an 18% increase in move legality and 22% boost in analysis accuracy.

Conclusion: Specialized training frameworks can significantly improve LLMs' strategic intelligence in spatially complex domains.

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness
in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully
observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt
Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate
rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such
environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a
large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert
annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning
for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating
strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying
reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our
Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,
general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these
tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an
18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results
point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs act as subjective literary critics, showing varied aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in assessing Japanese sci-fi stories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how LLMs evaluate literature and whether they exhibit individual evaluation traits akin to human critics.

Method: Translated 10 Japanese sci-fi stories, evaluated by 6 LLMs across 7 sessions, analyzed using PCA, clustering, and TF-IDF.

Result: Found significant evaluation variations (α 1.00-0.35), 5 distinct patterns, and 4.5-fold variance in story evaluations.

Conclusion: LLMs display individual evaluation characteristics, resembling human critical schools, not neutral benchmarks.

Abstract: This study positions large language models (LLMs) as "subjective literary
critics" to explore aesthetic preferences and evaluation patterns in literary
assessment. Ten Japanese science fiction short stories were translated into
English and evaluated by six state-of-the-art LLMs across seven independent
sessions. Principal component analysis and clustering techniques revealed
significant variations in evaluation consistency ({\alpha} ranging from 1.00 to
0.35) and five distinct evaluation patterns. Additionally, evaluation variance
across stories differed by up to 4.5-fold, with TF-IDF analysis confirming
distinctive evaluation vocabularies for each model. Our seven-session
within-day protocol using an original Science Fiction corpus strategically
minimizes external biases, allowing us to observe implicit value systems shaped
by RLHF and their influence on literary judgment. These findings suggest that
LLMs may possess individual evaluation characteristics similar to human
critical schools, rather than functioning as neutral benchmarkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Map-VQA research is limited to choropleth maps, lacking diversity in map types and thematic categories. The study aims to address these gaps by expanding the scope of Map-VQA.

Method: The authors created MapIQ, a dataset with 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types and six themes. They evaluated MLLMs on six visual analytical tasks and tested robustness against map design changes.

Result: The study compares MLLM performance against a human baseline and analyzes the impact of design changes, revealing insights into model robustness and reliance on geographic knowledge.

Conclusion: The findings highlight limitations in current MLLMs for Map-VQA and suggest directions for improving their performance and robustness in handling diverse map types and designs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven
researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g.,
bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual
question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily
focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic
categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce
MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three
map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning
topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple
MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against
one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact
of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,
and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and
sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and
potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

TL;DR: PgM is a multimodal learning framework that partitions modal representations into uni-modal and paired-modal features, enhancing learning flexibility and effectiveness across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To thoroughly learn and utilize both uni-modal and paired-modal features in multimodal learning, enabling better adaptability for diverse tasks.

Method: PgM includes a modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder to segment, learn, and reconstruct features.

Result: PgM shows effectiveness in four multimodal tasks and demonstrates transferability to existing models. Feature distributions are visualized for insights.

Conclusion: PgM successfully enhances multimodal learning by partitioning and adjusting features, offering flexibility and improved performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each
learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned
from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from
cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a
partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal
partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal
decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into
uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated
components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder
reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features.
PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and
paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and
paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different
learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further
highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize
the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and
tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

(2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural
language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation,
where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with
feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer;
and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was
computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all
intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final
answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the
explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on
the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We
demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the
door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where
auditing results are critical.

### [105] [CRABS: A syntactic-semantic pincer strategy for bounding LLM interpretation of Python notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11742)
*Meng Li,Timothy M. McPhillips,Dingmin Wang,Shin-Rong Tsai,Bertram Ludäscher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes CRABS, a method combining syntactic analysis and LLMs to understand Python notebooks by generating information flow and execution dependency graphs, achieving high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding Python notebooks is crucial for reuse and adaptation, but re-execution is impractical, and LLMs alone fail due to hallucinations and long-context issues.

Method: CRABS uses shallow syntactic parsing and AST analysis to bound interpretations, then employs an LLM for zero-shot learning to resolve ambiguities in cell I/O.

Result: CRABS achieves 98% F1 for information flow and 99% for execution dependencies, with LLMs resolving 98% of ambiguities.

Conclusion: CRABS effectively combines syntactic analysis and LLMs to accurately understand notebooks, addressing limitations of re-execution and pure LLM approaches.

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and
machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and
adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution
often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software
dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases
have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we
observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to
hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose
a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and
corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to
assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve
Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and
analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct
interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the
inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via
cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and
outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted
Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.
The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the
syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves
average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99%
identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

*Matteo Fasulo,Luca Babboni,Luca Tedeschini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI Wizards' approach to subjectivity detection in news articles, using sentiment-augmented transformers, achieved top performance in CLEF 2025's CheckThat! Lab Task 1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve subjectivity detection in news articles across diverse languages, including zero-shot settings, by integrating sentiment features with transformer models.

Method: Enhanced transformer-based classifiers (mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base, Llama3.2-1B) with sentiment scores, optimized decision thresholds for class imbalance.

Result: Significant performance boost, especially in subjective F1 scores; ranked 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

Conclusion: Sentiment-augmented transformers effectively improve subjectivity detection, demonstrating strong generalization across languages.

Abstract: This paper presents AI Wizards' participation in the CLEF 2025 CheckThat! Lab
Task 1: Subjectivity Detection in News Articles, classifying sentences as
subjective/objective in monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings.
Training/development datasets were provided for Arabic, German, English,
Italian, and Bulgarian; final evaluation included additional unseen languages
(e.g., Greek, Romanian, Polish, Ukrainian) to assess generalization. Our
primary strategy enhanced transformer-based classifiers by integrating
sentiment scores, derived from an auxiliary model, with sentence
representations, aiming to improve upon standard fine-tuning. We explored this
sentiment-augmented architecture with mDeBERTaV3-base, ModernBERT-base
(English), and Llama3.2-1B. To address class imbalance, prevalent across
languages, we employed decision threshold calibration optimized on the
development set. Our experiments show sentiment feature integration
significantly boosts performance, especially subjective F1 score. This
framework led to high rankings, notably 1st for Greek (Macro F1 = 0.51).

*Dante Campregher,Yanxu Chen,Sander Hoffman,Maria Heuss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reproduces studies on how LLMs handle factual vs. counterfactual info, focusing on attention heads. Findings suggest factual promotion via general copy suppression, not selective counterfactual suppression, and domain-dependent attention patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile conflicting findings from prior studies on how LLMs manage competing factual and counterfactual information, particularly the role of attention heads.

Method: Reproduces and analyzes three recent studies using Mechanistic Interpretability tools, examining attention head strength, suppression mechanisms, and domain specificity.

Result: Attention heads promote factual output via general copy suppression, not selective counterfactual suppression, and their behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models showing more specialized patterns.

Conclusion: Attention heads' role in factual output is generalized and domain-specific, challenging prior hypotheses about selective suppression mechanisms.

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language
Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing
on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and
reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and
Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between
model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic
Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship
between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing
hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the
domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that
attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression
rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can
also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior
is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and
category-sensitive patterns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A dataset of 230K sentences in English and 22 Indian languages is released, along with robust baseline models for language identification, addressing challenges in noisy, short, and code-mixed environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language identification is critical for NLP applications but is challenging for Indian languages due to lexical, phonetic similarities, and shared scripts.

Method: A dataset is created and labeled, and baseline models using machine learning and deep learning approaches are developed.

Result: The baseline models perform comparably to state-of-the-art models for language identification.

Conclusion: The released dataset and models advance research in language identification for diverse Indian languages.

Abstract: The language identification task is a crucial fundamental step in NLP. Often
it serves as a pre-processing step for widely used NLP applications such as
multilingual machine translation, information retrieval, question and
answering, and text summarization. The core challenge of language
identification lies in distinguishing languages in noisy, short, and code-mixed
environments. This becomes even harder in case of diverse Indian languages that
exhibit lexical and phonetic similarities, but have distinct differences. Many
Indian languages share the same script making the task even more challenging.
In this paper, we release a dataset of 230K sentences consisting of English and
all 22 official Indian languages labeled with their language identifiers where
data in most languages are newly created. We also develop and release robust
baseline models using state-of-the-art approaches in machine learning and deep
learning that can aid the research in this field. Our baseline models are
comparable to the state-of-the-art models for the language identification task.

*Mohammad Samragh,Arnav Kundu,David Harrison,Kumari Nishu,Devang Naik,Minsik Cho,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework for autoregressive language models enables simultaneous prediction of multiple tokens, improving speed without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the sequential constraint of autoregressive models to enhance inference speed and parallelism.

Method: Uses masked-input formulation, gated LoRA, a learnable sampler, auxiliary losses, and speculative generation for multi-token prediction.

Result: Achieves 5x faster code/math generation and 2.5x speedup in chat/knowledge tasks without quality loss.

Conclusion: The framework successfully accelerates autoregressive models while maintaining output quality.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are constrained by their inherently sequential
nature, generating one token at a time. This paradigm limits inference speed
and parallelism, especially during later stages of generation when the
direction and semantics of text are relatively certain. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that leverages the inherent knowledge of vanilla
autoregressive language models about future tokens, combining techniques to
realize this potential and enable simultaneous prediction of multiple
subsequent tokens. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a
masked-input formulation where multiple future tokens are jointly predicted
from a common prefix; (2) a gated LoRA formulation that preserves the original
LLM's functionality, while equipping it for multi-token prediction; (3) a
lightweight, learnable sampler module that generates coherent sequences from
the predicted future tokens; (4) a set of auxiliary training losses, including
a consistency loss, to enhance the coherence and accuracy of jointly generated
tokens; and (5) a speculative generation strategy that expands tokens
quadratically in the future while maintaining high fidelity. Our method
achieves significant speedups through supervised fine-tuning on pretrained
models. For example, it generates code and math nearly 5x faster, and improves
general chat and knowledge tasks by almost 2.5x. These gains come without any
loss in quality.

TL;DR: The paper explores cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient learning for PII recognition, evaluating performance across healthcare, legal, and biography domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automated text anonymization by understanding the effectiveness of cross-domain transfer, data fusion, and few-shot learning for PII recognition.

Method: Evaluated models using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2), legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia) across in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and few-shot learning.

Result: Legal-domain data transfers well to biographical texts, medical domains resist incoming transfer, fusion benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

Conclusion: Cross-domain transfer and few-shot learning are viable for PII recognition, but effectiveness varies by domain, with legal data showing strong transferability and medical data being less adaptable.

Abstract: Accurate recognition of personally identifiable information (PII) is central
to automated text anonymization. This paper investigates the effectiveness of
cross-domain model transfer, multi-domain data fusion, and sample-efficient
learning for PII recognition. Using annotated corpora from healthcare (I2B2),
legal (TAB), and biography (Wikipedia), we evaluate models across four
dimensions: in-domain performance, cross-domain transferability, fusion, and
few-shot learning. Results show legal-domain data transfers well to
biographical texts, while medical domains resist incoming transfer. Fusion
benefits are domain-specific, and high-quality recognition is achievable with
only 10% of training data in low-specialization domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between GEC and COLA tasks by leveraging shared grammatical knowledge for mutual improvement.

Method: Augments COLA models with GEC datasets and integrates grammatical acceptability signals into GEC training via a dynamic loss function.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multilingual benchmarks, with identified challenges in punctuation error correction.

Conclusion: COLA-GEC successfully improves both tasks, though future work is needed to address remaining challenges like punctuation errors.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) and grammatical acceptability judgment
(COLA) are core tasks in natural language processing, sharing foundational
grammatical knowledge yet typically evolving independently. This paper
introduces COLA-GEC, a novel bidirectional framework that enhances both tasks
through mutual knowledge transfer. First, we augment grammatical acceptability
models using GEC datasets, significantly improving their performance across
multiple languages. Second, we integrate grammatical acceptability signals into
GEC model training via a dynamic loss function, effectively guiding corrections
toward grammatically acceptable outputs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
results on several multilingual benchmarks. Comprehensive error analysis
highlights remaining challenges, particularly in punctuation error correction,
providing insights for future improvements in grammatical modeling.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DualReward is a reinforcement learning framework for generating distractors in cloze tests, using adaptive dual rewards to outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve distractor generation in cloze tests by dynamically balancing human-created examples and model-generated candidates.

Method: Employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling, adjusting rewards based on model performance and confidence.

Result: Shows consistent improvements, especially on diverse datasets (3.48-3.86% P@1 gain).

Conclusion: DualReward effectively balances learning from human examples and exploring novel distractors for automated test generation.

Abstract: This paper introduces DualReward, a novel reinforcement learning framework
for automatic distractor generation in cloze tests. Unlike conventional
approaches that rely primarily on supervised learning or static generative
models, our method employs a dual reward structure with adaptive scaling that
differentiates between human-created gold standard distractors and
model-generated candidates. The framework dynamically adjusts reward signal
intensity based on model performance and confidence. We evaluate our approach
on both passage-level (CLOTH-F) and sentence-level (MCQ) cloze test datasets,
demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results show that our adaptive reward scaling mechanism provides
modest but consistent benefits on homogeneous datasets (CLOTH-F) and more
substantial improvements (3.48-3.86% in P@1) on diverse, cross-domain data
(MCQ), suggesting its particular effectiveness for handling varied question
types and domains. Our work offers a flexible framework that effectively
balances learning from reliable human examples while exploring novel,
high-quality distractors for automated test generation.

### [113] [LLMs Encode Harmfulness and Refusal Separately](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11878)
*Jiachen Zhao,Jing Huang,Zhengxuan Wu,David Bau,Weiyan Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a distinct 'harmfulness direction' in LLMs, separate from refusal, and shows how steering along it can alter model behavior. It introduces 'Latent Guard' as a robust safety mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand if LLMs truly grasp harmfulness beyond refusal and to explore their internal safety mechanisms.

Method: Analyzes harmfulness and refusal as separate dimensions, tests steering effects, and evaluates jailbreak methods and adversarial finetuning.

Result: Harmfulness is encoded separately from refusal; Latent Guard performs comparably to dedicated safeguard models.

Conclusion: LLMs' internal harmfulness understanding is robust, offering new insights for AI safety.

Abstract: LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand
harmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal
behaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal
direction. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety
mechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a
separate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is
distinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the
harmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as
harmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal
responses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.
Furthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain
jailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially
finetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the
model's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical
safety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as
an intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing
over-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent
Guard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a
dedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our
findings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more
robust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a
new perspective to study AI safety

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Marco-Bench-MIF, a localized multilingual extension of IFEval, covering 30 languages to address limitations of monolingual or machine-translated datasets. It highlights performance gaps, model scale impacts, and underestimation by machine-translated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing instruction-following datasets for LLMs are either monolingual (English-focused) or machine-translated, limiting multilingual applicability. This work aims to provide a localized benchmark for diverse languages.

Method: A hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification was used to create Marco-Bench-MIF, addressing linguistic and cultural constraints. The benchmark evaluates 20+ LLMs across 30 languages.

Result: Key findings include a 25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, 45-60% performance impact from model scale, and 7-22% underestimation by machine-translated data. Challenges like keyword consistency and constraint adherence were identified.

Conclusion: Marco-Bench-MIF addresses multilingual instruction-following challenges, revealing significant gaps and biases in LLM performance. The benchmark is publicly available for further research.

Abstract: Instruction-following capability has become a major ability to be evaluated
for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing datasets, such as IFEval,
are either predominantly monolingual and centered on English or simply machine
translated to other languages, limiting their applicability in multilingual
contexts. In this paper, we present an carefully-curated extension of IFEval to
a localized multilingual version named Marco-Bench-MIF, covering 30 languages
with varying levels of localization. Our benchmark addresses linguistic
constraints (e.g., modifying capitalization requirements for Chinese) and
cultural references (e.g., substituting region-specific company names in
prompts) via a hybrid pipeline combining translation with verification. Through
comprehensive evaluation of 20+ LLMs on our Marco-Bench-MIF, we found that: (1)
25-35% accuracy gap between high/low-resource languages, (2) model scales
largely impact performance by 45-60% yet persists script-specific challenges,
and (3) machine-translated data underestimates accuracy by7-22% versus
localized data. Our analysis identifies challenges in multilingual instruction
following, including keyword consistency preservation and compositional
constraint adherence across languages. Our Marco-Bench-MIF is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart understanding benchmarks are mostly English-centric, limiting global accessibility. PolyChartQA aims to bridge this gap by supporting multilingual evaluation.

Method: A decoupled pipeline separates chart data from rendering code, enabling multilingual chart generation via translation. State-of-the-art LLM-based translation and quality control ensure consistency.

Result: Experiments show a performance gap between English and other languages, especially low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts.

Conclusion: PolyChartQA provides a foundation for inclusive vision-language models, highlighting the need for better multilingual support in chart understanding.

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating
data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly
English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global
audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale
multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and
26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is
built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code,
allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the
data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation
and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic
and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA
facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding.
Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal
a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially
low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for
advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tokenization methods are CPU-bound and inefficient for GPU batch inference, limiting performance in large language model pipelines.

Method: BlockBPE eliminates Regex pre-tokenization, enabling parallelized token merges within GPU thread blocks, reducing complexity to O(nd).

Result: BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over HuggingFace Tokenizers in high-batch workloads.

Conclusion: BlockBPE offers a scalable, efficient solution for GPU-accelerated tokenization, improving throughput for batch inference.

Abstract: Tokenization is a critical preprocessing step in large language model
pipelines, yet widely-used implementations remain CPU-bound and suboptimal for
batch inference workflows on GPU. We present BlockBPE, a parallel GPU
implementation of byte-pair encoding (BPE) that achieves near linear-time
complexity under realistic assumptions and is optimized for high-throughput,
batch inference. Unlike existing Rust-based tokenizers such as HuggingFace
Tokenizers or OpenAI's tiktoken-whose runtimes are dominated by Regex
pre-tokenization and exhibit $O(n \log n)$ runtime-BlockBPE eliminates the
Regex pre-tokenization which leads to small loss in generation quality, but
enables highly parallelized token merges within thread blocks, reducing overall
complexity to $O(nd)$ where $d \ll n$. On high-batch inference workloads,
BlockBPE achieves up to 2x higher throughput than tiktoken and 2.5x over
HuggingFace Tokenizers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces DAC, a dynamic attention-aware method for task-agnostic prompt compression, addressing overlooked aspects like attention-critical tokens and entropy shifts, and demonstrates its effectiveness across diverse tasks and LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt compression methods focus on information entropy but neglect attention-critical tokens and entropy shifts, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes DAC, integrating entropy and attention information dynamically to sense entropy shifts for fine-grained compression.

Result: DAC shows robust improvements across tasks (LongBench, GSM8K, BBH) and LLMs, proving its efficacy.

Conclusion: DAC effectively addresses limitations of existing methods, offering superior performance in task-agnostic prompt compression.

Abstract: Task-agnostic prompt compression leverages the redundancy in natural language
to reduce computational overhead and enhance information density within
prompts, especially in long-context scenarios. Existing methods predominantly
rely on information entropy as the metric to compress lexical units, aiming to
achieve minimal information loss. However, these approaches overlook two
critical aspects: (i) the importance of attention-critical tokens at the
algorithmic level, and (ii) shifts in information entropy during the
compression process. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a dynamic
attention-aware approach for task-agnostic prompt compression (DAC). This
approach effectively integrates entropy and attention information, dynamically
sensing entropy shifts during compression to achieve fine-grained prompt
compression. Extensive experiments across various domains, including LongBench,
GSM8K, and BBH, show that DAC consistently yields robust and substantial
improvements across a diverse range of tasks and LLMs, offering compelling
evidence of its efficacy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the IAM framework to optimize LLM efficiency by leveraging attention matrix similarity between small and large models, achieving faster computation and reduced KV cache usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high resource consumption of LLMs, especially with long contexts, by exploiting external information (attention matrix similarity) for optimization.

Method: IAM framework measures attention matrix similarity, selects mapping layers, and ensures consistency to map attention between small and large LLMs.

Result: IAM accelerates prefill by 15%, reduces KV cache usage by 22.1%, and maintains performance, showing generalizability across model series.

Conclusion: IAM is a versatile and orthogonal addition to existing methods for enhancing LLM efficiency.

Abstract: LLMs encounter significant challenges in resource consumption nowadays,
especially with long contexts. Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing
inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within
the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We
identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs,
which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a
comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping
Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we
introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated
attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention
mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that
IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without
appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models
show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many
existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the
current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency.

direct answers. We explore multi-stage query-based framework for WikiData QA,
proposing multi-stage approach that enhances performance on challenging
multi-hop and temporal benchmarks. Through generalization and rejection
studies, we evaluate robustness across multi-hop and temporal QA datasets.
Additionally, we introduce a novel entity linking and predicate matching method
using CoT reasoning. Our results demonstrate the potential of query-based
multi-stage KGQA framework for improving multi-hop and temporal QA with small

*Xinyu Wang,Vahid Partovi Nia,Peng Lu,Jerry Huang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Power-of-two (PoT) quantization framework for LLMs improves accuracy in low-precision formats and speeds up dequantization on GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of PoT quantization on GPUs and the high computational cost of deploying LLMs.

Method: Introduces a two-step post-training algorithm: robust scale initialization and refinement using a minimal calibration set.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in 2- and 3-bit formats and achieves significant speedups (3.67× on V100, 1.63× on RTX 4090).

Conclusion: The proposed PoT quantization enhances LLM deployment efficiency by improving accuracy and speeding up inference on GPUs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is
challenging due to the substantial computational resources required.
Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this
difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently
dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on
GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit
manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization
framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in
extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference
through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the
quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)
initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)
refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT
post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer
quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our
PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating
point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and
$1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

### [122] [Toxicity-Aware Few-Shot Prompting for Low-Resource Singlish Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11966)
*Ziyu Ge,Gabriel Chua,Leanne Tan,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A two-stage framework for toxicity-preserving translation in low-resource languages, demonstrated on Singlish, combining human-verified few-shot prompts and model optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard translation systems fail to handle slang, code-mixing, and toxicity in under-represented languages, necessitating a culturally sensitive approach.

Method: 1. Human-verified few-shot prompt engineering to capture slang and toxicity. 2. Model-prompt optimization using semantic similarity benchmarks.

Result: Quantitative human evaluation confirms the pipeline's effectiveness in preserving toxicity and improving translation quality.

Conclusion: The framework enhances multicultural LLM safety and underscores the need for sociolinguistic nuance in applications like content moderation.

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages
and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve
local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech.
Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional
challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize
offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage
framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed
Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt
engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target
examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize
model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic
similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation
confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving
translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural
LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in
low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP,
we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world
applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

*Yuhong Zhang,Jialu Li,Shilai Yang,Yuchen Xu,Gert Cauwenberghs,Tzyy-Ping Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares human and LLM reading comprehension using graph-based text representation and eye-tracking, showing LLMs' consistency in understanding language structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of human and LLM language comprehension beyond individual words, using graph-based analysis for richer insights.

Method: Used an LLM-based AI agent to group words into nodes and edges, forming a semantic graph, and compared eye fixation patterns on these structures.

Result: LLMs showed high consistency in understanding language at the graph topological level, validated by eye-tracking data.

Conclusion: The findings advance human-AI co-learning strategies by highlighting LLMs' structural comprehension strengths.

Abstract: Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development.
With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need
to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts
and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion
interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and
human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed
that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the
inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns,
particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely
on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the
conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This
study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into
nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic
meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye
fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit
high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological
structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into
effective human-AI co-learning strategies.

### [124] [Value-Based Large Language Model Agent Simulation for Mutual Evaluation of Trust and Interpersonal Closeness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11979)
*Yuki Sakamoto,Takahisa Uchida,Hiroshi Ishiguro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study explores how value similarity affects trust and closeness among LLM agents, confirming its positive impact and validating LLM simulations for social science research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether value similarity, a key factor in human relationships, applies to artificial societies of LLM agents.

Method: Conducted two experiments: first to control values in LLMs, then to analyze trust and closeness in agent pairs with varying value similarity.

Result: Agents with higher value similarity showed greater mutual trust and interpersonal closeness.

Conclusion: LLM simulations are effective for testing social science theories and understanding value-driven relationship dynamics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for simulating
complex social phenomena using human-like agents with specific traits. In human
societies, value similarity is important for building trust and close
relationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true
in artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study
investigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among
LLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we
evaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective
model and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main
experiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and
analyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness
following a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to
investigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents
with higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal
closeness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a
valid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the
mechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a
foundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.

*Lukas Ellinger,Miriam Anschütz,Georg Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Simplification of homonym definitions in LLMs risks information loss and misunderstanding, especially for children and language learners. Fine-tuning models like Llama 3.1 8B improves quality, but balancing simplicity and completeness is crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how simplification affects the quality of homonym definitions for different target groups (Normal, Simple, ELI5) and ensure reliable, context-aware outputs.

Method: Evaluated models (DeepSeek v3, Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, Llama 3.1 8B) using LLM-as-Judge and human annotations on multilingual datasets. Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: Simplification degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing misunderstanding risk. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B improved homonym response quality across all prompts.

Conclusion: Balancing simplicity and completeness in educational NLP is essential to provide reliable definitions for diverse learners.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accurate word definitions and
explanations for any context. However, the scope of the definition changes for
different target groups, like children or language learners. This is especially
relevant for homonyms, words with multiple meanings, where oversimplification
might risk information loss by omitting key senses, potentially misleading
users who trust LLM outputs. We investigate how simplification impacts homonym
definition quality across three target groups: Normal, Simple, and ELI5. Using
two novel evaluation datasets spanning multiple languages, we test DeepSeek v3,
Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen3-30B A3B, GPT-4o mini, and Llama 3.1 8B via LLM-as-Judge
and human annotations. Our results show that simplification drastically
degrades definition completeness by neglecting polysemy, increasing the risk of
misunderstanding. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B with Direct Preference Optimization
substantially improves homonym response quality across all prompt types. These
findings highlight the need to balance simplicity and completeness in
educational NLP to ensure reliable, context-aware definitions for all learners.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The thesis improves data and parameter efficiency in neural language models through representation analysis, optimization techniques, and weak supervision, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data and parameter efficiency, enhance robustness, and reduce reliance on labeled data in neural language models.

Method: Analyzes language representations, introduces smoothness-based regularization, integrates active learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and enhances weak supervision via in-context learning.

Result: Outperforms traditional methods in performance, stability, and efficiency, with gains in accuracy and robustness, especially in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Combining representation smoothness, active learning, and weak supervision significantly improves model efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in
neural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the
introduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the
properties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,
emphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It
proposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including
regularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to
stabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second
part focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency
by integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,
guided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents
smoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need
for labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active
learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and
computational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP
tasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform
traditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The
third part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning
to effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive
labeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak
supervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by
leveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive
empirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,
adaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic
data environments.

*Anca Dinu,Andra-Maria Florescu,Alina Resceanu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A linguistic creativity test for humans and LLMs showed LLMs outperforming humans in originality, elaboration, and flexibility, with minor differences in answer uniqueness and creativity styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and compare linguistic creativity between humans and LLMs using word formation and metaphorical language tasks.

Method: Administered a test to 24 humans and 24 LLMs, evaluating answers automatically (OCSAI tool) for originality, elaboration, and flexibility, followed by uniqueness and manual analysis.

Result: LLMs outperformed humans in all criteria and most tasks, with humans showing E-creativity and LLMs favoring F-creativity.

Conclusion: LLMs excel in linguistic creativity tasks, but humans and LLMs exhibit distinct creativity styles.

Abstract: The following paper introduces a general linguistic creativity test for
humans and Large Language Models (LLMs). The test consists of various tasks
aimed at assessing their ability to generate new original words and phrases
based on word formation processes (derivation and compounding) and on
metaphorical language use. We administered the test to 24 humans and to an
equal number of LLMs, and we automatically evaluated their answers using OCSAI
tool for three criteria: Originality, Elaboration, and Flexibility. The results
show that LLMs not only outperformed humans in all the assessed criteria, but
did better in six out of the eight test tasks. We then computed the uniqueness
of the individual answers, which showed some minor differences between humans
and LLMs. Finally, we performed a short manual analysis of the dataset, which
revealed that humans are more inclined towards E(extending)-creativity, while
LLMs favor F(ixed)-creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates 28 LLMs on their ability to reason about cardinal directions using a templated benchmark, finding even newer models struggle with accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and compare the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly newer models, in determining cardinal directions under varied scenarios.

Method: A benchmark generated from templates with variations (e.g., locomotion, perspective) was used to test 28 LLMs.

Result: Even advanced Large Reasoning Models failed to reliably determine correct cardinal directions in all tested scenarios.

Conclusion: Current LLMs, including newer models, lack robust reasoning for cardinal directions, highlighting a limitation in their spatial reasoning abilities.

Abstract: We investigate the abilities of 28 Large language Models (LLMs) to reason
about cardinal directions (CDs) using a benchmark generated from a set of
templates, extensively testing an LLM's ability to determine the correct CD
given a particular scenario. The templates allow for a number of degrees of
variation such as means of locomotion of the agent involved, and whether set in
the first, second or third person. Even the newer Large Reasoning Models are
unable to reliably determine the correct CD for all questions. This paper
summarises and extends earlier work presented at COSIT-24.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a binary AI detection method that is computationally inexpensive and explainable, leveraging large-scale training data.

Method: Uses spaCy for preprocessing (tokenization, NER, parsing, POS tagging) and feature extraction, followed by LightGBM classification. Explores parameter tuning for improved performance.

Result: Trained on a large corpus of 500K machine-generated texts, achieving effective binary AI detection with explainable results.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, computationally efficient, and explainable, aligning with prior non-neural methods.

Abstract: This submission to the binary AI detection task is based on a modular
stylometric pipeline, where: public spaCy models are used for text
preprocessing (including tokenisation, named entity recognition, dependency
parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and morphology annotation) and extracting
several thousand features (frequencies of n-grams of the above linguistic
annotations); light-gradient boosting machines are used as the classifier. We
collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the
classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the
classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach
follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach
found effective previously.

*Giuliano Martinelli,Tommaso Bonomo,Pere-Lluís Huguet Cabot,Roberto Navigli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces BOOKCOREF, the first book-scale coreference benchmark, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks for long texts. It presents an automatic annotation pipeline and shows significant performance improvements (+20 CoNLL-F1) for long-document systems, while highlighting challenges at book scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coreference benchmarks are limited to small- to medium-scale documents, failing to assess performance on long texts like books. This gap hinders the evaluation of systems for large-scale coreference resolution.

Method: The authors develop an automatic pipeline for high-quality coreference annotations on full narrative texts and use it to create BOOKCOREF, a benchmark with documents averaging over 200,000 tokens.

Result: Experiments show the robustness of the pipeline and a +20 CoNLL-F1 improvement for long-document systems. However, current models underperform on book-scale texts compared to smaller documents.

Conclusion: BOOKCOREF fills a critical gap in coreference resolution evaluation for long texts, enabling research and development of book-scale systems. The benchmark and code are publicly released.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks
containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long
texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length
and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when
co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap,
we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality
Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this
pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with
an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series
of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and
demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document
coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full
books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this
unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to
deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our
data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale
Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces MEGA, a method combining Socratic questioning, CoT reasoning, gamification, and formative feedback via LLMs to improve Maths learning. It outperforms traditional CoT, especially in difficult problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many students struggle with Maths due to poor pedagogy, leading to avoidance of Math-related fields. The study aims to improve learning through innovative methods.

Method: MEGA combines Socratic method, CoT reasoning, gamification, and formative feedback using LLMs. It was tested against traditional CoT on GSM8K and MATH datasets with 60 samples.

Result: MEGA was preferred by students over CoT, showing a 47.5% approval rate vs. 26.67% for CoT in the challenging MATH dataset.

Conclusion: MEGA is more effective for explaining difficult Maths problems, suggesting its potential to enhance Maths pedagogy.

Abstract: This paper presents an intervention study on the effects of the combined
methods of (1) the Socratic method, (2) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning, (3)
simplified gamification and (4) formative feedback on university students'
Maths learning driven by large language models (LLMs). We call our approach
Mathematics Explanations through Games by AI LLMs (MEGA). Some students
struggle with Maths and as a result avoid Math-related discipline or subjects
despite the importance of Maths across many fields, including signal
processing. Oftentimes, students' Maths difficulties stem from suboptimal
pedagogy. We compared the MEGA method to the traditional step-by-step (CoT)
method to ascertain which is better by using a within-group design after
randomly assigning questions for the participants, who are university students.
Samples (n=60) were randomly drawn from each of the two test sets of the Grade
School Math 8K (GSM8K) and Mathematics Aptitude Test of Heuristics (MATH)
datasets, based on the error margin of 11%, the confidence level of 90%, and a
manageable number of samples for the student evaluators. These samples were
used to evaluate two capable LLMs at length (Generative Pretrained Transformer
4o (GPT4o) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) out of the initial six that were tested for
capability. The results showed that students agree in more instances that the
MEGA method is experienced as better for learning for both datasets. It is even
much better than the CoT (47.5% compared to 26.67%) in the more difficult MATH
dataset, indicating that MEGA is better at explaining difficult Maths problems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for evaluating LLM-based text augmentation, focusing on scalability and iterative refinement, showing GPT-3.5 Turbo's superior performance and practical benefits in topic modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of semantic preservation in existing text augmentation techniques, especially in low-resource NLP settings.

Method: Proposes a framework with Scalability Analysis and Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR) to evaluate semantic consistency and drift.

Result: GPT-3.5 Turbo outperforms in semantic fidelity, diversity, and efficiency, and boosts topic granularity by 400% in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively evaluates LLM-based augmentation, proving its utility in enhancing NLP pipelines.

Abstract: Text data augmentation is a widely used strategy for mitigating data sparsity
in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in low-resource settings
where limited samples hinder effective semantic modeling. While augmentation
can improve input diversity and downstream interpretability, existing
techniques often lack mechanisms to ensure semantic preservation during
large-scale or iterative generation, leading to redundancy and instability.
This work introduces a principled evaluation framework for large language model
(LLM) based text augmentation, comprising two components: (1) Scalability
Analysis, which measures semantic consistency as augmentation volume increases,
and (2) Iterative Augmentation with Summarization Refinement (IASR), which
evaluates semantic drift across recursive paraphrasing cycles. Empirical
evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs show that GPT-3.5 Turbo achieved the
best balance of semantic fidelity, diversity, and generation efficiency.
Applied to a real-world topic modeling task using BERTopic with GPT-enhanced
few-shot labeling, the proposed approach results in a 400% increase in topic
granularity and complete elimination of topic overlaps. These findings
validated the utility of the proposed frameworks for structured evaluation of
LLM-based augmentation in practical NLP pipelines.

*Pavel Šindelář,Ondřej Bojar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ELOQUENT's Sensemaking task evaluates generative models through question creation, answering, and scoring, revealing challenges in question quality assessment, answer restriction, and evaluation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well generative models make sense of given texts by mimicking classroom exam processes.

Method: Three-step process: (1) Teacher systems create questions, (2) Student systems answer them, (3) Evaluator systems score answers, using diverse multilingual test materials.

Result: Observations include difficulty in evaluating question quality, acceptable LLM performance in answering (with input text restriction issues), and flawed LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

Conclusion: Sensemaking highlights the need for better evaluation strategies for question creation and improved methods to ensure answer adherence to input texts and accurate scoring.

Abstract: ELOQUENT is a set of shared tasks that aims to create easily testable
high-level criteria for evaluating generative language models. Sensemaking is
one such shared task.
  In Sensemaking, we try to assess how well generative models ``make sense out
of a given text'' in three steps inspired by exams in a classroom setting: (1)
Teacher systems should prepare a set of questions, (2) Student systems should
answer these questions, and (3) Evaluator systems should score these answers,
all adhering rather strictly to a given set of input materials.
  We report on the 2025 edition of Sensemaking, where we had 7 sources of test
materials (fact-checking analyses of statements, textbooks, transcribed
recordings of a lecture, and educational videos) spanning English, German,
Ukrainian, and Czech languages.
  This year, 4 teams participated, providing us with 2 Teacher submissions, 2
Student submissions, and 2 Evaluator submissions. We added baselines for
Teacher and Student using commercial large language model systems. We devised a
fully automatic evaluation procedure, which we compare to a minimalistic manual
evaluation.
  We were able to make some interesting observations. For the first task, the
creation of questions, better evaluation strategies will still have to be
devised because it is difficult to discern the quality of the various candidate
question sets. In the second task, question answering, the LLMs examined
overall perform acceptably, but restricting their answers to the given input
texts remains problematic. In the third task, evaluation of question answers,
our adversarial tests reveal that systems using the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm
erroneously rate both garbled question-answer pairs and answers to mixed-up
questions as acceptable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) to model translation behavior, linking physical actions (eye/finger movements) to cognitive and affective processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how observable translation behavior (e.g., keystrokes, gaze) reflects hidden cognitive and affective states during translation.

Method: Analyze keystroke and gaze data to map behavioral patterns into a hierarchical BTSS, used to simulate translation dynamics.

Result: A multi-layered BTSS framework that captures the interplay of affect, cognition, and behavior in translation.

Conclusion: The BTSS provides a computational model for simulating human translation processes, bridging physical actions and mental states.

Abstract: The paper introduces a Behavioural Translation Style Space (BTSS) that
describes possible behavioural translation patterns. The suggested BTSS is
organized as a hierarchical structure that entails various embedded processing
layers. We posit that observable translation behaviour - i.e., eye and finger
movements - is fundamental when executing the physical act of translation but
it is caused and shaped by higher-order cognitive processes and affective
translation states. We analyse records of keystrokes and gaze data as
indicators of the hidden mental processing structure and organize the
behavioural patterns as a multi-layered embedded BTSS. The BTSS serves as the
basis for a computational translation agent to simulate the temporal dynamics
of affect, automatized behaviour and cognition during human translation
production.

TL;DR: An ASR-free method for word reading assessment in low-resource settings using few-shot SSL model comparisons, showing limitations with child speech.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess word reading in low-resource settings without relying on ASR, leveraging SSL models for few-shot learning.

Method: Compares child speech to adult reference templates using SSL model encodings, experimenting with discretisation and barycentre averaging.

Result: Reasonable performance for adults but significant drop for child speech, even with child templates.

Conclusion: SSL representations have limitations for child speech in few-shot systems, despite success in low-resource tasks.

Abstract: We explore an ASR-free method for isolated word reading assessment in
low-resource settings. Our few-shot approach compares input child speech to a
small set of adult-provided reference templates. Inputs and templates are
encoded using intermediate layers from large self-supervised learned (SSL)
models. Using an Afrikaans child speech benchmark, we investigate design
options such as discretising SSL features and barycentre averaging of the
templates. Idealised experiments show reasonable performance for adults, but a
substantial drop for child speech input, even with child templates. Despite the
success of employing SSL representations in low-resource speech tasks, our work
highlights the limitations of SSL representations for processing child data
when used in a few-shot classification system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end ASR models struggle with contextually relevant keywords like proper nouns or user-specific entities, despite their general speech transcription performance.

Method: Proposes a multi-grained fusion approach that integrates token-level and phrase-level fusion with LLMs, using a late-fusion strategy to combine acoustic and contextual information.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics in Chinese and English datasets without compromising non-keyword accuracy.

Conclusion: The joint framework of token-level and phrase-level fusion significantly enhances keyword recognition, with both components contributing to performance gains.

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown
impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to
accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or
user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the
textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level
fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that
enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own
limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly
leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large
Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines
ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing
fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while
preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level
components both contribute significantly to the performance gains,
complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

*Yikang Liu,Wanyang Zhang,Yiming Wang,Jialong Tang,Pei Zhang,Baosong Yang,Fei Huang,Rui Wang,Hai Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the T-index, a quantitative measure for translationese, using contrastively fine-tuned LMs. It shows robustness and efficiency, correlating well with human judgments and differing from existing MT QE metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a generalizable and graded measure of translationese, addressing gaps in existing metrics.

Method: Uses likelihood ratios from two fine-tuned LMs (0.5B parameters) on synthetic and real-world translation data. Evaluates cross-domain generalizability and human judgment validity.

Result: T-index effectively captures translationese, correlates with human annotations (Pearson's r = 0.568), and differs from BLEU/COMET metrics.

Conclusion: T-index is a robust, efficient, and complementary metric for MT quality estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first quantitative measure for translationese
-- the translationese-index (T-index) for graded and generalizable measurement
of translationese, computed from the likelihood ratios of two contrastively
fine-tuned language models (LMs). We use a synthesized dataset and a dataset
with translations in the wild to evaluate T-index's generalizability in
cross-domain settings and its validity against human judgments. Our results
show that T-index is both robust and efficient. T-index scored by two 0.5B LMs
fine-tuned on only 1-5k pairs of synthetic data can well capture translationese
in the wild. We find that the relative differences in T-indices between
translations can well predict pairwise translationese annotations obtained from
human annotators; and the absolute values of T-indices correlate well with
human ratings of degrees of translationese (Pearson's $r = 0.568$).
Additionally, the correlation between T-index and existing machine translation
(MT) quality estimation (QE) metrics such as BLEU and COMET is low, suggesting
that T-index is not covered by these metrics and can serve as a complementary
metric in MT QE.

*Johann Frei,Nils Feldhus,Lisa Raithel,Roland Roller,Alexander Meyer,Frank Kramer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Infherno, an end-to-end framework using LLM agents and healthcare tools, improves translation of clinical notes into structured FHIR resources, outperforming modular systems and matching human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for translating clinical notes into FHIR resources lack generalizability and structural conformity, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: The framework employs LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology databases to ensure adherence to FHIR schema and improve accuracy.

Result: Infherno competes with human baseline performance in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text and supports clinical data integration.

Conclusion: The proposed solution enhances interoperability and data integration, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard
has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between
complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from
free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular,
rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding.
Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural
inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code
execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues.
Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document
schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources
from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and
synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data
integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

### [139] [Text-ADBench: Text Anomaly Detection Benchmark based on LLMs Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12295)
*Feng Xiao,Jicong Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, evaluating embedding-based methods across diverse models and datasets, revealing that embedding quality is key and deep learning doesn't outperform shallow methods with LLM embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of standardized benchmarks for text anomaly detection limits rigorous comparison and innovation in the field.

Method: The study evaluates embedding-based anomaly detection using early and modern language models (e.g., BERT, LLaMa-2) across multi-domain datasets with metrics like AUROC and AUPRC.

Result: Embedding quality is crucial for performance; deep learning methods show no advantage over shallow ones with LLM embeddings. Cross-model performance matrices exhibit low-rank traits, aiding efficient model selection.

Conclusion: The benchmark toolkit, open-sourced, provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing
(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation
identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant
advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the
absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the
existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and
development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive
empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,
leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide
array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of
embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language
models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI
(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,
scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).
Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality
significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based
approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow
algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived
embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in
cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid
model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical
applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes
all embeddings from different models and code at
https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work
provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly
detection systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for VHDL tasks, finds them lacking, and proposes Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes) to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's limited research on LLMs for hardware description languages like VHDL, despite their potential in EDA tasks.

Method: Evaluates LLMs on VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform datasets, then introduces CoDes, a method using intermediate descriptive steps to enhance LLM performance.

Result: LLMs underperform for VHDL tasks, but CoDes significantly outperforms standard prompting.

Conclusion: CoDes improves VHDL code generation and summarization, offering a framework for future LLM enhancements in this domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks
and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm
of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,
despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a
dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware
description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization
using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,
an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally
equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these
models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their
suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose
Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of
LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves
generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem
statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These
steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or
code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our
experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the
standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This
method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization
but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs
for VHDL.

*Liu He,Yuanchao Li,Rui Feng,XinRan Han,Yin-Long Liu,Yuwei Yang,Zude Zhu,Jiahong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study identifies gender bias in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech perception, with male speech more often labeled as AD, especially in Chinese. Acoustic features like shimmer and speech portion correlate with AD perception. Language had no significant impact, but gender bias is critical for AD detection models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate gender bias in AD speech perception, given known voicing differences between genders, and its implications for AD detection models.

Method: Conducted a perception experiment with 16 Chinese listeners evaluating Chinese and Greek speech, followed by acoustic analysis of features like shimmer and speech portion.

Result: Male speech was more frequently identified as AD, particularly in Chinese. Shimmer values in male speech correlated with AD perception, while speech portion negatively correlated. Language did not significantly affect perception.

Conclusion: Gender bias significantly impacts AD speech perception, emphasizing the need to address it in AD detection models and further validate models across languages.

Abstract: Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced
by the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a
gender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a
perception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese
and Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified
as AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic
analysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly
associated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant
negative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a
significant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role
of gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of
addressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for
further research to validate model performance across different linguistic
contexts.

*Ana Davila,Jacinto Colan,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a multi-agent debate framework to improve LLMs' ability to handle ambiguous user requests, showing enhanced performance for specific models like Mistral-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges like ambiguity in LLM-processed user requests by leveraging collaborative debate among models.

Method: Uses a debate framework with three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, Mistral-7B) and a diverse ambiguity dataset.

Result: Mistral-7B-led debates achieved a 76.7% success rate, improving clarity and consensus for complex ambiguities.

Conclusion: The debate framework effectively enhances LLM capabilities, offering insights for robust language understanding systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
understanding and generating human language, contributing to more natural
interactions with complex systems. However, they face challenges such as
ambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this
paper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to
enhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The
framework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and
Mistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate
framework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B
variants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving
a notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex
ambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model
responses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate
framework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This
work offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language
understanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved
clarity in interactive systems.

*Meysam Alizadeh,Fabrizio Gilardi,Zeynab Samei,Mohsen Mosleh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs with web browsing can predict social media user demographics from usernames, revealing biases and misuse risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to retrieve and analyze social media data, focusing on demographic inference from usernames.

Method: Evaluated on synthetic Twitter accounts (48) and survey data (1,384 participants) to assess accuracy and biases.

Result: LLMs can predict demographics but exhibit biases, especially for inactive accounts.

Conclusion: Recommends restricting public access to this capability while allowing controlled research use to mitigate risks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have traditionally relied on static training
data, limiting their knowledge to fixed snapshots. Recent advancements,
however, have equipped LLMs with web browsing capabilities, enabling real time
information retrieval and multi step reasoning over live web content. While
prior studies have demonstrated LLMs ability to access and analyze websites,
their capacity to directly retrieve and analyze social media data remains
unexplored. Here, we evaluate whether web browsing LLMs can infer demographic
attributes of social media users given only their usernames. Using a synthetic
dataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international
participants, we show that these models can access social media content and
predict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic
dataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,
which may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal
activity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science
in the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information
operations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards. We
recommend that LLM providers restrict this capability in public facing
applications, while preserving controlled access for verified research
purposes.

*Yucheng Sun,Alessandro Stolfo,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probes on internal activations in language models can detect arithmetic errors with high accuracy, generalize to complex tasks, and improve model self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if internal model activations can identify arithmetic errors and enable lightweight self-correction.

Method: Use probes on hidden states for 3-digit addition, train error detectors, and test on GSM8K problems with selective re-prompting.

Result: Probes achieve over 90% accuracy in detecting errors and improve task accuracy via selective re-prompting.

Conclusion: Internal activations can anticipate arithmetic errors, and simple probes enable effective model self-correction.

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to
detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit
addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's
predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of
whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight
error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then
extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only
GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize
well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal
representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective
re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal
disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can
be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a
viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

*Chandana Cheerla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An advanced RAG framework improves enterprise data processing by combining hybrid retrieval, metadata filtering, and semantic chunking, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLMs and conventional RAG in handling structured/semi-structured enterprise data.

Method: Hybrid retrieval (dense embeddings + BM25), metadata-aware filtering, semantic chunking, quantized indexing, and human-in-the-loop feedback.

Result: Precision@5 (+15%), Recall@5 (+13%), Mean Reciprocal Rank (+16%), and higher qualitative scores in Faithfulness, Completeness, and Relevance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances accuracy and relevance for enterprise tasks, with future plans for multimodal and agent-based extensions.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR
records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical
decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative
capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,
and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but
often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval
strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by
metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The
framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains
tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing
optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and
conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5
increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),
and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative
evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness
(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.
These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,
comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future
work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based
retrieval. The source code will be released at

*Yik Siu Chan,Zheng-Xin Yong,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using chain-of-thought (CoT) activations to predict misalignment in model responses, finding that linear probes on CoT activations outperform text-based methods and enable early safety monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address alignment risks in open-weights reasoning models by predicting harmful content in final responses using CoTs.

Method: Evaluated monitoring approaches (humans, LLMs, text classifiers) using CoT text or activations, focusing on linear probes for CoT activations.

Result: Linear probes on CoT activations outperformed text-based methods, providing reliable predictions early in reasoning.

Conclusion: Lightweight probes on CoT activations can enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during model generation.

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs)
before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces
additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the
CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to
predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring
approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text
classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple
linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all
text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or
unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers,
while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive
signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning
completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT
segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety
benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety
monitoring and early intervention during generation.

TL;DR: S2WTM, a new topic model, uses hyperspherical latent space and Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to avoid posterior collapse, outperforming existing models in topic coherence and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE-NTMs with hyperspherical latent space often suffer from posterior collapse, leading to ineffective representations.

Method: Proposes S2WTM, using a hyperspherical prior and Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align posterior and prior distributions.

Result: S2WTM generates more coherent and diverse topics and improves downstream task performance.

Conclusion: S2WTM effectively mitigates posterior collapse and enhances topic modeling performance.

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven
effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data,
benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models
(VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical
structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL
divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to
ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling
hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced
Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior
distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical
Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with
the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms
state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics
while improving performance on downstream tasks.

TL;DR: BETR, a benchmark-targeted ranking method, improves model performance by aligning pretraining data with evaluation benchmarks, achieving a 2.1x compute efficiency gain and better task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper explores the impact of explicitly optimizing data selection for benchmarks, which is often done implicitly in practice.

Method: BETR selects pretraining documents by embedding benchmark examples and pretraining data in a shared space, scoring similarity, and training a classifier to predict scores for the full corpus.

Result: BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over baselines, improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks, and generalizes well to diverse benchmarks. Larger models require less aggressive filtering.

Conclusion: Directly matching pretraining data to target tasks shapes model capabilities effectively, and optimal data selection must adapt to model scale.

Abstract: Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these
targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers
develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then
refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make
this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted
ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on
similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a
sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by
similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these
scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over
500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to
them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation
benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline
(4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks
across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of
benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms
baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models
require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly
matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities
and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new graph neural network model (RUGNN) is developed for accurate 3D deformation predictions in material forming, outperforming traditional AI models and baseline GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI-based surrogate models struggle with 3D spatial relationships and permutation invariance, limiting their effectiveness in material forming predictions.

Method: The RUGNN model uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) for temporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph mechanism for spatial dependencies, along with a novel 'node-to-surface' contact method.

Result: RUGNN accurately predicts deformation fields in cold and hot forming case studies, matching ground truth FE simulations and outperforming baseline GNNs.

Conclusion: RUGNN is a reliable tool for manufacturability predictions in sheet material forming, offering computational efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: In recent years, various artificial intelligence-based surrogate models have
been proposed to provide rapid manufacturability predictions of material
forming processes. However, traditional AI-based surrogate models, typically
built with scalar or image-based neural networks, are limited in their ability
to capture complex 3D spatial relationships and to operate in a
permutation-invariant manner. To overcome these issues, emerging graph-based
surrogate models are developed using graph neural networks. This study
developed a new graph neural network surrogate model named Recurrent U
Net-based Graph Neural Network (RUGNN). The RUGNN model can achieve accurate
predictions of sheet material deformation fields across multiple forming
timesteps. The RUGNN model incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model
temporal dynamics and a U-Net inspired graph-based downsample/upsample
mechanism to handle spatial long-range dependencies. A novel 'node-to-surface'
contact representation method was proposed, offering significant improvements
in computational efficiency for large-scale contact interactions. The RUGNN
model was validated using a cold forming case study and a more complex hot
forming case study using aluminium alloys. Results demonstrate that the RUGNN
model provides accurate deformation predictions closely matching ground truth
FE simulations and outperforming several baseline GNN architectures. Model
tuning was also performed to identify suitable hyperparameters, training
strategies, and input feature representations. These results demonstrate that
RUGNN is a reliable approach to support sheet material forming design by
enabling accurate manufacturability predictions.

TL;DR: SurgeryLSTM, a masked BiLSTM with attention, outperforms traditional ML models in predicting LOS in elective spine surgery, offering higher accuracy (R2=0.86) and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve LOS prediction in elective spine surgery by leveraging temporal modeling and enhancing model interpretability for clinical adoption.

Method: Compared traditional ML models (linear regression, random forest, SVM, XGBoost) with SurgeryLSTM using EHR data, evaluated via R2, and used explainable AI for key predictors.

Result: SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest R2 (0.86), with attention identifying key temporal segments and predictors like bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion.

Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM is an effective, interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction, supporting its integration into clinical workflows for better patient care.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for
predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the
benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and
Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random
forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,
SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an
attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.
Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key
predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved
the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)
and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by
dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative
clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most
contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone
disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most
impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention
mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential
nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher
accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical

*Kazuma Kobayashi,Shailesh Garg,Farid Ahmed,Souvik Chakraborty,Syed Bahauddin Alam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMCO combines Monte Carlo dropout and split conformal prediction in DeepONet for robust uncertainty quantification in neural operator-based virtual sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reliable uncertainty quantification in deep learning for high-stakes, real-time virtual sensing with sparse or noisy data.

Method: Unifies Monte Carlo dropout and split conformal prediction in a DeepONet architecture to provide calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals without retraining or custom loss design.

Result: Achieves near-nominal empirical coverage across turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and cosmic radiation dose estimation, even with spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing.

Conclusion: CMCO offers a scalable, plug-and-play solution for uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning, enabling trustworthy real-time inference in critical applications.

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe
deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in
high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the
norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework
that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated,
distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with
split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves
spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or
custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow
operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains.
Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow,
elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO
consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with
strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a
general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking
real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and
safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal
computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable,
generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: Einstein Fields is a neural representation for compressing 4D numerical relativity simulations into compact neural network weights, enabling physical quantity derivation via automatic differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational intensity of numerical relativity simulations by leveraging neural networks for compact and efficient modeling of spacetime geometry.

Method: Uses Neural Tensor Fields to encode spacetime geometry, naturally capturing dynamics as a byproduct, and employs automatic differentiation for deriving physical quantities.

Result: Demonstrates potential in continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use.

Conclusion: Einstein Fields offer a scalable and expressive approach to numerical relativity, with an open-source library provided for further development.

Abstract: We introduce Einstein Fields, a neural representation that is designed to
compress computationally intensive four-dimensional numerical relativity
simulations into compact implicit neural network weights. By modeling the
\emph{metric}, which is the core tensor field of general relativity, Einstein
Fields enable the derivation of physical quantities via automatic
differentiation. However, unlike conventional neural fields (e.g., signed
distance, occupancy, or radiance fields), Einstein Fields are \emph{Neural
Tensor Fields} with the key difference that when encoding the spacetime
geometry of general relativity into neural field representations, dynamics
emerge naturally as a byproduct. Einstein Fields show remarkable potential,
including continuum modeling of 4D spacetime, mesh-agnosticity, storage
efficiency, derivative accuracy, and ease of use. We address these challenges
across several canonical test beds of general relativity and release an open
source JAX-based library, paving the way for more scalable and expressive
approaches to numerical relativity. Code is made available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces tensor representations and sparse autoencoders for analyzing irregular event time series, demonstrating effectiveness in X-ray astronomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event time series are unstructured and irregular, making pattern extraction challenging with conventional methods.

Method: Proposes two- and three-dimensional tensor representations coupled with sparse autoencoders for learning latent representations.

Result: The method captures temporal and spectral signatures, isolating X-ray transient classes, and supports downstream tasks like anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The framework is flexible, scalable, and generalizable for analyzing event time series across domains.

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular
time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality.
They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational
social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and
seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant
challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena
using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional
tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders
that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings
support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection,
similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised
classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray
astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and
spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our
framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing
complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

*Fouad Oubari,Raphael Meunier,Rodrigue Décatoire,Mathilde Mougeot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper evaluates five deep generative models for industrial tire design tasks, highlighting diffusion models' superior performance, with specific strengths in conditional and constrained scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of clarity on which deep generative models are best suited for complex manufacturing design tasks, particularly in industrial tire architecture generation.

Method: Comparative study of five models (VAE, GAN, MMVAE, DDPM, MDM) across three industrial scenarios: unconditional generation, component-conditioned generation, and dimension-constrained generation. Introduces categorical inpainting for discrete diffusion models.

Result: Diffusion models perform best overall; masking-trained VAE excels in component-conditioned tasks, and MDM/DDPM show strengths in in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, respectively.

Conclusion: Diffusion models are most effective for industrial tire design, with tailored approaches (e.g., categorical inpainting) enhancing conditional performance.

Abstract: As deep generative models proliferate across the AI landscape, industrial
practitioners still face critical yet unanswered questions about which deep
generative models best suit complex manufacturing design tasks. This work
addresses this question through a complete study of five representative models
(Variational Autoencoder, Generative Adversarial Network, multimodal
Variational Autoencoder, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, and
Multinomial Diffusion Model) on industrial tire architecture generation. Our
evaluation spans three key industrial scenarios: (i) unconditional generation
of complete multi-component designs, (ii) component-conditioned generation
(reconstructing architectures from partial observations), and (iii)
dimension-constrained generation (creating designs that satisfy specific
dimensional requirements). To enable discrete diffusion models to handle
conditional scenarios, we introduce categorical inpainting, a mask-aware
reverse diffusion process that preserves known labels without requiring
additional training. Our evaluation employs geometry-aware metrics specifically
calibrated for industrial requirements, quantifying spatial coherence,
component interaction, structural connectivity, and perceptual fidelity. Our
findings reveal that diffusion models achieve the strongest overall
performance; a masking-trained VAE nonetheless outperforms the multimodal
variant MMVAE\textsuperscript{+} on nearly all component-conditioned metrics,
and within the diffusion family MDM leads in-distribution whereas DDPM
generalises better to out-of-distribution dimensional constraints.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces metrics like dropout robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity to predict grokking, a delayed generalization phenomenon in neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and forecast grokking behavior, which involves delayed test accuracy improvement after training accuracy stabilizes.

Method: Proposes practical metrics including variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures. Uses Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) to estimate resilience to noise during inference.

Result: Metrics like DRC, variance under dropout, inactive neuron percentage, and embedding distribution patterns correlate with grokking behavior.

Conclusion: The introduced metrics effectively forecast grokking and provide insights into its origin and behavior.

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test
accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in
training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including
variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity
measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of
neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout
Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the
dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The
variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training
checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally,
the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the
embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that
correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries.
These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and
behaviour of grokking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A privacy-preserving FL evaluation protocol using ZKPs to verify local loss without revealing raw data, tested on MNIST and HAR datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL evaluations risk leaking sensitive data through shared metrics; ZKPs offer a solution for privacy-preserving verification.

Method: Clients generate ZKP proofs asserting local loss is below a threshold, avoiding raw data exposure. Implemented with self-contained modules for FL simulation and ZKP circuits.

Result: Evaluated on CNN (MNIST) and MLP (HAR), showing trade-offs in computational overhead, communication cost, and verifiability.

Conclusion: The protocol successfully enables private and verifiable FL evaluations, though with some performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data without exposing raw data. However, the evaluation phase in FL may leak
sensitive information through shared performance metrics. In this paper, we
propose a novel protocol that incorporates Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to
enable privacy-preserving and verifiable evaluation for FL. Instead of
revealing raw loss values, clients generate a succinct proof asserting that
their local loss is below a predefined threshold. Our approach is implemented
without reliance on external APIs, using self-contained modules for federated
learning simulation, ZKP circuit design, and experimental evaluation on both
the MNIST and Human Activity Recognition (HAR) datasets. We focus on a
threshold-based proof for a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
(for MNIST) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model (for HAR), and evaluate
the approach in terms of computational overhead, communication cost, and
verifiability.

*Joao F. Rocha,Ke Xu,Xingzhi Sun,Ananya Krishna,Dhananjay Bhaskar,Blanche Mongeon,Morgan Craig,Mark Gerstein,Smita Krishnaswamy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces STAGED, a method combining agent-based modeling and deep learning to model cellular dynamics and interactions in spatial transcriptomics data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods treat cells as independent points, missing dynamic interactions. Spatial transcriptomics allows studying cellular organization and interactions, but computational advances are needed for data-driven learning.

Method: STAGED integrates agent-based modeling with deep learning, using graph ODE networks and attention mechanisms to model intercellular communication and gene regulatory networks.

Result: The model captures intercellular and intracellular interactions, providing adaptive and accurate representations of cellular dynamics.

Conclusion: STAGED offers a data-driven approach to study complex cellular interactions, improving understanding of cellular states and dynamics.

Abstract: The advent of single-cell technology has significantly improved our
understanding of cellular states and subpopulations in various tissues under
normal and diseased conditions by employing data-driven approaches such as
clustering and trajectory inference. However, these methods consider cells as
independent data points of population distributions. With spatial
transcriptomics, we can represent cellular organization, along with dynamic
cell-cell interactions that lead to changes in cell state. Still, key
computational advances are necessary to enable the data-driven learning of such
complex interactive cellular dynamics. While agent-based modeling (ABM)
provides a powerful framework, traditional approaches rely on handcrafted rules
derived from domain knowledge rather than data-driven approaches. To address
this, we introduce Spatio Temporal Agent-Based Graph Evolution Dynamics(STAGED)
integrating ABM with deep learning to model intercellular communication, and
its effect on the intracellular gene regulatory network. Using graph ODE
networks (GDEs) with shared weights per cell type, our approach represents
genes as vertices and interactions as directed edges, dynamically learning
their strengths through a designed attention mechanism. Trained to match
continuous trajectories of simulated as well as inferred trajectories from
spatial transcriptomics data, the model captures both intercellular and
intracellular interactions, enabling a more adaptive and accurate
representation of cellular dynamics.

*Travis Pence,Daisuke Yamada,Vikas Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores the compositional structure of linear layers in large models using Clifford algebra, identifying bivectors as fundamental primitives and introducing a parameter-efficient rotor-based decomposition method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and synthesize the fundamental building blocks (geometric primitives) that compose into richer functionalities in linear layers of large models.

Method: Uses Clifford algebra to express linear layers as compositions of bivectors and introduces a differentiable algorithm for decomposing them into rotors, requiring fewer parameters than dense matrices.

Result: The rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines (e.g., block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations) in LLM attention layers.

Conclusion: The study provides an algebraic perspective on how geometric primitives compose into higher-level functions in deep models, offering a parameter-efficient alternative.

Abstract: Contemporary large models often exhibit behaviors suggesting the presence of
low-level primitives that compose into modules with richer functionality, but
these fundamental building blocks remain poorly understood. We investigate this
compositional structure in linear layers by asking: can we identify/synthesize
linear transformations from a minimal set of geometric primitives? Using
Clifford algebra, we show that linear layers can be expressed as compositions
of bivectors -- geometric objects encoding oriented planes -- and introduce a
differentiable algorithm that decomposes them into products of rotors. This
construction uses only O(log^2 d) parameters, versus O(d^2) required by dense
matrices. Applied to the key, query, and value projections in LLM attention
layers, our rotor-based layers match the performance of strong baselines such
as block-Hadamard and low-rank approximations. Our findings provide an
algebraic perspective on how these geometric primitives can compose into
higher-level functions within deep models.

*Amaya Dharmasiri,William Yang,Polina Kirichenko,Lydia Liu,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coreset selection methods impact dataset biases and model robustness, with embedding-based scores reducing bias risk compared to learning dynamics. However, prioritizing difficult samples doesn't ensure robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how dataset reduction methods affect biases and model robustness, given the prevalence of spurious correlations in datasets.

Method: Analyzed ten spurious correlation benchmarks, five score metrics, and five data selection policies across various coreset sizes.

Result: Embedding-based scores reduce bias risk, but prioritizing difficult samples doesn't guarantee robustness.

Conclusion: Coreset selection methods influence bias levels but require careful design to ensure downstream model robustness.

Abstract: Coreset selection methods have shown promise in reducing the training data
size while maintaining model performance for data-efficient machine learning.
However, as many datasets suffer from biases that cause models to learn
spurious correlations instead of causal features, it is important to understand
whether and how dataset reduction methods may perpetuate, amplify, or mitigate
these biases. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the
implications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected
coresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an
extensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations
benchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,
and five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.
Thereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between
sample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant
model robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using
embedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk
of inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based
on learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some
coreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing
difficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.

*Hein de Wilde,Ali Mohammed Mansoor Alsahag,Pierre Blanchet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study proposes an LSTM-based system using satellite data to predict leaf-fall timings for UK railroads, reducing prediction errors to 6.32 and 9.31 days for start and end, respectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leaf-fall disrupts UK railroads, costing over £300M annually. Current prediction methods lack scalability and reliability, necessitating a better solution.

Method: An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-fall data, multispectral, and meteorological satellite data.

Result: RMSE of 6.32 days for start and 9.31 days for end of leaf-fall, outperforming prior methods.

Conclusion: The model improves leaf-fall prediction, aiding rail operators in scheduling mitigation measures and advancing ecological understanding.

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail
industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions
are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being
treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the
timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network
operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures.
However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable
limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to
devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and
the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable
insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth
leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data
demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of
leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which
improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for
the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the
improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces preference-based MDPs (PbMDPs) with Borda scores, establishes a regret lower bound, and proposes algorithms achieving sublinear regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in learning MDPs where preferences (not numerical losses) are observed, focusing on Borda scores for reward functions.

Method: Derives regret lower bounds, proposes global optimization and policy optimization algorithms for PbMDPs with known/unknown transitions.

Result: Achieves regret bounds of $	ilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3} T^{2/3})$ and $	ilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for known transitions, extending to unknown transitions.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for PbMDPs, balancing regret bounds and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs
(PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the
numerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead
observes preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices
being compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the
reward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a
regret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we
present a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{HSAT})$ for
episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per
episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is
the number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret
lower bound of $\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda
scores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that
achieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global
optimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all
occupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from
suboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and
computational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization
algorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3}
T^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the
unknown-transition setting.

*Jay Revolinsky,Harry Shomer,Jiliang Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLEX is a GGM framework combining structurally-conditioned graph generation and adversarial co-training to improve link prediction in OOD scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GNNs for link prediction assume uniform data distribution, and GGMs are underutilized. FLEX aims to bridge this gap by enhancing OOD performance.

Method: FLEX uses two mechanisms: structurally-conditioned graph generation and adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN.

Result: FLEX improves link prediction in OOD settings, validated by experiments in synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: FLEX effectively enhances OOD link prediction without requiring domain expertise, with potential insights into graph data augmentation.

Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link
prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples
being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models
(GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this,
GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge
this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1)
structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training
between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment
between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert
knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are
conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's
performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the
effects of graph data augmentation on link structures. The source code is

*Amirhossein Ahmadi,Hamidreza Zareipour,Henry Leung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores global forecasting models (GFMs) for load prediction in power networks, addressing limitations of local models (LFMs) like generalizability and scalability. It investigates feature- and target-transforming models, proposing clustering methods to handle data heterogeneity and drift. GFMs, especially target-transforming ones, outperform LFMs when enhanced with global features and clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional local forecasting models (LFMs) struggle with generalizability, scalability, and data drift. GFMs offer a promising alternative to improve accuracy and robustness in load forecasting.

Method: The study examines feature-transforming and target-transforming GFMs, proposing time series clustering (TSC) methods to manage data heterogeneity. Experiments use Alberta's electricity load data.

Result: Global target-transforming models outperform local models, especially with global features and clustering. Feature-transforming models face challenges balancing local and global dynamics.

Conclusion: GFMs, particularly target-transforming ones, enhance load forecasting performance. Clustering methods help address data heterogeneity, making GFMs a viable solution for scalable and accurate predictions.

Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various
hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of
delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local
forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in
handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.
These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally
expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In
contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance
prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through
globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load
forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of
different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore
feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how
globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In
addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its
potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the
balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series
clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming
models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.
Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity
load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently
outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global
features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming
models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring
TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEE-powered GNN (GG), a framework using one-hot graph encoder embedding (GEE) for better initial node features in GNNs, improving performance and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs often suffer from suboptimal performance due to poor initial feature representations. This work aims to enhance GNNs by using statistically grounded GEE for feature initialization.

Method: The proposed GG framework integrates GEE to generate high-quality initial node features. An enhanced variant, GG-C, concatenates GG and GEE outputs for node classification.

Result: GG achieves state-of-the-art performance in node clustering and faster convergence. GG-C outperforms baselines in node classification.

Conclusion: Principled, structure-aware feature initialization (via GEE) is crucial for maximizing GNN potential, as demonstrated by GG and GG-C.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for a wide
range of node-level graph learning tasks. However, their performance is often
constrained by reliance on random or minimally informed initial feature
representations, which can lead to slow convergence and suboptimal solutions.
In this paper, we leverage a statistically grounded method, one-hot graph
encoder embedding (GEE), to generate high-quality initial node features that
enhance the end-to-end training of GNNs. We refer to this integrated framework
as the GEE-powered GNN (GG), and demonstrate its effectiveness through
extensive simulations and real-world experiments across both unsupervised and
supervised settings. In node clustering, GG consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, ranking first across all evaluated real-world
datasets, while exhibiting faster convergence compared to the standard GNN. For
node classification, we further propose an enhanced variant, GG-C, which
concatenates the outputs of GG and GEE and outperforms competing baselines.
These results confirm the importance of principled, structure-aware feature
initialization in realizing the full potential of GNNs.

Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in SINDy models is crucial for reliability, especially in safety-critical applications. Existing methods lack minimal assumptions and coverage guarantees.

Method: The study integrates Conformal Prediction with E-SINDy, applying it to time series prediction, model selection, and coefficient uncertainty quantification.

Result: Conformal Prediction with E-SINDy reliably achieves target coverage, quantifies feature importance, and provides robust uncertainty intervals under non-Gaussian noise.

Conclusion: The integration of Conformal Prediction with E-SINDy enhances uncertainty quantification in SINDy models, offering reliable coverage and robustness.

Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) is a method for
discovering nonlinear dynamical system models from data. Quantifying
uncertainty in SINDy models is essential for assessing their reliability,
particularly in safety-critical applications. While various uncertainty
quantification methods exist for SINDy, including Bayesian and ensemble
approaches, this work explores the integration of Conformal Prediction, a
framework that can provide valid prediction intervals with coverage guarantees
based on minimal assumptions like data exchangeability. We introduce three
applications of conformal prediction with Ensemble-SINDy (E-SINDy): (1)
quantifying uncertainty in time series prediction, (2) model selection based on
library feature importance, and (3) quantifying the uncertainty of identified
model coefficients using feature conformal prediction. We demonstrate the three
applications on stochastic predator-prey dynamics and several chaotic dynamical
systems. We show that conformal prediction methods integrated with E-SINDy can
reliably achieve desired target coverage for time series forecasting,
effectively quantify feature importance, and produce more robust uncertainty
intervals for model coefficients, even under non-Gaussian noise, compared to
standard E-SINDy coefficient estimates.

### [167] [A Graph-in-Graph Learning Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11757)
*Yuehua Song,Yong Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel GNN-based framework, Graph-in-Graph (GiG), integrates transductive and inductive learning to improve drug-target interaction prediction by combining molecular and network-level features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine learning approaches, including GNNs, struggle to effectively integrate diverse drug and target features for DTI prediction.

Method: The GiG model represents drug and target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a DTI graph, enabling detailed relationship exploration.

Result: GiG outperforms existing methods across all evaluation metrics on a specialized benchmark of drug SMILES, protein sequences, and interaction data.

Conclusion: Integrating transductive and inductive learning with molecular and network-level features enhances DTI prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTIs) is pivotal for
advancing drug discovery and target validation techniques. While machine
learning approaches including those that are based on Graph Neural Networks
(GNN) have achieved notable success in DTI prediction, many of them have
difficulties in effectively integrating the diverse features of drugs, targets
and their interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel
framework to take advantage of the power of both transductive learning and
inductive learning so that features at molecular level and drug-target
interaction network level can be exploited. Within this framework is a
GNN-based model called Graph-in-Graph (GiG) that represents graphs of drug and
target molecular structures as meta-nodes in a drug-target interaction graph,
enabling a detailed exploration of their intricate relationships. To evaluate
the proposed model, we have compiled a special benchmark comprising drug
SMILES, protein sequences, and their interaction data, which is interesting in
its own right. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GiG model
significantly outperforms existing approaches across all evaluation metrics,
highlighting the benefits of integrating different learning paradigms and
interaction data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet, efficiently samples molecular conformations proportional to the Boltzmann distribution, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating stable molecular conformations is critical for drug discovery, but traditional methods like molecular dynamics are inefficient. Generative machine learning offers a promising alternative.

Method: Torsional-GFN conditions on molecular graphs and local structures to sample torsion angle rotations, using only a reward function for training.

Result: The model samples conformations proportional to the Boltzmann distribution and generalizes zero-shot to unseen bond lengths and angles from MD simulations.

Conclusion: Torsional-GFN shows potential for scaling to larger systems, zero-shot generalization to new molecules, and integrating local structure generation.

Abstract: Generating stable molecular conformations is crucial in several drug
discovery applications, such as estimating the binding affinity of a molecule
to a target. Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a
promising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of
conformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce
Torsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample
conformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,
using only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular
graph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples
rotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is
able to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann
distribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for
zero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD
simulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for
scaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot
generalization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local
structure into the GFlowNet model.

*Sheikh Abdur Raheem Ali,Justin Xu,Ivory Yang,Jasmine Xinze Li,Ayse Arslan,Clark Benham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper examines the effectiveness of Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) across different scales of Llama 2 models, finding it works best in early-mid layers, loses efficacy with larger models, and negative steering is more impactful than positive.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the scalability and effectiveness of CAA, a less widely deployed alignment technique, as LLMs grow in complexity and capability.

Method: Applied CAA to Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, 70B) by manipulating the residual stream using contrastive pairs (e.g., hate to love) and evaluated refusal behavior.

Result: CAA is most effective in early-mid layers, less effective in larger models, and negative steering outperforms positive steering.

Conclusion: CAA's effectiveness varies with model scale and layer placement, with negative steering being more impactful, suggesting limitations for large-scale deployment.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the
efficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building
on previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition
(CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the
family of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable
'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive
pairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual
stream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and
aims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs.
Using answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found
that 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The
effectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more
pronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.

TL;DR: The study uses an XGBoost Classifier to predict delays in the Dutch railway network, focusing on topological features and network-wide patterns. Despite limited performance, it highlights the need for context-specific adaptations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in delay prediction studies for the Dutch railway network, focusing on broader network-wide patterns to mitigate ripple effects.

Method: Employed an XGBoost Classifier, integrating Node Centrality Measures, and compared it with other classifiers (RandomForest, DecisionTree, etc.) to predict delayed trajectories.

Result: Limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, indicating the need for more context-specific adaptations.

Conclusion: The research contributes to transportation network evaluation and suggests future directions for more robust delay prediction models.

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays
being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This
research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway
network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological
features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and
neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple
effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,
originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air
network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node
Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,
DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is
to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited
performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the
necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research
contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and
proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for
delays.

*Alessandro Palma,Sergei Rybakov,Leon Hetzel,Stephan Günnemann,Fabian J. Theis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlatVI is a training framework for variational autoencoders that enforces Euclidean geometry in latent space, improving trajectory reconstruction in single-cell RNA sequencing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume linear shifts and Euclidean geometry in latent space, which may not align with geodesic paths on the data manifold, limiting accuracy.

Method: FlatVI regularizes the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders to encourage Euclidean geometry, ensuring straight lines in latent space approximate geodesic interpolations.

Result: Experiments show improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation in synthetic and time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data.

Conclusion: FlatVI enhances compatibility with downstream methods assuming Euclidean geometry, offering better modeling of cellular state transitions.

Abstract: Latent space interpolations are a powerful tool for navigating deep
generative models in applied settings. An example is single-cell RNA
sequencing, where existing methods model cellular state transitions as latent
space interpolations with variational autoencoders, often assuming linear
shifts and Euclidean geometry. However, unless explicitly enforced, linear
interpolations in the latent space may not correspond to geodesic paths on the
data manifold, limiting methods that assume Euclidean geometry in the data
representations. We introduce FlatVI, a novel training framework that
regularises the latent manifold of discrete-likelihood variational autoencoders
towards Euclidean geometry, specifically tailored for modelling single-cell
count data. By encouraging straight lines in the latent space to approximate
geodesic interpolations on the decoded single-cell manifold, FlatVI enhances
compatibility with downstream approaches that assume Euclidean latent geometry.
Experiments on synthetic data support the theoretical soundness of our
approach, while applications to time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing data
demonstrate improved trajectory reconstruction and manifold interpolation.

*Ruofan Hu,Dongyu Zhang,Huayi Zhang,Elke Rundensteiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLID-MU is a meta-learning method for noisy labels that avoids needing a clean labeled dataset by leveraging cross-layer data structure consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing meta-learning methods for noisy labels rely on clean labeled datasets, which are hard to obtain. This work aims to remove this dependency.

Method: Proposes CLID-MU, which uses cross-layer information divergence to align data structures and guide training without clean labels.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real-world noise.

Conclusion: CLID-MU effectively addresses noisy label learning without clean meta-data, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural
networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by
using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this
approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset,
which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the
challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean
labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the
need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively
preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and
the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the
Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU).
CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature
spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training.
Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both
synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at

TL;DR: SynCoGen is a framework for synthesizable 3D molecule generation, combining masked graph diffusion and flow matching, achieving state-of-the-art results in small molecule and conformer generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of synthesizability in generative small molecule design, especially in 3D geometry-based conditional generation, motivates the development of SynCoGen.

Method: SynCoGen uses masked graph diffusion and flow matching to sample from joint distributions of molecular building blocks, reactions, and atomic coordinates, trained on the SynSpace dataset.

Result: SynCoGen excels in unconditional small molecule and conformer generation and performs competitively in zero-shot molecular linker design.

Conclusion: SynCoGen's multimodal approach lays a foundation for future applications like analog expansion and lead optimization in drug discovery.

Abstract: Ensuring synthesizability in generative small molecule design remains a major
challenge. While recent developments in synthesizable molecule generation have
demonstrated promising results, these efforts have been largely confined to 2D
molecular graph representations, limiting the ability to perform geometry-based
conditional generation. In this work, we present SynCoGen (Synthesizable
Co-Generation), a single framework that combines simultaneous masked graph
diffusion and flow matching for synthesizable 3D molecule generation. SynCoGen
samples from the joint distribution of molecular building blocks, chemical
reactions, and atomic coordinates. To train the model, we curated SynSpace, a
dataset containing over 600K synthesis-aware building block graphs and 3.3M
conformers. SynCoGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional
small molecule graph and conformer generation, and the model delivers
competitive performance in zero-shot molecular linker design for protein ligand
generation in drug discovery. Overall, this multimodal formulation represents a
foundation for future applications enabled by non-autoregressive molecular
generation, including analog expansion, lead optimization, and direct structure
conditioning.

TL;DR: MNIST-Gen is a framework for generating MNIST-style datasets tailored to specific domains, combining CLIP, reinforcement learning, and human feedback for efficient and accurate categorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard datasets like MNIST are generic and insufficient for domain-specific tasks. Creating custom datasets is often impractical due to time, legal, or scope constraints.

Method: Uses CLIP-based semantic understanding, reinforcement learning, and human feedback in a hierarchical, modular framework. Supports multiple processing modes for flexibility.

Result: Achieves 85% automatic categorization accuracy and 80% time savings. Generated datasets (Tree-MNIST, Food-MNIST) demonstrate utility.

Conclusion: MNIST-Gen effectively addresses the need for domain-specific datasets, offering efficiency, modularity, and adaptability.

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST,
FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited
to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on
domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other
real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant.
Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming,
legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present
MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating
MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using
hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic
understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve
intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical
approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics,
enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes:
individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large
datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category
theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable
morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of
concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and
\textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing
task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization
accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

TL;DR: HyperEvent reframes dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition, using event correlation vectors to capture structural cohesion, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to capture the structural cohesion of composite hyper-events in dynamic graphs, limiting their predictive power.

Method: HyperEvent dynamically constructs association sequences using event correlation vectors to quantify dependencies and predict hyper-events.

Result: HyperEvent outperforms baselines on 4 out of 5 datasets, achieving a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank on the Flight dataset with 10.17% training time.

Conclusion: HyperEvent effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods, offering superior accuracy and scalability for dynamic link prediction.

Abstract: Dynamic link prediction in continuous-time dynamic graphs is a fundamental
task for modeling evolving complex systems. Existing node-centric and
event-centric methods focus on individual interactions or atomic states,
failing to capture the structural cohesion of composite hyper-events, groups of
causally related events. To address this, we propose HyperEvent, a framework
reframing dynamic link prediction as hyper-event recognition. Central to
HyperEvent is the dynamic construction of an association sequence using event
correlation vectors. These vectors quantify pairwise dependencies between the
query event and relevant historical events, thereby characterizing the
structural cohesion of a potential hyper-event. The framework predicts the
occurrence of the query event by evaluating whether it collectively forms a
valid hyper-event with these historical events. Notably, HyperEvent outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on 4 out of 5 datasets in the official leaderboard.
For scalability, we further introduce an efficient parallel training algorithm
that segments large event streams to enable concurrent training. Experiments
validate HyperEvent's superior accuracy and efficiency on large-scale graphs.
Among which HyperEvent achieves a 6.95% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank
over state-of-the-art baseline on the large-scale Flight dataset while
utilizing only 10.17% of the training time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Protenix-Mini is a lightweight model for protein structure prediction, optimizing efficiency with a two-step ODE sampler, architectural pruning, and an ESM module, achieving near-full-scale accuracy with reduced computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance model efficiency and prediction accuracy for real-world deployment in biomolecular structure prediction.

Method: 1) Replace multi-step AF3 sampler with a few-step ODE sampler. 2) Prune redundant Transformer blocks. 3) Substitute MSA module with an ESM module.

Result: Protenix-Mini achieves high-fidelity predictions with only a 1-5% accuracy drop, significantly reducing computational overhead.

Conclusion: Protenix-Mini is ideal for resource-limited applications requiring accurate protein structure prediction.

Abstract: Lightweight inference is critical for biomolecular structure prediction and
other downstream tasks, enabling efficient real-world deployment and
inference-time scaling for large-scale applications. In this work, we address
the challenge of balancing model efficiency and prediction accuracy by making
several key modifications, 1) Multi-step AF3 sampler is replaced by a few-step
ODE sampler, significantly reducing computational overhead for the diffusion
module part during inference; 2) In the open-source Protenix framework, a
subset of pairformer or diffusion transformer blocks doesn't make contributions
to the final structure prediction, presenting opportunities for architectural
pruning and lightweight redesign; 3) A model incorporating an ESM module is
trained to substitute the conventional MSA module, reducing MSA preprocessing
time. Building on these key insights, we present Protenix-Mini, a compact and
optimized model designed for efficient protein structure prediction. This
streamlined version incorporates a more efficient architectural design with a
two-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sampling strategy. By eliminating
redundant Transformer components and refining the sampling process,
Protenix-Mini significantly reduces model complexity with slight accuracy drop.
Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that it achieves high-fidelity
predictions, with only a negligible 1 to 5 percent decrease in performance on
benchmark datasets compared to its full-scale counterpart. This makes
Protenix-Mini an ideal choice for applications where computational resources
are limited but accurate structure prediction remains crucial.

*Yu-Jie Zhang,Sheng-An Xu,Peng Zhao,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a computationally and statistically efficient algorithm for the generalized linear bandit problem, achieving near-optimal regret with constant per-round complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem's non-linear nature poses challenges in balancing computational and statistical efficiency, which existing methods fail to address optimally.

Method: The authors introduce a jointly efficient algorithm using a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD) estimator, leveraging mix loss analysis for statistical efficiency.

Result: The algorithm achieves nearly optimal regret bounds with O(1) time and space per round, matching maximum likelihood estimation efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully balances computational and statistical efficiency in GLB problems, offering practical applicability.

Abstract: We study the generalized linear bandit (GLB) problem, a contextual
multi-armed bandit framework that extends the classical linear model by
incorporating a non-linear link function, thereby modeling a broad class of
reward distributions such as Bernoulli and Poisson. While GLBs are widely
applicable to real-world scenarios, their non-linear nature introduces
significant challenges in achieving both computational and statistical
efficiency. Existing methods typically trade off between two objectives, either
incurring high per-round costs for optimal regret guarantees or compromising
statistical efficiency to enable constant-time updates. In this paper, we
propose a jointly efficient algorithm that attains a nearly optimal regret
bound with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexities per round. The core of
our method is a tight confidence set for the online mirror descent (OMD)
estimator, which is derived through a novel analysis that leverages the notion
of mix loss from online prediction. The analysis shows that our OMD estimator,
even with its one-pass updates, achieves statistical efficiency comparable to
maximum likelihood estimation, thereby leading to a jointly efficient
optimistic method.

*Davin Hill,Brian L. Hill,Aria Masoomi,Vijay S. Nori,Robert E. Tillman,Jennifer Dy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OrdShap is a new attribution method that separates the effects of feature values and their positions in sequences, offering deeper model insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attribution methods assume fixed feature ordering, conflating feature values and positions, limiting understanding of sequential models.

Method: OrdShap quantifies attribution by permuting feature positions, leveraging game theory for theoretical grounding.

Result: Empirical tests on health, NLP, and synthetic data show OrdShap effectively captures value and position attributions.

Conclusion: OrdShap provides a clearer, position-sensitive understanding of sequential model predictions.

Abstract: Sequential deep learning models excel in domains with temporal or sequential
dependencies, but their complexity necessitates post-hoc feature attribution
methods for understanding their predictions. While existing techniques quantify
feature importance, they inherently assume fixed feature ordering - conflating
the effects of (1) feature values and (2) their positions within input
sequences. To address this gap, we introduce OrdShap, a novel attribution
method that disentangles these effects by quantifying how a model's predictions
change in response to permuting feature position. We establish a game-theoretic
connection between OrdShap and Sanchez-Berganti\~nos values, providing a
theoretically grounded approach to position-sensitive attribution. Empirical
results from health, natural language, and synthetic datasets highlight
OrdShap's effectiveness in capturing feature value and feature position
attributions, and provide deeper insight into model behavior.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework to dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express services, enhancing learning efficiency and reducing early-stage losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of managing drivers' participation in Discount Express services, such as lack of historical data and high stochasticity, while improving matching efficiency and demand pool accessibility.

Method: The study formulates the problem as a continuous control task and introduces the pi-DDPG framework, which includes a refiner module, convolutional LSTM for spatiotemporal patterns, and prioritized experience replay.

Result: Numerical experiments show pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces early-stage training losses.

Conclusion: The proposed pi-DDPG framework effectively addresses the challenges of dynamic driver management in Discount Express services, offering practical benefits for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of platform integration has emerged as an effective
solution to mitigate market fragmentation by consolidating multiple
ride-hailing platforms into a single application. To address heterogeneous
passenger preferences, third-party integrators provide Discount Express service
delivered by express drivers at lower trip fares. For the individual platform,
encouraging broader participation of drivers in Discount Express services has
the potential to expand the accessible demand pool and improve matching
efficiency, but often at the cost of reduced profit margins. This study aims to
dynamically manage drivers' acceptance of Discount Express from the perspective
of individual platforms. The lack of historical data under the new business
model necessitates online learning. However, early-stage exploration through
trial and error can be costly in practice, highlighting the need for reliable
early-stage performance in real-world deployment. To address these challenges,
this study formulates the decision regarding the proportion of drivers'
acceptance behavior as a continuous control task. In response to the high
stochasticity, the opaque matching mechanisms employed by third-party
integrator, and the limited availability of historical data, we propose a
policy-improved deep deterministic policy gradient (pi-DDPG) framework. The
proposed framework incorporates a refiner module to boost policy performance
during the early training phase, leverages a convolutional long short-term
memory network to effectively capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and
adopts a prioritized experience replay mechanism to enhance learning
efficiency. A simulator based on a real-world dataset is developed to validate
the effectiveness of the proposed pi-DDPG. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that pi-DDPG achieves superior learning efficiency and significantly reduces
early-stage training losses.

*Juscimara G. Avelino,George D. C. Cavalcanti,Rafael M. O. Cruz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Meta-IR, a meta-learning framework for imbalanced regression tasks, which recommends optimal resampling and learning model pipelines without extensive testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced regression tasks lack efficient solutions due to the rarity of certain target values and the need to test many combinations of resampling methods and learning models.

Method: Meta-IR trains meta-classifiers using meta-features to recommend the best pipeline (resampling strategy and learning model) in a zero-shot fashion. Two formulations are proposed: Independent (separate recommendations) and Chained (sequential recommendations).

Result: The Chained formulation outperformed Independent and other baselines, including AutoML frameworks and 42 configurations of learning and resampling methods.

Conclusion: Meta-IR effectively addresses imbalanced regression by leveraging meta-learning to recommend optimal pipelines, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Imbalanced problems are prevalent in various real-world scenarios and are
extensively explored in classification tasks. However, they also present
challenges for regression tasks due to the rarity of certain target values. A
common alternative is to employ balancing algorithms in preprocessing to
address dataset imbalance. However, due to the variety of resampling methods
and learning models, determining the optimal solution requires testing many
combinations. Furthermore, the learning model, dataset, and evaluation metric
affect the best strategies. This work proposes the Meta-learning for Imbalanced
Regression (Meta-IR) framework, which diverges from existing literature by
training meta-classifiers to recommend the best pipeline composed of the
resampling strategy and learning model per task in a zero-shot fashion. The
meta-classifiers are trained using a set of meta-features to learn how to map
the meta-features to the classes indicating the best pipeline. We propose two
formulations: Independent and Chained. Independent trains the meta-classifiers
to separately indicate the best learning algorithm and resampling strategy.
Chained involves a sequential procedure where the output of one meta-classifier
is used as input for another to model intrinsic relationship factors. The
Chained scenario showed superior performance, suggesting a relationship between
the learning algorithm and the resampling strategy per task. Compared with
AutoML frameworks, Meta-IR obtained better results. Moreover, compared with
baselines of six learning algorithms and six resampling algorithms plus no
resampling, totaling 42 (6 X 7) configurations, Meta-IR outperformed all of
them. The code, data, and further information of the experiments can be found

Result: Insights into the advantages of balancing strategies for regression models, with directions for future research.

Conclusion: The study provides a framework and evaluation for imbalanced regression, with open access to code and data for further exploration.

Abstract: Imbalanced problems can arise in different real-world situations, and to
address this, certain strategies in the form of resampling or balancing
algorithms are proposed. This issue has largely been studied in the context of
classification, and yet, the same problem features in regression tasks, where
target values are continuous. This work presents an extensive experimental
study comprising various balancing and predictive models, and wich uses metrics
to capture important elements for the user and to evaluate the predictive model
in an imbalanced regression data context. It also proposes a taxonomy for
imbalanced regression approaches based on three crucial criteria: regression
model, learning process, and evaluation metrics. The study offers new insights
into the use of such strategies, highlighting the advantages they bring to each
model's learning process, and indicating directions for further studies. The

### [182] [From Generative to Episodic: Sample-Efficient Replicable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11926)
*Max Hopkins,Sihan Liu,Christopher Ye,Yuichi Yoshida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of replicable learning in reinforcement learning (RL), showing that exploration is not a significant barrier. It presents an algorithm with sample complexity $	ilde{O}(S^2A)$, nearly matching lower bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The replicability crisis in empirical science and machine learning motivates the study of replicable algorithms, especially in RL where exploration complicates data efficiency.

Method: The authors develop a replicable RL algorithm for low-horizon tabular MDPs, analyzing its sample complexity and comparing it to existing bounds.

Result: The algorithm achieves $	ilde{O}(S^2A)$ sample complexity, bridging the gap between generative and episodic settings, with near-optimal lower bounds.

Conclusion: Replicable exploration in RL is feasible and not inherently more expensive than batch learning, resolving a key theoretical question.

Abstract: The epidemic failure of replicability across empirical science and machine
learning has recently motivated the formal study of replicable learning
algorithms [Impagliazzo et al. (2022)]. In batch settings where data comes from
a fixed i.i.d. source (e.g., hypothesis testing, supervised learning), the
design of data-efficient replicable algorithms is now more or less understood.
In contrast, there remain significant gaps in our knowledge for control
settings like reinforcement learning where an agent must interact directly with
a shifting environment. Karbasi et. al show that with access to a generative
model of an environment with $S$ states and $A$ actions (the RL 'batch
setting'), replicably learning a near-optimal policy costs only
$\tilde{O}(S^2A^2)$ samples. On the other hand, the best upper bound without a
generative model jumps to $\tilde{O}(S^7 A^7)$ [Eaton et al. (2024)] due to the
substantial difficulty of environment exploration. This gap raises a key
question in the broader theory of replicability: Is replicable exploration
inherently more expensive than batch learning? Is sample-efficient replicable
RL even possible?
  In this work, we (nearly) resolve this problem (for low-horizon tabular
MDPs): exploration is not a significant barrier to replicable learning! Our
main result is a replicable RL algorithm on $\tilde{O}(S^2A)$ samples, bridging
the gap between the generative and episodic settings. We complement this with a
matching $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2A)$ lower bound in the generative setting (under
the common parallel sampling assumption) and an unconditional lower bound in
the episodic setting of $\tilde{\Omega}(S^2)$ showcasing the near-optimality of
our algorithm with respect to the state space $S$.

TL;DR: A machine learning framework reduces RF power amplifier simulation needs by 65% while maintaining high accuracy, using MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling and CatBoost for efficient design exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize simulation time and computational resources in RF power amplifier design without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Combines MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling with CatBoost gradient boosting to strategically select 35% of critical simulation points, predicting P2dB performance.

Result: Achieves ±0.3 to ±0.4 dBm accuracy, 58.24% to 77.78% simulation time reduction, and an average R² of 0.901 across 15 PA modes.

Conclusion: The framework enables rapid, accurate RF power amplifier design iterations, meeting production standards efficiently.

Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-accelerated optimization framework for
RF power amplifier design that reduces simulation requirements by 65% while
maintaining $\pm0.3$ to $\pm0.4$ dBm accuracy. The proposed method combines
MaxMin Latin Hypercube Sampling with CatBoost gradient boosting to
intelligently explore multidimensional parameter spaces. Instead of
exhaustively simulating all parameter combinations to achieve target P2dB
compression specifications, our approach strategically selects approximately
35% of critical simulation points. The framework processes ADS netlists,
executes harmonic balance simulations on the reduced dataset, and trains a
CatBoost model to predict P2dB performance across the entire design space.
Validation across 15 PA operating modes yields an average $R^2$ of 0.901, with
the system ranking parameter combinations by their likelihood of meeting target
specifications. The integrated solution delivers 58.24% to 77.78% reduction in
simulation time through automated GUI-based workflows, enabling rapid design
iterations without compromising accuracy standards required for production RF
circuits.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kevin, a model trained with multi-turn RL, improves CUDA kernel generation, achieving higher correctness and speedup over base and frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU kernel writing is iterative and performance-critical, making it suitable for RL. Challenges include learning from long trajectories and reward attribution.

Method: Developed a multi-turn RL recipe for CUDA kernel generation and optimization, addressing real-world challenges.

Result: Kevin improved correctness from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to 1.10x, surpassing frontier models.

Conclusion: Multi-turn RL is effective; scaling serial refinement yields better results than parallel sampling.

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems'
efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve
performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable
rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply
Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of
this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that
addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as
learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns.
We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL
for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin
shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of
generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to
1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini
(0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found
scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In
particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of
improvement.

### [185] [Online Training and Pruning of Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11975)
*Valentin Frank Ingmar Guenter,Athanasios Sideris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes integrating simultaneous training and pruning in RL, specifically for OFENet-enhanced algorithms, using stochastic optimization and variational Bernoulli distributions to prune inactive units, achieving efficient RL agents with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling deep RL networks improves performance but increases computational and memory costs. Pruning methods, successful in supervised learning, are underexplored in RL.

Method: Proposes XiNet, training RL networks with stochastic optimization over weights and variational Bernoulli distributions for pruning. Uses cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization tailored to DenseNet OFENets.

Result: Demonstrates significant pruning of OFENets with minimal performance loss on MuJoCo benchmarks using Soft Actor-Critic, showing pruned networks outperform smaller trained-from-scratch ones.

Conclusion: Pruning during training yields more efficient and higher-performing RL agents, validating the method's effectiveness in combining RL objectives with network compression.

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used
but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased
computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have
successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their
application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate
simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to
RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our
networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the
RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions
for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The
stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote
convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little
to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered
permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,
sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture
of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of
the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with
the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are
automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network
compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)
and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned
considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm
that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher
performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

### [186] [Can LLMs Find Fraudsters? Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11997)
*Tairan Huang,Yili Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MLED is a multi-level LLM-enhanced framework for graph fraud detection, leveraging LLMs to extract textual knowledge and integrate it with graph structures for improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph fraud detection methods overlook raw textual information and struggle with multimodal fusion of text and graph data.

Method: MLED uses LLMs to extract external knowledge and integrates it via type-level and relation-level enhancers to distinguish fraudsters.

Result: MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance on four real-world datasets.

Conclusion: MLED is a generalized framework that enhances existing graph fraud detection methods by effectively combining LLM-processed text with graph structures.

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within
multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use
preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal
fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual
information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful
capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant
challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with
graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM
\textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In
MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to
enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure
information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a
multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and
relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the
fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of
the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world
datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud
detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A computational approach using smartwatch data (audio and inertial) detects in-person conversations, achieving 82% F1-score in lab and 77% in semi-natural settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of human social interactions, especially verbal conversations, in challenging acoustic environments.

Method: Developed a framework using machine/deep learning with 3 fusion methods for audio and inertial data from smartwatches. Evaluated in lab (11 participants) and semi-natural (24 participants) studies.

Result: Achieved 82.0±3.0% F1-score in lab and 77.2±1.8% in semi-natural settings, showing benefits of multimodal fusion.

Conclusion: Multimodal sensing (audio + inertial) enhances conversation detection, useful for real-world applications.

Abstract: Social interactions play a crucial role in shaping human behavior,
relationships, and societies. It encompasses various forms of communication,
such as verbal conversation, non-verbal gestures, facial expressions, and body
language. In this work, we develop a novel computational approach to detect a
foundational aspect of human social interactions, in-person verbal
conversations, by leveraging audio and inertial data captured with a commodity
smartwatch in acoustically-challenging scenarios. To evaluate our approach, we
conducted a lab study with 11 participants and a semi-naturalistic study with
24 participants. We analyzed machine learning and deep learning models with 3
different fusion methods, showing the advantages of fusing audio and inertial
data to consider not only verbal cues but also non-verbal gestures in
conversations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive set of evaluations
across activities and sampling rates to demonstrate the benefits of multimodal
sensing in specific contexts. Overall, our framework achieved 82.0$\pm$3.0%
macro F1-score when detecting conversations in the lab and 77.2$\pm$1.8% in the
semi-naturalistic setting.

*Yao Lu,Hongyu Gao,Zhuangzhi Chen,Dongwei Xu,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DUSE is a data expansion framework for AMR that uses uncertainty scoring and active learning to address data scarcity, outperforming baselines in various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks for AMR require large labeled datasets, but target domain data is often scarce. Manual annotation is costly, and data augmentation doesn't solve the scarcity issue.

Method: DUSE employs an uncertainty scoring function to filter useful samples from AMR datasets and refines the scorer using active learning.

Result: DUSE outperforms 8 coreset selection baselines in class-balance and class-imbalance settings and shows strong cross-architecture generalization.

Conclusion: DUSE effectively addresses data scarcity in AMR by dynamically expanding samples and demonstrates superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field
of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large
amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the
available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model
training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert
annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common
method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a
certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot
fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges,
we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven
Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring
function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an
active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection
baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE
exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

### [189] [Granular feedback merits sophisticated aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12041)
*Anmol Kagrecha,Henrik Marklund,Potsawee Manakul,Richard Zeckhauser,Benjamin Van Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explores how feedback granularity impacts the effectiveness of methods for predicting population feedback distributions, showing sophisticated methods outperform regularized averaging with finer-grained feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback is valuable but costly to gather at scale, necessitating efficient methods to estimate population distributions from limited samples.

Method: The study compares regularized averaging with more sophisticated methods for combining feedback, analyzing their performance across different feedback granularities (binary vs. five-point).

Result: Sophisticated methods significantly outperform regularized averaging with finer-grained feedback (e.g., five-point), requiring about half as many individuals for similar performance.

Conclusion: Feedback granularity determines the effectiveness of prediction methods, with sophisticated approaches proving superior for high granularity.

Abstract: Human feedback is increasingly used across diverse applications like training
AI models, developing recommender systems, and measuring public opinion -- with
granular feedback often being preferred over binary feedback for its greater
informativeness. While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's
distribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,
cost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to
approximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the
empirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As
we will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.
  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using
feedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback
granularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of
regularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more
sophisticated than regularized averaging.
  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this
pattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the
number of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By
contrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance
of regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.

*Wen Wen,Tieliang Gong,Yunjiao Zhang,Zeyu Gao,Weizhan Zhang,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper presents a theoretical framework for replay-based continual learning, deriving information-theoretic bounds to explain generalization behavior and mitigate catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited theoretical understanding of generalization in replay-based continual learning methods.

Method: Establishes a unified theoretical framework with information-theoretic bounds, analyzing the interaction between memory buffers and current tasks. Uses stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method.

Result: The bounds show that limited exemplars of previous tasks improve generalization and mitigate forgetting. Tighter bounds are achieved with low-dimensional variables.

Conclusion: The framework effectively captures generalization dynamics in replay-based continual learning, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) has emerged as a dominant paradigm for acquiring
knowledge from sequential tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.
Although many CL methods have been proposed to show impressive empirical
performance, the theoretical understanding of their generalization behavior
remains limited, particularly for replay-based approaches. In this paper, we
establish a unified theoretical framework for replay-based CL, deriving a
series of information-theoretic bounds that explicitly characterize how the
memory buffer interacts with the current task to affect generalization.
Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds reveal that utilizing the limited
exemplars of previous tasks alongside the current task data, rather than
exhaustive replay, facilitates improved generalization while effectively
mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, our prediction-based bounds
yield tighter and computationally tractable upper bounds of the generalization
gap through the use of low-dimensional variables. Our analysis is general and
broadly applicable to a wide range of learning algorithms, exemplified by
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) as a representative method.
Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our
derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics in replay-based CL
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-driven method using cGANs to generate urban mobility flows, incorporating dynamic factors like land use and population density, outperforming traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban planners need accurate mobility simulations for sustainable development, but existing models either rely too much on historical data or assume static conditions.

Method: Uses conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend historical data with adaptive parameters like dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes.

Result: Demonstrated promising performance with Singapore mobile phone data, showing adaptability and accuracy without extensive calibration.

Conclusion: The approach offers a flexible, efficient solution for simulating future mobility patterns in evolving urban environments.

Abstract: The mobility patterns of people in cities evolve alongside changes in land
use and population. This makes it crucial for urban planners to simulate and
analyze human mobility patterns for purposes such as transportation
optimization and sustainable urban development. Existing generative models
borrowed from machine learning rely heavily on historical trajectories and
often overlook evolving factors like changes in population density and land
use. Mechanistic approaches incorporate population density and facility
distribution but assume static scenarios, limiting their utility for future
projections where historical data for calibration is unavailable. This study
introduces a novel, data-driven approach for generating origin-destination
mobility flows tailored to simulated urban scenarios. Our method leverages
adaptive factors such as dynamic region sizes and land use archetypes, and it
utilizes conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to blend
historical data with these adaptive parameters. The approach facilitates rapid
mobility flow generation with adjustable spatial granularity based on regions
of interest, without requiring extensive calibration data or complex behavior
modeling. The promising performance of our approach is demonstrated by its
application to mobile phone data from Singapore, and by its comparison with
existing methods.

*George Bird*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method for analyzing representational alignment reveals that algebraic symmetries in network primitives predict task-agnostic structure. Activation functions' algebraic properties influence whether representations discretize or remain continuous, impacting interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how functional form choices in neural networks introduce unintended inductive biases, particularly in forming discrete representations, and their implications for interpretability.

Method: Developed a tool based on Spotlight Resonance to study representational alignment, focusing on activation functions' algebraic symmetries through an ablation study.

Result: Discrete activation functions lead to discretized representations, while continuous ones maintain continuity. Quantization correlates with increased reconstruction error.

Conclusion: Functional form choices induce task-independent structural biases, influencing interpretability phenomena like grandmother neurons and superposition. The tool offers insights for emergent interpretability research.

Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology for determining representational
alignment, developed upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. Using this,
it is found that algebraic symmetries of network primitives are a strong
predictor for task-agnostic structure in representations. Particularly, this
new tool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can form and
arrange in autoencoder models, through an ablation study where only the
activation function is altered. Representations are found to tend to discretise
when the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic
permutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a
continuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. These findings
corroborate the hypothesis that functional form choices can carry unintended
inductive biases which produce task-independent artefactual structures in
representations, particularly that contemporary forms induce discretisation of
otherwise continuous structure -- a quantisation effect. Moreover, this
supports a general causal model for one mode in which discrete representations
may form, and could constitute a prerequisite for downstream interpretability
phenomena, including grandmother neurons, discrete coding schemes, general
linear features and possibly Superposition. Hence, this tool and proposed
mechanism for the influence of functional form on representations may provide
several insights into emergent interpretability research. Finally, preliminary
results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to correlate with
a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing previous conjectures
that this collapse can be detrimental.

### [193] [Measuring Informativeness Gap of (Mis)Calibrated Predictors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12094)
*Yiding Feng,Wei Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the 'informativeness gap' to compare miscalibrated predictors, generalizing existing notions like U-Calibration and Blackwell informativeness. It provides a dual characterization and a relaxed EMD-based measure for efficient estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-makers often face multiple miscalibrated models, needing a way to determine which is more useful for tasks. Existing measures are limited or specific.

Method: Defines the informativeness gap, generalizing prior concepts, and provides a dual characterization leading to a relaxed EMD-based measure.

Result: The measure is complete, sound, and sample-efficiently estimable. Novel combinatorial results are derived for perfectly calibrated predictors.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, generalizable way to compare predictors, with practical estimation methods and theoretical insights.

Abstract: In many applications, decision-makers must choose between multiple predictive
models that may all be miscalibrated. Which model (i.e., predictor) is more
"useful" in downstream decision tasks? To answer this, our first contribution
introduces the notion of the informativeness gap between any two predictors,
defined as the maximum normalized payoff advantage one predictor offers over
the other across all decision-making tasks. Our framework strictly generalizes
several existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration
Decision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its
calibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51,
Bla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated. Our
second contribution is a dual characterization of the informativeness gap,
which gives rise to a natural informativeness measure that can be viewed as a
relaxed variant of the earth mover's distance (EMD) between two prediction
distributions. We show that this measure satisfies natural desiderata: it is
complete and sound, and it can be estimated sample-efficiently in the
prediction-only access setting. Along the way, we also obtain novel
combinatorial structural results when applying this measure to perfectly
calibrated predictors.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a semi-supervised Federated Learning (FL) approach for spectrum sensing (FLSS) to address labeled data scarcity and data poisoning attacks, achieving high accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of wireless devices exacerbates spectrum scarcity, requiring dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA). Centralized ML-based DSA faces privacy and regulatory challenges, prompting the exploration of distributed FL-based solutions.

Method: A semi-supervised FL approach combined with energy detection trains models on unlabeled data. A novel defense mechanism, inspired by vaccination, counters data poisoning attacks without majority-based assumptions.

Result: FLSS achieves near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets and robustly defends against data poisoning attacks, even with malicious participants.

Conclusion: FLSS is a viable solution for spectrum sensing, addressing data scarcity and security vulnerabilities effectively.

Abstract: Advancements in wireless and mobile technologies, including 5G advanced and
the envisioned 6G, are driving exponential growth in wireless devices. However,
this rapid expansion exacerbates spectrum scarcity, posing a critical
challenge. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA)--which relies on sensing and
dynamically sharing spectrum--has emerged as an essential solution to address
this issue. While machine learning (ML) models hold significant potential for
improving spectrum sensing, their adoption in centralized ML-based DSA systems
is limited by privacy concerns, bandwidth constraints, and regulatory
challenges. To overcome these limitations, distributed ML-based approaches such
as Federated Learning (FL) offer promising alternatives. This work addresses
two key challenges in FL-based spectrum sensing (FLSS). First, the scarcity of
labeled data for training FL models in practical spectrum sensing scenarios is
tackled with a semi-supervised FL approach, combined with energy detection,
enabling model training on unlabeled datasets. Second, we examine the security
vulnerabilities of FLSS, focusing on the impact of data poisoning attacks. Our
analysis highlights the shortcomings of existing majority-based defenses in
countering such attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose a novel
defense mechanism inspired by vaccination, which effectively mitigates data
poisoning attacks without relying on majority-based assumptions. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our solutions,
demonstrating that FLSS can achieve near-perfect accuracy on unlabeled datasets
and maintain Byzantine robustness against both targeted and untargeted data
poisoning attacks, even when a significant proportion of participants are
malicious.

TL;DR: RiemannLoRA improves LoRA by treating LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold, addressing initialization and overparametrization issues, and outperforms standard LoRA in convergence and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in LoRA include optimal initialization and overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization, which RiemannLoRA aims to solve.

Method: Treats LoRA matrices as a smooth manifold, removes overparametrization, and uses Riemannian optimization for stable, efficient implementation.

Result: RiemannLoRA outperforms standard LoRA and its variants in convergence speed and final performance on LLMs and diffusion models.

Conclusion: RiemannLoRA provides a unified, efficient solution to LoRA's challenges, enhancing performance and convergence.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted standard for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), significantly
reducing memory and computational demands. However, challenges remain,
including finding optimal initialization strategies or mitigating
overparametrization in low-rank matrix factorization. In this work, we propose
a novel approach that addresses both of the challenges simultaneously within a
unified framework. Our method treats a set of fixed-rank LoRA matrices as a
smooth manifold. Considering adapters as elements on this manifold removes
overparametrization, while determining the direction of the fastest loss
decrease along the manifold provides initialization. Special care is taken to
obtain numerically stable and computationally efficient implementation of our
method, using best practices from numerical linear algebra and Riemannian
optimization. Experimental results on LLM and diffusion model architectures
demonstrate that RiemannLoRA consistently improves both convergence speed and
final performance over standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

TL;DR: FourCastNet 3 introduces a scalable ML approach for global weather forecasting, outperforming conventional models in accuracy and speed while maintaining realistic dynamics and spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve probabilistic ensemble forecasting by respecting spherical geometry and modeling spatial correlations accurately.

Method: Uses a convolutional neural network tailored for spherical geometry, with scalable training on 1024+ GPUs via a novel model- and data-parallelism paradigm.

Result: Achieves faster forecasts (8-60x speedup), excellent probabilistic calibration, and realistic spectra up to 60-day lead times.

Conclusion: FourCastNet 3 is a promising tool for meteorological forecasting and early warning systems due to its efficiency, accuracy, and stability.

Abstract: FourCastNet 3 advances global weather modeling by implementing a scalable,
geometric machine learning (ML) approach to probabilistic ensemble forecasting.
The approach is designed to respect spherical geometry and to accurately model
the spatially correlated probabilistic nature of the problem, resulting in
stable spectra and realistic dynamics across multiple scales. FourCastNet 3
delivers forecasting accuracy that surpasses leading conventional ensemble
models and rivals the best diffusion-based methods, while producing forecasts 8
to 60 times faster than these approaches. In contrast to other ML approaches,
FourCastNet 3 demonstrates excellent probabilistic calibration and retains
realistic spectra, even at extended lead times of up to 60 days. All of these
advances are realized using a purely convolutional neural network architecture
tailored for spherical geometry. Scalable and efficient large-scale training on
1024 GPUs and more is enabled by a novel training paradigm for combined model-
and data-parallelism, inspired by domain decomposition methods in classical
numerical models. Additionally, FourCastNet 3 enables rapid inference on a
single GPU, producing a 90-day global forecast at 0.25{\deg}, 6-hourly
resolution in under 20 seconds. Its computational efficiency, medium-range
probabilistic skill, spectral fidelity, and rollout stability at subseasonal
timescales make it a strong candidate for improving meteorological forecasting
and early warning systems through large ensemble predictions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM is a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for deploying foundation models (FMs) on edge devices, reducing communication and computation overhead with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models (FMs) face challenges in edge deployment due to high communication and computation demands. PRISM aims to address these issues for practical edge use.

Method: PRISM uses Segment Means to approximate intermediate features, restructures self-attention to avoid redundant computations, and introduces partition-aware causal masking for autoregressive models.

Result: PRISM reduces communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT) with minor accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: PRISM provides a scalable and practical solution for deploying FMs in resource-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range
of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but
pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing
interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing
foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a
communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer
inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation
to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device
communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to
eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in
position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme
tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2
across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and
CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead
(up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation
(51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation.
This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation
models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces GMRF MCVAE, a novel generative model using Gaussian Markov Random Fields to improve multi-component data generation by capturing intricate dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-component generative models often oversimplify dependencies, leading to poor structural coherence in generated outputs.

Method: The GMRF MCVAE embeds Gaussian Markov Random Fields into prior and posterior distributions to explicitly model cross-component relationships.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior structural coherence.

Conclusion: GMRF MCVAE is highly effective for applications requiring realistic modeling of multi-component coherence.

Abstract: Multi-component datasets with intricate dependencies, like industrial
assemblies or multi-modal imaging, challenge current generative modeling
techniques. Existing Multi-component Variational AutoEncoders typically rely on
simplified aggregation strategies, neglecting critical nuances and consequently
compromising structural coherence across generated components. To explicitly
address this gap, we introduce the Gaussian Markov Random Field Multi-Component
Variational AutoEncoder , a novel generative framework embedding Gaussian
Markov Random Fields into both prior and posterior distributions. This design
choice explicitly models cross-component relationships, enabling richer
representation and faithful reproduction of complex interactions. Empirically,
our GMRF MCVAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a synthetic Copula
dataset specifically constructed to evaluate intricate component relationships,
demonstrates competitive results on the PolyMNIST benchmark, and significantly
enhances structural coherence on the real-world BIKED dataset. Our results
indicate that the GMRF MCVAE is especially suited for practical applications
demanding robust and realistic modeling of multi-component coherence

*Xiucheng Wang,Qiming Zhang,Nan Cheng,Junting Chen,Zezhong Zhang,Zan Li,Shuguang Cui,Xuemin Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanRadio3D introduces a large-scale 3D radio map dataset and a diffusion-model-based framework, RadioDiff-3D, to address limitations in existing 2D methods by including pathloss, DoA, and ToA metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing radio map methods focus on 2D pathloss prediction, neglecting key parameters like DoA, ToA, and vertical variations, limiting generalization.

Method: Proposes UrbanRadio3D, a 3D dataset via ray tracing, and RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based framework with 3D convolutional architecture.

Result: RadioDiff-3D outperforms in constructing high-dimensional radio maps, validated on UrbanRadio3D.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for 3D environment-aware communication research.

Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling
environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial
distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM
construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely
on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as
direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial
variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static
learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data
distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a
large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in
realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than
previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA,
forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than
prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet
with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce
RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D
convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware
scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based
on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate
that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich,
high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work
provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D
environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of explaining evidential clustering results, proposing the IEMM algorithm for interpretable decision tree explanations, validated with high satisfaction rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with imperfect real-world data; evidential clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, is explored for explainability in high-stakes domains like healthcare.

Method: The paper introduces representativity as a key condition for decision trees, generalizes it with utility functions for partial labeling, and proposes the IEMM algorithm for cautious explanations.

Result: The IEMM algorithm achieved satisfactory explanations up to 93% of the time, validated on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The work advances explainability in evidential clustering, offering practical and interpretable solutions for high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Unsupervised classification is a fundamental machine learning problem.
Real-world data often contain imperfections, characterized by uncertainty and
imprecision, which are not well handled by traditional methods. Evidential
clustering, based on Dempster-Shafer theory, addresses these challenges. This
paper explores the underexplored problem of explaining evidential clustering
results, which is crucial for high-stakes domains such as healthcare. Our
analysis shows that, in the general case, representativity is a necessary and
sufficient condition for decision trees to serve as abductive explainers.
Building on the concept of representativity, we generalize this idea to
accommodate partial labeling through utility functions. These functions enable
the representation of "tolerable" mistakes, leading to the definition of
evidential mistakeness as explanation cost and the construction of explainers
tailored to evidential classifiers. Finally, we propose the Iterative
Evidential Mistake Minimization (IEMM) algorithm, which provides interpretable
and cautious decision tree explanations for evidential clustering functions. We
validate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world data. Taking into
account the decision-maker's preferences, we were able to provide an
explanation that was satisfactory up to 93% of the time.

*Nikolaos Louloudakis,Ajitha Rajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TuneQn is a suite for selective quantization of ONNX models, optimizing performance and size across CPUs and GPUs, reducing accuracy loss by up to 54.14% and model size by 72.9%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fully quantized models often suffer from accuracy loss and deployment challenges on low-end hardware, necessitating selective quantization.

Method: TuneQn selectively quantizes ONNX models, deploys them on various hardware, profiles performance, and uses multi-objective optimization to identify optimal models.

Result: TuneQn reduced accuracy loss by up to 54.14% and model size by 72.9% compared to fully quantized and original models, respectively.

Conclusion: TuneQn effectively balances accuracy and model size through selective quantization, making it practical for deployment on diverse hardware.

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network
models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of
accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance
below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware
accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues,
quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but
selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose
TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of
ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and
multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX
models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics
like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best
model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings
across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility
effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model
candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the
fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the
original model.

*Tomohisa Okazaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces a physics-informed linear model (PILM) for solving PDEs and estimating coefficients or boundary conditions, comparing physical and mathematical regularization, with Bayesian analysis favoring the latter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of solving PDEs and estimating their parameters from data, leveraging a linear model for analytical solutions and comparing regularization methods.

Method: Developed PILM using linear combinations of basis functions for analytical solutions, tested on forward/inverse problems, and applied to crustal strain rate estimation with geodetic data.

Result: Mathematical regularization outperformed physical regularization in Bayesian analysis. PILM proved effective for linear problems, underdetermined systems, and regularization.

Conclusion: PILM offers an analytically solvable framework for linear PDE problems, with mathematical regularization showing superior performance in Bayesian contexts.

Abstract: Many physical systems are described by partial differential equations (PDEs),
and solving these equations and estimating their coefficients or boundary
conditions (BCs) from observational data play a crucial role in understanding
the associated phenomena. Recently, a machine learning approach known as
physics-informed neural network, which solves PDEs using neural networks by
minimizing the sum of residuals from the PDEs, BCs, and data, has gained
significant attention in the scientific community. In this study, we
investigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear
combinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an
analytical representation of optimal solutions. The PILM was formulated and
verified for illustrative forward and inverse problems including cases with
uncertain BCs. Furthermore, the PILM was applied to estimate crustal strain
rates using geodetic data. Specifically, physical regularization that enforces
elastic equilibrium on the velocity fields was compared with mathematical
regularization that imposes smoothness constraints. From a Bayesian
perspective, mathematical regularization exhibited superior performance. The
PILM provides an analytically solvable framework applicable to linear forward
and inverse problems, underdetermined systems, and physical regularization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper argues that optimizers in deep learning not only affect convergence rates but also shape the qualitative properties of learned solutions, advocating for a shift in focus from efficiency to understanding and designing optimizers for desired solution traits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation stems from the observation that while DNNs have succeeded despite early skepticism, the community overly focuses on convex optimization mental models, neglecting how optimizers influence solution properties.

Method: The paper does not propose a specific method but critiques current perspectives and advocates for research into optimizer biases and their impact on model solutions.

Result: The result is a call to action for the community to study and design optimizers that encode specific inductive biases and desired solution properties.

Conclusion: The conclusion emphasizes the importance of optimizer design as a critical factor alongside architecture and data in shaping model outcomes, urging a broader research focus.

Abstract: Due to the nonlinear nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), one can not
guarantee convergence to a unique global minimum of the loss when using
optimizers relying only on local information, such as SGD. Indeed, this was a
primary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early
days of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed
this skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows
that sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit
well-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This
success has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model
for learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of
required iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We
argue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another
perspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the
optimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative
properties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will
encode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class
of models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of
encoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community
should aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as
aim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain
properties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their
convergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our
understanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we
converge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a
critical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping
model outcomes.

TL;DR: A robust causal discovery method leveraging power-law spectral features to improve accuracy in noisy, real-world time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high sensitivity to noise in existing causal discovery algorithms, which leads to misleading inferences in real data.

Method: Extracts power-law spectral features from time series to amplify genuine causal signals, exploiting the self-organizing behavior observed in real-world data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures.

Conclusion: The proposed method is robust and practically relevant for causal discovery in noisy, real-world time series.

Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet
crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics,
neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD)
have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise,
resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this
paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series
follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing
behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the
extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals.
Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both
synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures,
demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer
sensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from
text representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We
address this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information
related to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving
as much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach
involves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to
make the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to
erase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the
projector, we control the extent of information removal, while its
orthogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the
embeddings. Our method, termed $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves
state-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on
classic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that $\overline{\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear
classifiers, thereby promoting fairness.

*Zachary James,Joseph Guinness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for nonstationary Gaussian processes using neural networks to model kernel parameters, improving flexibility and accuracy over stationary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stationary kernels in Gaussian processes limit expressiveness and may not suit many datasets. Nonstationary kernels, with parameters varying across feature space, offer a solution.

Method: Nonstationary kernel parameters are modeled via a neural network trained jointly with the Gaussian process using derivatives. Compatible with approximation methods for scalability.

Result: Outperforms stationary and hierarchical models in accuracy and log-score on machine learning datasets. Recovers nonstationary parameters in spatial data.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances Gaussian process flexibility and performance, adapting easily to various nonstationary kernels without redesigning optimization.

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression
because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they
often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and
may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses
nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling
these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as
input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the
chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior
of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods
for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different
nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure.
Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily
modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on
several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and
log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated
with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only
nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover
the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

*Yuan-Chen Shu,Zhiwei Lin,Yongtao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RegCL is a non-replay continual learning framework for multi-domain knowledge integration via model merging, addressing catastrophic forgetting in SAM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adapter-based methods for SAM suffer from domain specificity and catastrophic forgetting, limiting scalability.

Method: RegCL merges parameters of domain-specific adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA) using weight optimization to minimize prediction discrepancies.

Result: RegCL maintains parameter efficiency and achieves strong continual learning performance across multiple domains.

Conclusion: RegCL effectively integrates multi-domain knowledge without replay or increased model size, proving scalable and efficient.

Abstract: To address the performance limitations of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in
specific domains, existing works primarily adopt adapter-based one-step
adaptation paradigms. However, some of these methods are specific developed for
specific domains. If used on other domains may lead to performance degradation.
This issue of catastrophic forgetting severely limits the model's scalability.
To address this issue, this paper proposes RegCL, a novel non-replay continual
learning (CL) framework designed for efficient multi-domain knowledge
integration through model merging. Specifically, RegCL incorporates the model
merging algorithm into the continual learning paradigm by merging the
parameters of SAM's adaptation modules (e.g., LoRA modules) trained on
different domains. The merging process is guided by weight optimization, which
minimizes prediction discrepancies between the merged model and each of the
domain-specific models. RegCL effectively consolidates multi-domain knowledge
while maintaining parameter efficiency, i.e., the model size remains constant
regardless of the number of tasks, and no historical data storage is required.
Experimental results demonstrate that RegCL achieves favorable continual
learning performance across multiple downstream datasets, validating its
effectiveness in dynamic scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel prompt-based method for online continual learning is proposed, addressing data privacy and catastrophic forgetting with fewer parameters and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data privacy constraints in online continual learning complicate catastrophic forgetting, and existing methods either violate privacy or increase parameter size.

Method: The method includes a lightweight prompt generator, trainable scaler-shifter, pre-trained model preservation, and hard-soft updates.

Result: Outperforms SOTAs on CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB datasets with fewer parameters and moderate training/inference time.

Conclusion: The proposed method is efficient and effective for online continual learning, with code available for further study.

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the
data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in
streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with
the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be
replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach
performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing
number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in
practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue
of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a
novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main
components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge,
(2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model
(PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our
proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current
SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity
analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of
parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Thought Purity (TP), a defense paradigm against Chain-of-Thought Attacks (CoTA) in reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhancing security without compromising performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs like Deepseek-R1 are vulnerable to security threats, especially in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where adversarial attacks (e.g., backdoor prompts) can undermine reasoning.

Method: Proposes TP with three components: safety-optimized data processing, reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints, and adaptive monitoring metrics.

Result: TP effectively defends against CoTA, balancing security and functionality in LRMs.

Conclusion: TP is a pioneering defense mechanism for securing next-generation AI architectures against CoTA vulnerabilities.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g.,
Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large
Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains
a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like
backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning
mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this
vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously
degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To
address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought
Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to
malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves
this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data
processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3)
adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive
defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement
learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the
security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Conclusion: This work advances topological deep learning by providing scalable and expressive representations, opening new possibilities for molecular classification and property prediction.

Abstract: Topological neural networks have emerged as powerful successors of graph
neural networks. However, they typically involve higher-order message passing,
which incurs significant computational expense. We circumvent this issue with a
novel topological framework that introduces a Laplacian operator on
combinatorial complexes (CCs), enabling efficient computation of heat kernels
that serve as node descriptors. Our approach captures multiscale information
and enables permutation-equivariant representations, allowing easy integration
into modern transformer-based architectures.
  Theoretically, the proposed method is maximally expressive because it can
distinguish arbitrary non-isomorphic CCs. Empirically, it significantly
outperforms existing topological methods in terms of computational efficiency.
Besides demonstrating competitive performance with the state-of-the-art
descriptors on standard molecular datasets, it exhibits superior capability in
distinguishing complex topological structures and avoiding blind spots on
topological benchmarks. Overall, this work advances topological deep learning
by providing expressive yet scalable representations, thereby opening up
exciting avenues for molecular classification and property prediction tasks.

### [212] [Improving Reinforcement Learning Sample-Efficiency using Local Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12383)
*Mohit Prashant,Arvind Easwaran*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper derives sharper PAC bounds for RL in infinite-horizon MDPs, reducing sample complexity by a logarithmic factor to O(SA log A).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PAC bounds for RL in MDPs are suboptimal. The study aims to improve sample complexity by leveraging state transition dependencies.

Method: Approximates the original MDP using smaller MDPs with subsets of the state-space, extending results to a model-free setting with a PAC-MDP algorithm.

Result: Achieves a sample complexity of O(SA log A), a logarithmic improvement over prior work, validated experimentally.

Conclusion: The proposed method significantly improves sample complexity, demonstrating practical benefits over existing approaches.

Abstract: In this study, we derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds on the
asymptotic sample-complexity for RL within the infinite-horizon Markov Decision
Process (MDP) setting that are sharper than those in existing literature. The
premise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each
other, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when
learning the $\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of
'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\epsilon$-optimal
value of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the
$\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of
transitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity
have values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number
of samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs
constructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce
the sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \log A)$ timesteps,
where $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes. We are able to extend
these results to an infinite-horizon, model-free setting by constructing a
PAC-MDP algorithm with the aforementioned sample-complexity. We conclude with
showing how significant the improvement is by comparing our algorithm against
prior work in an experimental setting.

*Bo Wen,Guoyun Gao,Zhicheng Xu,Ruibin Mao,Xiaojuan Qi,X. Sharon Hu,Xunzhao Yin,Can Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hardware-software co-design using $MoS_2$ Flash-based analog CAM with soft boundaries improves robustness and accuracy in tree-based models, addressing interpretability and scalability issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing concerns about AI trustworthiness, particularly interpretability and robustness, while overcoming computational inefficiencies in tree-based models.

Method: A novel approach using $MoS_2$ Flash-based analog CAM with soft boundaries for efficient inference in soft tree-based models.

Result: Achieves 96% accuracy on WDBC, maintains explainability, and shows only 0.6% accuracy drop under device variation (vs. 45.3% for traditional trees).

Conclusion: This method enhances AI trustworthiness and efficiency, paving the way for specialized hardware solutions.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised concerns
regarding its trustworthiness, especially in terms of interpretability and
robustness. Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost excel in
interpretability and accuracy for tabular data, but scaling them remains
computationally expensive due to poor data locality and high data dependence.
Previous efforts to accelerate these models with analog content addressable
memory (CAM) have struggled, due to the fact that the difficult-to-implement
sharp decision boundaries are highly susceptible to device variations, which
leads to poor hardware performance and vulnerability to adversarial attacks.
This work presents a novel hardware-software co-design approach using $MoS_2$
Flash-based analog CAM with inherent soft boundaries, enabling efficient
inference with soft tree-based models. Our soft tree model inference
experiments on $MoS_2$ analog CAM arrays show this method achieves exceptional
robustness against device variation and adversarial attacks while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Specifically, our fabricated analog CAM arrays
achieve $96\%$ accuracy on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) database,
while maintaining decision explainability. Our experimentally calibrated model
validated only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop on the MNIST dataset under $10\%$ device
threshold variation, compared to a $45.3\%$ drop for traditional decision
trees. This work paves the way for specialized hardware that enhances AI's
trustworthiness and efficiency.

*Florian E. Dorner,Yatong Chen,André F. Cruz,Fanny Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how verifier imperfection impacts test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling, linking performance to the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap in theoretical understanding of how imperfect verifiers affect test-time scaling techniques in language models.

Method: Theoretical analysis of BoN and rejection sampling, focusing on the verifier's ROC curve geometry, supported by experiments on GSM8K using Llama and Qwen models.

Result: Rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed compute, but both methods converge to the same accuracy in the infinite-compute limit, determined by the ROC curve's slope near the origin.

Conclusion: Verifier imperfection's impact on test-time scaling is precisely characterized by ROC curve geometry, with practical implications for method selection based on compute constraints.

Abstract: Test-time scaling aims to improve language model performance by leveraging
additional compute during inference. While many works have empirically studied
techniques like Best-of-N (BoN) and rejection sampling that make use of a
verifier to enable test-time scaling, there is little theoretical understanding
of how verifier imperfection affects performance. In this work, we address this
gap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is
precisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.
Interestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC
curve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve
for BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to
extrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute
regime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed
compute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level
of accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin. Our
theoretical results are confirmed by experiments on GSM8K using different
versions of Llama and Qwen to generate and verify solutions.

### [215] [NOCTA: Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition for Longitudinal Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12412)
*Dzung Dinh,Boqi Chen,Marc Niethammer,Junier Oliva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOCTA is a method for cost-efficient feature acquisition in temporal prediction tasks, outperforming baselines with its non-greedy, cost-aware approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Resource constraints in critical applications like healthcare require efficient feature acquisition, balancing information gain with costs.

Method: NOCTA introduces two estimators: a non-parametric nearest-neighbor method (NOCTA-NP) and a parametric utility predictor (NOCTA-P).

Result: Both NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines on synthetic and real-world medical datasets.

Conclusion: NOCTA effectively addresses the challenge of cost-aware feature acquisition in dynamic settings.

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of
information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in
healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to
imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be
acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover,
temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over
time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is
important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff
Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at
inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition
cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,
and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based
on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric
method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).
Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both
NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Mixture of Raytraced Experts (MoE) architecture dynamically selects expert sequences, enabling variable computation depth and width for improved accuracy without fixed computation per sample.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MoE architectures require fixed computation per sample, limiting flexibility and efficiency. This work aims to enable dynamic computation for better accuracy and training efficiency.

Method: The model iteratively samples from candidate experts, unfolding sequences like Recurrent Neural Networks, avoiding load-balancing mechanisms.

Result: Preliminary experiments show 10%-40% fewer training epochs with comparable/higher accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach opens new research directions for faster, more expressive MoE models, with code publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts
(MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing
computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures
generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our
approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the
computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by
iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence
akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require
load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in
training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These
results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the
design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available

*Yi Li,David Mccoy,Nolan Gunter,Kaitlyn Lee,Alejandro Schuler,Mark van der Laan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA) embeds TMLE into neural networks for unbiased causal inference, improving bias and coverage in multi-parameter settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural implementations for causal inference lack guarantees or are computationally expensive, especially for multi-parameter settings.

Method: TDA partitions model parameters, freezing most and iteratively updating a small subset along a targeting gradient derived from influence functions.

Result: TDA reduces bias and improves coverage in benchmarks like IHDP and simulated survival data.

Conclusion: TDA provides a scalable, rigorous pathway for causal inference in deep learning, especially for complex targets.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks are powerful predictive tools yet often lack
valid inference for causal parameters, such as treatment effects or entire
survival curves. While frameworks like Double Machine Learning (DML) and
Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) can debias machine-learning fits,
existing neural implementations either rely on "targeted losses" that do not
guarantee solving the efficient influence function equation or computationally
expensive post-hoc "fluctuations" for multi-parameter settings. We propose
Targeted Deep Architectures (TDA), a new framework that embeds TMLE directly
into the network's parameter space with no restrictions on the backbone
architecture. Specifically, TDA partitions model parameters - freezing all but
a small "targeting" subset - and iteratively updates them along a targeting
gradient, derived from projecting the influence functions onto the span of the
gradients of the loss with respect to weights. This procedure yields plug-in
estimates that remove first-order bias and produce asymptotically valid
confidence intervals. Crucially, TDA easily extends to multi-dimensional causal
estimands (e.g., entire survival curves) by merging separate targeting
gradients into a single universal targeting update. Theoretically, TDA inherits
classical TMLE properties, including double robustness and semiparametric
efficiency. Empirically, on the benchmark IHDP dataset (average treatment
effects) and simulated survival data with informative censoring, TDA reduces
bias and improves coverage relative to both standard neural-network estimators
and prior post-hoc approaches. In doing so, TDA establishes a direct, scalable
pathway toward rigorous causal inference within modern deep architectures for
complex multi-parameter targets.

*Daniel Commey,Rebecca A. Sarpong,Griffith S. Klogo,Winful Bagyl-Bac,Garth V. Crosby*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A proactive, economic defense for federated learning (FL) using a Bayesian incentive mechanism to deter data-poisoning attacks by making malicious behavior economically irrational.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FL's open-participation nature makes it vulnerable to data-poisoning attacks, and existing defenses are reactive and computationally expensive.

Method: A lightweight Bayesian incentive mechanism where the server verifies updates using a private validation dataset before issuing payments, ensuring IR and IC.

Result: Maintains 96.7% accuracy with 50% label-flipping adversaries, outperforming FedAvg by 51.7 percentage points.

Conclusion: The mechanism is robust, computationally efficient, and easily integrable into FL frameworks, providing a practical defense against poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients while preserving data privacy. However, its
open-participation nature exposes it to data-poisoning attacks, in which
malicious actors submit corrupted model updates to degrade the global model.
Existing defenses are often reactive, relying on statistical aggregation rules
that can be computationally expensive and that typically assume an honest
majority. This paper introduces a proactive, economic defense: a lightweight
Bayesian incentive mechanism that makes malicious behavior economically
irrational. Each training round is modeled as a Bayesian game of incomplete
information in which the server, acting as the principal, uses a small, private
validation dataset to verify update quality before issuing payments. The design
satisfies Individual Rationality (IR) for benevolent clients, ensuring their
participation is profitable, and Incentive Compatibility (IC), making poisoning
an economically dominated strategy. Extensive experiments on non-IID partitions
of MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate robustness: with 50% label-flipping
adversaries on MNIST, the mechanism maintains 96.7% accuracy, only 0.3
percentage points lower than in a scenario with 30% label-flipping adversaries.
This outcome is 51.7 percentage points better than standard FedAvg, which
collapses under the same 50% attack. The mechanism is computationally light,
budget-bounded, and readily integrates into existing FL frameworks, offering a
practical route to economically robust and sustainable FL ecosystems.

### [219] [Cost-aware Stopping for Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12453)
*Qian Xie,Linda Cai,Alexander Terenin,Peter I. Frazier,Ziv Scully*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization is proposed, ensuring efficient function evaluation without excessive costs, backed by theoretical guarantees and outperforming other methods in experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of guarantees in adaptive stopping rules for Bayesian optimization in cost-aware settings, ensuring efficient and cost-effective evaluations.

Method: Develops a stopping rule adapting to varying evaluation costs, grounded in theoretical connections to cost-aware acquisition functions (PBGI and log expected improvement per cost).

Result: Theoretical guarantees bound evaluation costs, and experiments show superior performance in cost-adjusted simple regret for tasks like hyperparameter optimization.

Conclusion: The proposed stopping rule, especially with PBGI, offers a reliable and efficient solution for cost-aware Bayesian optimization.

Abstract: In automated machine learning, scientific discovery, and other applications
of Bayesian optimization, deciding when to stop evaluating expensive black-box
functions is an important practical consideration. While several adaptive
stopping rules have been proposed, in the cost-aware setting they lack
guarantees ensuring they stop before incurring excessive function evaluation
costs. We propose a cost-aware stopping rule for Bayesian optimization that
adapts to varying evaluation costs and is free of heuristic tuning. Our rule is
grounded in a theoretical connection to state-of-the-art cost-aware acquisition
functions, namely the Pandora's Box Gittins Index (PBGI) and log expected
improvement per cost. We prove a theoretical guarantee bounding the expected
cumulative evaluation cost incurred by our stopping rule when paired with these
two acquisition functions. In experiments on synthetic and empirical tasks,
including hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture size search, we
show that combining our stopping rule with the PBGI acquisition function
consistently matches or outperforms other acquisition-function--stopping-rule
pairs in terms of cost-adjusted simple regret, a metric capturing trade-offs
between solution quality and cumulative evaluation cost.

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic (HDVs and CAVs) to improve safety, efficiency, and fuel economy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address traffic congestion and accidents in highway on-ramp merging areas, especially during the transition to widespread CAV adoption.

Method: Extends car-following and lane-changing models, introduces a HCOMC framework with hierarchical planning, game theory-based lane-changing, and multi-objective optimization.

Result: HCOMC outperforms benchmarks in safety, merging efficiency, traffic flow stability, and fuel savings under varying traffic densities and CAV penetration rates.

Conclusion: HCOMC is a viable solution for improving merging performance in mixed traffic environments.

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion
and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and
automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs
are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative
on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on
two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal
car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral
lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for
human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human
factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a
HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based
on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model
based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the
elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and
efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under
different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The
findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in
enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging
process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption
compared with benchmarks.

goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by
highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and

TL;DR: The paper proposes using deep generative models to improve autonomous vehicle safety at intersections by generating collision-causing noise sequences and distilling them into a fast single-step model for robust planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intersections are high-risk zones for collisions, and enhancing autonomous vehicle safety in such contexts is critical.

Method: A 1000-step denoising diffusion probabilistic model is trained to generate collision-causing noise sequences, then distilled into a single-step model using a generative adversarial architecture.

Result: The single-step model enables fast inference and is applied to a robust planner, reducing failure and delay rates in simulations compared to a baseline controller.

Conclusion: The approach effectively improves autonomous vehicle safety at intersections through efficient failure case sampling and robust planning.

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of
collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety
of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step
denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor
noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection
based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the
generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a
single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed
while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible
application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the
autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently
sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to
inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner
demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the
baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Motivation: The rapid rise of micromobility (e-scooters, e-bikes) demands reliable AR technologies, but current systems face unique challenges like instability and unpredictable environments, raising safety concerns.

Method: The review systematically analyzes AR components (perception, planning, control) through the lens of AD, identifying gaps in perception, industry support, and research focus.

Result: Key gaps include inadequate perception systems, limited support, and insufficient research attention. Promising directions include multimodal sensors and edge deep learning.

Conclusion: By bridging AD insights with AR needs, the review aims to advance safe, efficient, and scalable AR systems for urban mobility.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of micromobility solutions, particularly two-wheeled
vehicles like e-scooters and e-bikes, has created an urgent need for reliable
autonomous riding (AR) technologies. While autonomous driving (AD) systems have
matured significantly, AR presents unique challenges due to the inherent
instability of two-wheeled platforms, limited size, limited power, and
unpredictable environments, which pose very serious concerns about road users'
safety. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of AR systems by
systematically examining their core components, perception, planning, and
control, through the lens of AD technologies. We identify critical gaps in
current AR research, including a lack of comprehensive perception systems for
various AR tasks, limited industry and government support for such
developments, and insufficient attention from the research community. The
review analyses the gaps of AR from the perspective of AD to highlight
promising research directions, such as multimodal sensor techniques for
lightweight platforms and edge deep learning architectures. By synthesising
insights from AD research with the specific requirements of AR, this review
aims to accelerate the development of safe, efficient, and scalable autonomous

*Hao Chen,Takuya Kiyokawa,Zhengtao Hu,Weiwei Wan,Kensuke Harada*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel similarity matching method for grasping unknown objects from a single view, using known objects for guidance and optimizing grasp quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of learning-based approaches in grasping unknown objects due to sensitivity to noise and environmental changes.

Method: Leverages visual features for similarity matching, uses pre-existing grasping knowledge for imitative grasps, and optimizes grasp quality through fine-tuning. Introduces multi-level similarity matching and a C-FPFH descriptor for accurate assessment.

Result: Proposes a robust framework for unknown-object grasping, integrating semantic, geometric, and dimensional features.

Conclusion: The method enhances grasping robustness by abandoning traditional learning frameworks and focusing on similarity matching and optimization.

Abstract: Grasping unknown objects from a single view has remained a challenging topic
in robotics due to the uncertainty of partial observation. Recent advances in
large-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.
However, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in
performance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental
changes. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,
we abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:
similarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the
grasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly
achieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key
steps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform
similarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,
identifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate
models with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the
unknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local
fine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy
observation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that
integrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive
evaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,
the C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between
partial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database
models. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce
the semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration
approach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under
single-view conditions. Videos are available at https://youtu.be/qQDIELMhQmk.

Motivation: Overcoming the scalability limitations of real robot data collection by leveraging abundant and diverse human videos for imitation learning.

Method: Train VLA models on human videos, convert human actions to robot actions via Inverse Kinematics, and fine-tune with minimal robot demonstrations.

Result: EgoVLA shows significant improvements over baselines in the Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark.

Conclusion: Human videos are a viable and rich alternative to robot data for training robotic manipulation policies, as demonstrated by EgoVLA.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant
advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot
hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this
paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric
human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but
more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on
human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse
Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We
fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the
robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac
Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation
tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid
Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and
ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website:

Result: Top uMLIPs outperform classical force fields and fine-tuned ML potentials, with data quality (diverse training sets and out-of-equilibrium conformations) being crucial.

Conclusion: uMLIPs are ready for nanoporous materials modeling, and the benchmark framework is released to guide further development and adoption.

Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) have emerged as
powerful tools for accelerating atomistic simulations, offering scalable and
efficient modeling with accuracy close to quantum calculations. However, their
reliability and effectiveness in practical, real-world applications remain an
open question. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and related nanoporous materials
are highly porous crystals with critical relevance in carbon capture, energy
storage, and catalysis applications. Modeling nanoporous materials presents
distinct challenges for uMLIPs due to their diverse chemistry, structural
complexity, including porosity and coordination bonds, and the absence from
existing training datasets. Here, we introduce MOFSimBench, a benchmark to
evaluate uMLIPs on key materials modeling tasks for nanoporous materials,
including structural optimization, molecular dynamics (MD) stability, the
prediction of bulk properties, such as bulk modulus and heat capacity, and
guest-host interactions. Evaluating over 20 models from various architectures
on a chemically and structurally diverse materials set, we find that
top-performing uMLIPs consistently outperform classical force fields and
fine-tuned machine learning potentials across all tasks, demonstrating their
readiness for deployment in nanoporous materials modeling. Our analysis
highlights that data quality, particularly the diversity of training sets and
inclusion of out-of-equilibrium conformations, plays a more critical role than
model architecture in determining performance across all evaluated uMLIPs. We
release our modular and extendable benchmarking framework at
https://github.com/AI4ChemS/mofsim-bench, providing an open resource to guide
the adoption for nanoporous materials modeling and further development of
uMLIPs.

### [227] [Universal Fourier Neural Operators for Micromechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12233)
*Binh Huy Nguyen,Matti Schneider*

Main category: cs.CE

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for solving micromechanical cell problems, inspired by FFT-based methods, achieving high accuracy and efficiency without material symmetry or geometry restrictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-learning frameworks lack the speed and generality of traditional computational methods for cell problems in homogenization, and it's unclear which machine-learning approaches are promising.

Method: The authors construct an FNO surrogate mimicking FFT-based methods, ensuring it predicts solutions for arbitrary stiffness distributions under material-contrast constraints.

Result: The FNO achieves sharp, uniform fidelity, handles large-scale problems (100M+ voxels), and matches the runtime of classical FFT solvers.

Conclusion: FNOs show great potential for micromechanics, bridging FFT-based methods and neural operators, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration.

Abstract: \noindent Solving cell problems in homogenization is hard, and available
deep-learning frameworks fail to match the speed and generality of traditional
computational frameworks. More to the point, it is generally unclear what to
expect of machine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches
are promising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)
for micromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational
micromechanics methods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct
an FNO surrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods
and show that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with
\emph{arbitrary} stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast
constraint up to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions
on the material symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the
geometry of the interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is
sharp and uniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical
empowerment of FNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we
construct an FNO explicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the
obtained neural operator complies with the same memory requirements as the
basic scheme and comes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In
particular, large-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily
handled. The goal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for
solving micromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs. This
connection is expected to provide a fruitful exchange between both worlds.

*Jikang Deng,Fizza Hassan,Hui Zhou,Saad Al-Ahmadi,Mohamed-Slim Alouini,Daniel B. Da Costa*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper explores integrating ORAN principles into NTN to address DevOps challenges, proposing an ORAN-based NTN framework for scalable and intelligent network management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient, reliable, and flexible wireless networks in 6G, coupled with NTN's coverage and resilience benefits, but hindered by AI and scalability challenges in DevOps.

Method: Proposes an ORAN-based NTN framework, detailing features like flexible fronthaul split, enhanced RICs for distributed learning, scalable deployment, and multi-domain service management.

Result: A holistic framework combining ORAN and NTN to address scalability and intelligence gaps in network management.

Conclusion: The ORAN-based NTN framework offers a promising solution, with future research directions and use cases identified for further exploration.

Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications
have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient,
reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures,
the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have
received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the
deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves
the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN
present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle,
hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native
artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in
disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works
propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN
deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a
holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps
lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses
the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first
provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the
state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges
that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based
NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These
include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent
controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment
architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research
directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other
enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are
highlighted.

### [229] [LLM-Based Config Synthesis requires Disambiguation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12443)
*Rajdeep Mondal,Nikolaj Bjorner,Todd Millstein,Alan Tang,George Varghese*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper addresses ambiguity in user intent for LLM-based program synthesis, particularly in networking configurations like route-maps and ACLs. It proposes Clarify, a system with a Disambiguator module to resolve ambiguities and verify synthesized policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ambiguity in user intent for LLM-based synthesis, especially in networking configurations with overlapping header spaces, leads to incorrect priority inferences without user interaction.

Method: Introduces Clarify, a prototype system with a Disambiguator module to elicit user intent, incrementally synthesize routing policies, and verify them.

Result: Demonstrates ambiguity in real-world cloud ACLs with 100s of overlaps. Clarify successfully synthesizes and verifies policies in a synthetic workload.

Conclusion: Clarify effectively resolves ambiguities in LLM-based synthesis, applicable beyond networking to cases where intent integration is ambiguous.

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is
ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking
context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and
ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative
priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction.
Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps,
showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify,
which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps
elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally
synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our
treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates
can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and
can lead to different global behaviors.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we present enhanced analysis for sign-based optimization
algorithms with momentum updates. Traditional sign-based methods, under the
separable smoothness assumption, guarantee a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$, but they either require large batch sizes or assume
unimodal symmetric stochastic noise. To address these limitations, we
demonstrate that signSGD with momentum can achieve the same convergence rate
using constant batch sizes without additional assumptions. Our analysis, under
the standard $l_2$-smoothness condition, improves upon the result of the prior
momentum-based signSGD method by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2})$, where $d$
is the problem dimension. Furthermore, we explore sign-based methods with
majority vote in distributed settings and show that the proposed momentum-based
method yields convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( d^{1/2}T^{-1/2} +
dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \max \{ d^{1/4}T^{-1/4},
d^{1/10}T^{-1/5} \} \right)$, which outperform the previous results of
$\mathcal{O}\left( dT^{-1/4} + dn^{-1/2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left(
d^{3/8}T^{-1/8} \right)$, respectively. Numerical experiments further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

*Atharva Naik,Lawanya Baghel,Dhakshin Govindarajan,Darsh Agrawal,Daniel Fried,Carolyn Rose*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MetaLint is an instruction-following framework for code quality analysis, outperforming traditional methods by adapting to novel code patterns without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with code quality analysis due to static training data, limiting adaptability to evolving best practices.

Method: MetaLint uses instruction tuning on synthetic linter-generated data for easy-to-hard generalization, avoiding static rule-based training.

Result: MetaLint achieves 70.37% F-score on idiom detection and 26.73% on localization, competitive with larger models.

Conclusion: MetaLint demonstrates strong generalization and adaptability, making it promising for future-proof code quality analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with
code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and
can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, a new
instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the
task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms
based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train
models on static, rule-based data, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on
synthetic linter-generated data to support easy-to-hard generalization,
enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining.
To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by
real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and
assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize.
Our results show that MetaLint improves generalization to unseen PEP idioms,
achieving a 70.37% F-score on idiom detection with the highest recall (70.43%)
among all evaluated models. It also achieves 26.73% on localization,
competitive for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art
models like o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of LLMs overlook code quality and real-world performance, especially in non-English languages like Russian.

Method: MERA Code includes 11 tasks spanning 8 programming languages, a taxonomy of coding skills, an open-source codebase, and a scoring system.

Result: The benchmark evaluates open and frontier LLMs, revealing limitations in practical coding tasks for non-English languages.

Conclusion: MERA Code aims to guide research, anticipate model advancements, and standardize evaluations for code generation LLMs.

Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering;
however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks,
overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over
executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true
capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address
this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family,
specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in
Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming
languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that
outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these
tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct
MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming
environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We
evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in
terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly
releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in
model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an LLM-driven tool, AI4Pricing2Yaml, to automate SaaS pricing analysis by transforming static HTML pricing into intelligent, machine-readable models, improving efficiency and reducing errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of SaaS has made manual pricing management complex and error-prone, lacking automated tools for analysis and optimization.

Method: An LLM-driven approach with web scraping and LLMs extracts pricing components from SaaS websites, transforming them into intelligent pricing models.

Result: Validated on 30 SaaS sites, the tool effectively extracts pricing elements but faces challenges like hallucinations and dynamic content.

Conclusion: Automating intelligent pricing transformation can streamline SaaS pricing management, with future work aimed at refining extraction and adaptability.

Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering
flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid
expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps
teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that
is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for
pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and
scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing
(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these
challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines
operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in
response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We
present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML
pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while
minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic
Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract
essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from
SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS,
encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's
effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However,
challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic
content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing
transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for
improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing
landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and
enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.

Motivation: Address the lack of execution-based evaluation for code generation adapting to library version updates.

Method: Introduce GitChameleon, a dataset with 328 Python problems, version-specific tests, and evaluate LLMs, agents, and RAG systems.

Result: State-of-the-art systems struggle, with success rates of 48-51%, highlighting the task's complexity.

Conclusion: GitChameleon aids in understanding and improving AI code generation for evolving libraries.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for
code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version
updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution
benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based
evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To
address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset
comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific
library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon
rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs),
LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform
version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy
through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art
systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models
achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the
intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing
the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer
understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more
adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and
evaluation code publicly available at

*Wei Sun,Linhan Cao,Kang Fu,Dandan Zhu,Jun Jia,Menghan Hu,Xiongkuo Min,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: CompressedVQA-HDR is a new VQA framework for HDR video quality assessment, using Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 for FR and NR models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA methods lack generalization for diverse video types, especially HDR content, necessitating a specialized framework.

Method: Uses Swin Transformer for FR (deep structural/textural similarities) and SigLip 2 for NR (global mean features). Pre-trains on SDR data and fine-tunes on HDRSDR-VQA.

Result: State-of-the-art performance; CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place in IEEE ICME 2025 challenge.

Conclusion: CompressedVQA-HDR effectively addresses HDR video quality assessment challenges with superior performance.

Abstract: Video compression is a standard procedure applied to all videos to minimize
storage and transmission demands while preserving visual quality as much as
possible. Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is
crucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video
compression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment
(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability
needed to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high
dynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an
effective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality
assessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the
backbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)
VQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and
textural similarities between reference and distorted frames using
intermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its
quality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global
mean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware
representation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we
pre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA
dataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ
an iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA
datasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental
results show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing FR and NR VQA models. Moreover, CompressedVQA-HDR-FR won first place
in the FR track of the Generalizable HDR & SDR Video Quality Measurement Grand
Challenge at IEEE ICME 2025. The code is available at

*Ekaterina Stansfield,Jennifer A. Mitterer,Abdulrahman Altahhan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining YOLO and SAM improves landmark segmentation in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs by using YOLO's detection to guide SAM's segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose models like SAM lack precision for medical landmark detection, and even MedSAM is not fine-grained enough for orthopaedic landmarks.

Method: YOLO detects landmarks and provides bounding boxes as prompts for SAM, which then segments the structures accurately.

Result: The hybrid model successfully segments 72 landmarks and 16 complex regions, showing excellent performance.

Conclusion: Combining YOLO and SAM creates a reliable pipeline for precise landmark segmentation in orthopaedic imaging.

Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics,
with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for
information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such
as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of
the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the
prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to
recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations
for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has
been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their
parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic
landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another
general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection
and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO
is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in
segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable
pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical
landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex
outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using
YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to
accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the
proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting
anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) improves MR-to-CT synthesis for whole-body imaging by enhancing spatial alignment and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods suffer from poor spatial alignment and insufficient image quality for clinical use.

Method: The 3D-WLDM uses a Wavelet Residual Module and Dual Skip Connection Attention to enhance feature capture and preserve anatomical integrity.

Result: The model generates high-resolution CT images with better bony structure and soft-tissue contrast representation.

Conclusion: The 3D-WLDM addresses key limitations in MR-to-CT synthesis, improving clinical utility.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary
clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic
workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance
(PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are
critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is
typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR
scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis
methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between
the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for
reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D
Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by
performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a
Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the
capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent
spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we
disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the
structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip
Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the
generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony
structures and soft-tissue contrast.

*Lucas Erlacher,Samuel Ruipérez-Campillo,Holger Michel,Sven Wellmann,Thomas M. Sutter,Ece Ozkan,Julia E. Vogt*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) improves pulmonary hypertension (PH) prediction in newborns using echocardiographic videos, outperforming single-view and supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PH in newborns is critical but current echocardiography-based diagnosis is operator-dependent and lacks generalizability. Automated methods for adults are inadequate for newborns.

Method: A multi-view VAE is used to capture complex latent representations from echocardiographic videos, enhancing feature extraction and robustness.

Result: The model shows improved generalization and classification accuracy compared to single-view and supervised approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-view learning with VAE is effective for robust PH assessment in newborns.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized
by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular
strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the
diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive
nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the
operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods
have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view
echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in
newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH
assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we
employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using
echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures
complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We
compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches.
Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment
in newborns.

*Hanxue Gu,Yaqian Chen,Nicholas Konz,Qihang Li,Maciej A. Mazurowski*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Foundation models like SAM outperform traditional methods in breast MRI registration for global alignment but struggle with fine details. Additional medical pre-training doesn't help.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate foundation models' capability in handling complex, deformable breast MRI registration, given their success in simpler tasks.

Method: Tested five pre-trained encoders (DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, MedCLIP) on four breast MRI registration tasks.

Result: SAM-based algorithms excel in global alignment but fail in fine detail capture. Medical pre-training doesn't enhance performance.

Conclusion: Further research is needed to improve fine structure accuracy and understand domain-specific training impacts.

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of
capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for
zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested
in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or
abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more
challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly
difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation
caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal
structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.
Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level
of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a
comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for
breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,
MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that
capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and
patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that
foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional
registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large
domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular
tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or
breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Unsupervised machine learning identifies liver tissue patterns in MRI to quantify treatment response in diffuse liver disease, outperforming non-imaging measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop quantifiable image patterns for disease progression and treatment response, aiding personalized treatment and novel therapy development.

Method: Deep clustering networks encode and cluster liver tissue patches into a low-dimensional latent space to create a tissue vocabulary.

Result: The method identifies treatment-specific liver tissue changes and predicts biopsy-derived features from imaging data, validated on a replication cohort.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised learning approach effectively quantifies treatment response and has potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment
response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for
developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning
can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images
that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering
networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a
low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting
tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver
associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the
vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal
liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method
identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and
enables a better separation between treatment groups than established
non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy
derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a
separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed
method.

TL;DR: A benchmark for detecting and segmenting cortical lesions in MS using MRI, leveraging nnU-Net and multi-centric data, achieving moderate F1-scores and addressing clinical adoption barriers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cortical lesions are key biomarkers in MS but face clinical integration challenges due to subtle MRI appearance and lack of standardized methods.

Method: Used 656 MRI scans from four institutions with expert annotations, adapted nnU-Net for improved detection, and evaluated generalization via out-of-distribution testing.

Result: Achieved F1-scores of 0.64 (in-domain) and 0.5 (out-of-domain), analyzed model features/errors, and studied data variability impacts.

Conclusion: Proposes future recommendations for clinical adoption, with publicly available models and code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Cortical lesions (CLs) have emerged as valuable biomarkers in multiple
sclerosis (MS), offering high diagnostic specificity and prognostic relevance.
However, their routine clinical integration remains limited due to subtle
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance, challenges in expert annotation,
and a lack of standardized automated methods. We propose a comprehensive
multi-centric benchmark of CL detection and segmentation in MRI. A total of 656
MRI scans, including clinical trial and research data from four institutions,
were acquired at 3T and 7T using MP2RAGE and MPRAGE sequences with
expert-consensus annotations. We rely on the self-configuring nnU-Net
framework, designed for medical imaging segmentation, and propose adaptations
tailored to the improved CL detection. We evaluated model generalization
through out-of-distribution testing, demonstrating strong lesion detection
capabilities with an F1-score of 0.64 and 0.5 in and out of the domain,
respectively. We also analyze internal model features and model errors for a
better understanding of AI decision-making. Our study examines how data
variability, lesion ambiguity, and protocol differences impact model
performance, offering future recommendations to address these barriers to
clinical adoption. To reinforce the reproducibility, the implementation and
models will be publicly accessible and ready to use at

TL;DR: UTS is a unit-based tissue segmentation framework using 32x32 tiles for classification, reducing annotation effort and improving efficiency without losing accuracy. It employs a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT) for feature representation and outperforms baselines in breast tissue segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify histopathology segmentation by reducing annotation effort and computational cost while maintaining accuracy, addressing the need for efficient and clinically relevant tissue analysis.

Method: Proposes UTS, a framework classifying fixed-size 32x32 tiles instead of pixels, using a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT) for multi-level feature representation.

Result: Outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, supporting tasks like tumor-stroma quantification.

Conclusion: UTS offers an efficient, accurate solution for histopathology segmentation, with potential clinical applications in tumor analysis and surgical margin assessment.

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology
that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the
segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves
computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this
approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits
the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology
and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three
categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports
clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical
margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&E-stained regions, it
outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset
will be available at GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational costs of numerically solving integro-differential equations for fragmentation modeling.

Method: Uses a neural network to directly map input parameters to the probability density function, bypassing numerical solutions.

Result: Demonstrates computational efficiency and accuracy comparable to or better than finite difference schemes in synthetic data validation.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests broader applicability beyond pre-specified models.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an
integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The
proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability
density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby
significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient
evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining
accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference
schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's
computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a
foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests
the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model
structures.

Motivation: Addressing challenges like information overload and disciplinary silos in science, the paper highlights the potential of LLMs to enhance and lead scientific innovation.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical framework (Evaluator, Collaborator, Scientist) to categorize LLMs' roles, analyzing methodologies, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Offers a systematic synthesis of LLM-driven innovation, clarifying capability boundaries and human-AI interaction patterns.

Conclusion: LLMs are transformative tools and catalysts for science, with the survey providing clarity, guidance, and highlighting ethical challenges.

Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid
advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting
challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing
returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents
capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in
and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus
on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and
discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative
potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive
framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation
across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We
distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research
processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified
taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and
human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of
current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey
delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific
innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing
processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological
foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical
guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also
highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of
increasingly autonomous AI-driven science. Resources related to this survey can

Motivation: To demonstrate unsupervised learning of low-dimensional, semantically rich representations of CDM simulation data for downstream tasks.

Method: Uses flow matching-based generative models (CosmoFlow) to compress field-level CDM data into 32x smaller latent representations.

Result: Achieves interpretable latent representations with distinct channels corresponding to cosmological scales, usable for reconstruction and inference.

Conclusion: CosmoFlow successfully learns compact and meaningful latent representations of CDM data, facilitating various applications in cosmology.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have been demonstrated to be able to learn

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper reveals that fine-tuning AI models can bypass safeguards, creating 'evil twin' models capable of harmful tasks like cyberattacks or criminal activities, highlighting the need for tamper-resistant safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in AI models where fine-tuning can remove safeguards, enabling misuse despite existing moderation systems.

Method: Jailbreak-tuning is used to fine-tune models, teaching them to comply with harmful requests while maintaining high-quality output.

Result: Models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic can be manipulated to perform dangerous tasks, with newer models being more vulnerable.

Conclusion: The study underscores the urgent need for stronger safeguards and warns against releasing fine-tunable models without tamper-resistant protections.

Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers
broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However,
this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed
fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work
which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal
of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches
models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful
requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply
with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal
activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but
also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more
effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in
the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent
ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks,
underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such
safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release
of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally
capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To efficiently train privacy-preserving ViT models with fewer trainable parameters without compromising accuracy.

Method: Inject trainable rank decomposition matrices into each ViT layer and avoid freezing the patch embedding layer.

Result: Reduces trainable parameters while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-time tuning.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient way to adapt ViT models for privacy-preserving tasks with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: We propose a low-rank adaptation method for training privacy-preserving
vision transformer (ViT) models that efficiently freezes pre-trained ViT model
weights. In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are
injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch
embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank
adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number
of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that

TL;DR: The paper highlights poor security awareness and documentation in ML, proposing expanded standards to include security sections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low awareness of security in ML and unstandardized documentation practices necessitate improved security documentation.

Method: Extensive literature review and proposal to expand existing ML documentation standards (Model Cards, Datasheets) with security sections.

Result: Findings reveal gaps in ML-security and documentation quality, with existing standards rarely adopted.

Conclusion: Improved security documentation is needed, and the paper proposes a novel method to integrate security into ML-documentation standards.

Abstract: This article presents the current state of ML-security and of the
documentation of ML-based systems, models and datasets in research and practice
based on an extensive review of the existing literature. It shows a generally
low awareness of security aspects among ML-practitioners and organizations and
an often unstandardized approach to documentation, leading to overall low
quality of ML-documentation. Existing standards are not regularly adopted in
practice and IT-security aspects are often not included in documentation. Due
to these factors, there is a clear need for improved security documentation in
ML, as one step towards addressing the existing gaps in ML-security. To achieve
this, we propose expanding existing documentation standards for
ML-documentation to include a security section with specific security relevant
information. Implementing this, a novel expanded method of documenting security
requirements in ML-documentation is presented, based on the existing Model
Cards and Datasheets for Datasets standards, but with the recommendation to
adopt these findings in all ML-documentation.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: IDFace is a secure and efficient HE-based face identification method that reduces computational overhead and protects user templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protecting user face templates in FRS is critical due to privacy risks, but existing HE-based methods are inefficient.

Method: IDFace uses template representation transformation and space-efficient encoding for efficient encrypted database searching.

Result: IDFace identifies a face from 1M encrypted templates in 126ms, with only 2X overhead vs. plaintext.

Conclusion: IDFace offers a practical balance between security and efficiency for FRS template protection.

Abstract: As face recognition systems (FRS) become more widely used, user privacy
becomes more important. A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's
face template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered
from the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as
homomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,
HE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In
particular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is
basically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined
shape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and
the system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based
face template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain
systems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based
secure and efficient face identification method with template protection.
IDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching
on a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The
first technique is a template representation transformation that sharply
reduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient
encoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving
the number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show
that IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted
templates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification
over plaintexts.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution and theoretical foundation for privacy protection in ad recommendation.

Abstract: To mitigate privacy leakage and performance issues in personalized

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Large language models violate the martingale property, challenging Bayesian inference foundations. Theoretical analysis shows positional encodings cause violations, transformers achieve optimality, and implicit posterior converges to true Bayesian. Empirical validation supports findings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the contradiction where transformers violate the martingale property, undermining Bayesian updating, and to provide theoretical and practical solutions for uncertainty quantification and computational efficiency.

Method: Theoretical analysis of positional encodings, transformers' optimality, and implicit posterior convergence, followed by empirical validation on GPT-3.

Result: Positional encodings cause martingale violations, transformers achieve optimal risk, implicit posterior converges, and optimal chain-of-thought length is derived. Empirical results confirm predictions.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical methods for calibrated uncertainty estimates and computational efficiency, validated by empirical results.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate remarkable in-context learning
capabilities, adapting to new tasks without parameter updates. While this
phenomenon has been successfully modeled as implicit Bayesian inference, recent
empirical findings reveal a fundamental contradiction: transformers
systematically violate the martingale property, a cornerstone requirement of
Bayesian updating on exchangeable data. This violation challenges the
theoretical foundations underlying uncertainty quantification in critical
applications.
  Our theoretical analysis establishes four key results: (1) positional
encodings induce martingale violations of order $\Theta(\log n / n)$; (2)
transformers achieve information-theoretic optimality with excess risk
$O(n^{-1/2})$ in expectation over orderings; (3) the implicit posterior
representation converges to the true Bayesian posterior in the space of
sufficient statistics; and (4) we derive the optimal chain-of-thought length as
$k^* = \Theta(\sqrt{n}\log(1/\varepsilon))$ with explicit constants, providing
a principled approach to reduce inference costs while maintaining performance.
Empirical validation on GPT-3 confirms predictions (1)-(3), with transformers
reaching 99\% of theoretical entropy limits within 20 examples. Our framework
provides practical methods for extracting calibrated uncertainty estimates from
position-aware architectures and optimizing computational efficiency in
deployment.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper examines bias in A/B tests for recommendation algorithms due to shared data interference, focusing on the importance of the sign of the global treatment effect (GTE) for decision-making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the bias (symbiosis bias) in GTE estimation caused by shared data interference in A/B tests, and to determine when the sign of the GTE is reliable for selecting better algorithms.

Method: Formalizes the problem under a multi-armed bandit framework, analyzing the alignment of the estimated and true GTE signs under data sharing.

Result: Identifies the balance between exploration and exploitation as critical for how symbiosis bias affects algorithm selection.

Conclusion: The sign of the GTE is often more important than its magnitude for decision-making, and the impact of symbiosis bias depends on the exploration-exploitation trade-off.

Abstract: We study A/B experiments that are designed to compare the performance of two
recommendation algorithms. Prior work has shown that the standard
difference-in-means estimator is biased in estimating the global treatment
effect (GTE) due to a particular form of interference between experimental
units. Specifically, units under the treatment and control algorithms
contribute to a shared pool of data that subsequently train both algorithms,
resulting in interference between the two groups. The bias arising from this
type of data sharing is known as "symbiosis bias". In this paper, we highlight
that, for decision-making purposes, the sign of the GTE often matters more than
its precise magnitude when selecting the better algorithm. We formalize this
insight under a multi-armed bandit framework and theoretically characterize
when the sign of the expected GTE estimate under data sharing aligns with or
contradicts the sign of the true GTE. Our analysis identifies the level of
exploration versus exploitation as a key determinant of how symbiosis bias
impacts algorithm selection.

TL;DR: The paper critiques influence functions for high-dimensional AI models, introduces Newfluence as a more accurate alternative, and extends the framework to other techniques like Shapley values.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for reliable tools to interpret and refine decisions of complex AI models, as traditional influence functions fail in high-dimensional settings.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of influence functions in high-dimensional regimes, followed by the introduction of Newfluence.

Result: Influence functions are unreliable in high-dimensional settings; Newfluence offers improved accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Newfluence is a better alternative for interpreting AI models, and the framework can analyze other techniques like Shapley values.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) models has created a pressing need for tools that help
scientists, engineers, and policymakers interpret and refine model decisions
and predictions. Influence functions, originating from robust statistics, have
emerged as a popular approach for this purpose.
  However, the heuristic foundations of influence functions rely on
low-dimensional assumptions where the number of parameters $p$ is much smaller
than the number of observations $n$. In contrast, modern AI models often
operate in high-dimensional regimes with large $p$, challenging these
assumptions.
  In this paper, we examine the accuracy of influence functions in
high-dimensional settings. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that
influence functions cannot reliably fulfill their intended purpose. We then
introduce an alternative approximation, called Newfluence, that maintains
similar computational efficiency while offering significantly improved
accuracy.
  Newfluence is expected to provide more accurate insights than many existing
methods for interpreting complex AI models and diagnosing their issues.
Moreover, the high-dimensional framework we develop in this paper can also be
applied to analyze other popular techniques, such as Shapley values.

### [255] [Incorporating Fairness Constraints into Archetypal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12021)
*Aleix Alcacer,Irene Epifanio*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA) and its nonlinear extension (FairKernelAA) are proposed to reduce bias in archetypal representations while maintaining interpretability and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Archetypal Analysis (AA) may encode sensitive attributes, raising fairness issues. This work aims to mitigate such biases without losing AA's benefits.

Method: FairAA introduces fairness regularization to reduce sensitive group influence. FairKernelAA extends this to nonlinear data. Both methods are evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: FairAA and FairKernelAA reduce group separability (measured by mean maximum discrepancy and linear separability) without significantly compromising explained variance.

Conclusion: FairAA balances utility and fairness, making it suitable for responsible representation learning in sensitive applications.

Abstract: Archetypal Analysis (AA) is an unsupervised learning method that represents
data as convex combinations of extreme patterns called archetypes. While AA
provides interpretable and low-dimensional representations, it can
inadvertently encode sensitive attributes, leading to fairness concerns. In
this work, we propose Fair Archetypal Analysis (FairAA), a modified formulation
that explicitly reduces the influence of sensitive group information in the
learned projections. We also introduce FairKernelAA, a nonlinear extension that
addresses fairness in more complex data distributions. Our approach
incorporates a fairness regularization term while preserving the structure and
interpretability of the archetypes. We evaluate FairAA and FairKernelAA on
synthetic datasets, including linear, nonlinear, and multi-group scenarios,
demonstrating their ability to reduce group separability -- as measured by mean
maximum discrepancy and linear separability -- without substantially
compromising explained variance. We further validate our methods on the
real-world ANSUR I dataset, confirming their robustness and practical utility.
The results show that FairAA achieves a favorable trade-off between utility and
fairness, making it a promising tool for responsible representation learning in
sensitive applications.

Abstract: We explore the use of Swin Transformer V2, a pre-trained vision Transformer,
for photometric classification in a multi-survey setting by leveraging light
curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Asteroid
Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We evaluate different strategies
for integrating data from these surveys and find that a multi-survey

*Suyuan Zhao,Yizhen Luo,Ganbo Yang,Yan Zhong,Hao Zhou,Zaiqing Nie*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: SToFM is a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model that extracts and integrates macro-, micro-, and gene-scale information from ST data, achieving strong performance on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data is complex and multi-scale, requiring integration of tissue morphology, cellular microenvironment, and gene expression. Existing models struggle with this challenge.

Method: SToFM extracts multi-scale information from ST slices, constructs sub-slices, and uses an SE(2) Transformer for cell representation. It is pretrained on SToCorpus-88M, the largest ST corpus.

Result: SToFM excels in tasks like tissue region segmentation and cell type annotation, showcasing its deep understanding of ST data.

Conclusion: SToFM effectively addresses the challenges of multi-scale ST data modeling, offering a robust foundation for advanced biological analysis.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich
insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells.
Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of
vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of
biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to
the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast
numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue
morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene
expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale
Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale
information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices
that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2)
Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the
sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest
high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves
outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region
semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive
understanding of ST data

### [258] [RNAMunin: A Deep Machine Learning Model for Non-coding RNA Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11950)
*Lauren Lui,Torben Nielsen*

Main category: q-bio.GN

TL;DR: RNAMunin is a small, fast ML model that identifies ncRNAs from genomic sequences alone, without needing transcriptomics data, and is scalable for large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current functional annotation of microbial genomes is biased toward protein-coding genes, leaving ncRNAs understudied despite their regulatory importance.

Method: RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences from 60 Gbp of long-read metagenomes and uses genomic sequence alone to detect ncRNAs.

Result: RNAMunin can identify ncRNAs at scale without requiring transcription data, making it unique and efficient.

Conclusion: RNAMunin addresses a critical gap in ncRNA detection, offering a scalable and efficient solution for genomic studies.

Abstract: Functional annotation of microbial genomes is often biased toward
protein-coding genes, leaving a vast, unexplored landscape of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) that are critical for regulating bacterial and archaeal physiology,
stress response and metabolism. Identifying ncRNAs directly from genomic
sequence is a paramount challenge in bioinformatics and biology, essential for
understanding the complete regulatory potential of an organism. This paper
presents RNAMunin, a machine learning (ML) model that is capable of finding
ncRNAs using genomic sequence alone. It is also computationally viable for
large sequence datasets such as long read metagenomic assemblies with contigs
totaling multiple Gbp. RNAMunin is trained on Rfam sequences extracted from
approximately 60 Gbp of long read metagenomes from 16 San Francisco Estuary
samples. We know of no other model that can detect ncRNAs based solely on
genomic sequence at this scale. Since RNAMunin only requires genomic sequence
as input, we do not need for an ncRNA to be transcribed to find it, i.e., we do
not need transcriptomics data. We wrote this manuscript in a narrative style in
order to best convey how RNAMunin was developed and how it works in detail.
Unlike almost all current ML models, at approximately 1M parameters, RNAMunin
is very small and very fast.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: EEG-based BCIs decode spontaneous 6D pose during passive video viewing, revealing distributed neural encoding of spatial cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand large-scale neural dynamics of spatial representation during passive, naturalistic experiences.

Method: Non-invasive EEG-based BCIs decode 6D pose (position and orientation) during passive viewing of egocentric video.

Result: Spatially coherent visual input evokes decodable spatial representations, with improved performance at 100 ms frame rates. Distinct EEG channels contribute to position and orientation encoding.

Conclusion: Spatial cognition operates spontaneously under passive conditions, blurring traditional distinctions between active and passive cognition.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable capacity for spatial cognition, allowing for
self-localization even in novel or unfamiliar environments. While hippocampal
neurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale
neural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during
naturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we
demonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,
fine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and
orientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited
spatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent
visual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable
spatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of
spatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is
presented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with
intrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation
through a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing
to position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed
yet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the
brain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under
passive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and
passive spatial cognition. Our results offer a non-invasive window into the
automatic construction of egocentric spatial maps and advance our understanding
of how the human mind transforms everyday sensory experience into structured
internal representations.

TL;DR: A two-phase framework combines neural networks, feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression to discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites, improving accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for accurate and interpretable descriptors for oxide perovskite catalysts' OER activity drives the development of a method that overcomes limitations of symbolic regression with high-dimensional inputs and small datasets.

Method: A two-phase approach: Phase I uses a small dataset and symbolic regression to refine known descriptors; Phase II expands features, reduces dimensionality, and identifies key electronic descriptors like LUMO energy.

Result: Improved accuracy (training MAE 22.1 meV, validation MAE 20.6 meV) with interpretable descriptors (μ/t, μ/RA, LUMO energy), showing NN-guided SR balances interpretability and accuracy.

Conclusion: NN-guided symbolic regression effectively discovers accurate and interpretable descriptors in data-scarce scenarios, proving interpretability doesn't compromise accuracy in materials informatics.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate
and physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to
discover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs
and small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural
networks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to
discover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In
Phase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and
improve the known {\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and
applying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8
and 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce
dimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A
final formula using {\mu}/t, {\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved
accuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong
physical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic
regression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful
descriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need
not sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.

*Changjian Chen,Pengcheng Wang,Fei Lyu,Zhuo Tang,Li Yang,Long Wang,Yong Cai,Feng Yu,Kenli Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A visual analysis method is proposed to improve hybrid rice breeding by combining genomic selection with interactive tools for regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current genomic prediction models lack accuracy, requiring breeders to rely on experience, making the process time-consuming.

Method: Developed a parametric dual projection method for interactive dual analysis, along with gene and hybrid visualizations.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness through quantitative evaluation, case studies, and positive breeder feedback.

Conclusion: The method enhances hybrid rice breeding by integrating visual analysis with genomic selection, improving efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the
resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits,
such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient
way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their
genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the
workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic
prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the
models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,
which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we
proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice
breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally
ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual
projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual
analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene
visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory
genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the
quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified
regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback
from breeders.

TL;DR: AFPM framework improves cross-dataset EEG decoding by aligning channels and encoding spatiotemporal patches, outperforming 17 methods by up to 4.40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in EEG decoding like channel layout inconsistencies and limited neurophysiological prior integration.

Method: Uses Spatial Alignment for channel selection and distribution alignment, and Frame-Patch Encoding for unified signal modeling.

Result: Achieves up to 4.40% and 3.58% performance gains on motor imagery and event-related potential tasks.

Conclusion: AFPM is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding framework, enhancing BCI practicality.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel
layout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited
neurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a
plug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has
two main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels
based on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and
remaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding,
which models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG
decoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific
tuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to
4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our
knowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding
framework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Generative AI models reproduce cultural biases, associating ugliness with old white males, despite efforts to avoid stereotypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine how generative AI models understand and express ugliness and the biases embedded in these representations.

Method: Used four AI models to generate 624 images based on 13 adjectives for ugliness, then coded and analyzed demographic attributes.

Result: AI disproportionately links ugliness to old white males, reflecting entrenched and paradoxical biases.

Conclusion: Generative AI perpetuates biases, highlighting the need for ethical training and inclusive development.

Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces
deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how
concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study
investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express
ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these
representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through
iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across
four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes
within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our
findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old
white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical
biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups
inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes
onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite
supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional
physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs.
These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal
representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and
paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical
AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI
development.

TL;DR: The paper introduces d-DQIVAR, a visual analytics system combining data- and process-driven approaches to improve data quality (DQ) for better ML model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on batch data preprocessing, often distorting data and lacking genuine DQ improvement (DQI).

Method: d-DQIVAR integrates visual analytics with data-driven (e.g., imputation, outlier detection) and process-driven (e.g., DQ evaluation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) techniques.

Result: The system enables effective DQI strategies, leveraging expert knowledge through case studies and user evaluations.

Conclusion: d-DQIVAR successfully bridges the gap between data preprocessing and genuine DQI, enhancing ML performance.

Abstract: Approaches to enhancing data quality (DQ) are classified into two main
categories: data- and process-driven. However, prior research has predominantly
utilized batch data preprocessing within the data-driven framework, which often
proves insufficient for optimizing machine learning (ML) model performance and
frequently leads to distortions in data characteristics. Existing studies have
primarily focused on data preprocessing rather than genuine data quality
improvement (DQI). In this paper, we introduce d-DQIVAR, a novel visual
analytics system designed to facilitate DQI strategies aimed at improving ML
model performance. Our system integrates visual analytics techniques that
leverage both data-driven and process-driven approaches. Data-driven techniques
tackle DQ issues such as imputation, outlier detection, deletion, format
standardization, removal of duplicate records, and feature selection.
Process-driven strategies encompass evaluating DQ and DQI procedures by
considering DQ dimensions and ML model performance and applying the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We illustrate how our system empowers users to harness
expert and domain knowledge effectively within a practical workflow through
case studies, evaluations, and user studies.

TL;DR: A dataset-adaptive approach using structural complexity metrics optimizes dimensionality reduction (DR) by predicting the maximum achievable accuracy, reducing trial and error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DR optimization involves extensive trial and error, leading to computational inefficiency.

Method: Proposes structural complexity metrics to quantify dataset complexity and guide DR optimization.

Result: Metrics effectively approximate dataset complexity and improve DR workflow efficiency without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: The dataset-adaptive workflow enhances DR optimization efficiency by leveraging structural complexity metrics.

Abstract: Selecting the appropriate dimensionality reduction (DR) technique and
determining its optimal hyperparameter settings that maximize the accuracy of
the output projections typically involves extensive trial and error, often
resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address this challenge, we
propose a dataset-adaptive approach to DR optimization guided by structural
complexity metrics. These metrics quantify the intrinsic complexity of a
dataset, predicting whether higher-dimensional spaces are necessary to
represent it accurately. Since complex datasets are often inaccurately
represented in two-dimensional projections, leveraging these metrics enables us
to predict the maximum achievable accuracy of DR techniques for a given
dataset, eliminating redundant trials in optimizing DR. We introduce the design
and theoretical foundations of these structural complexity metrics. We
quantitatively verify that our metrics effectively approximate the ground truth
complexity of datasets and confirm their suitability for guiding
dataset-adaptive DR workflow. Finally, we empirically show that our
dataset-adaptive workflow significantly enhances the efficiency of DR
optimization without compromising accuracy.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: The paper benchmarks Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models for long-context inference on consumer GPUs, showing SSMs outperform Transformers in scalability and speed for very long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient machine intelligence on local devices drives research into alternatives to quadratic-complexity Transformers, like SSMs, but practical hardware performance data is lacking.

Method: A comparative benchmarking of Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models on consumer and embedded GPUs, focusing on long-context inference, with operator-level analysis.

Result: SSMs handle sequences up to 220K tokens (4x longer than Transformers) and are up to 4x faster for very long contexts (~57K tokens). Custom SSM kernels dominate runtime.

Conclusion: SSMs are superior for long-context tasks on consumer hardware, with custom kernels as key optimization targets. The framework will be open-sourced to aid future research.

Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous,
long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic
complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures
make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a
paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and
hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses
on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic
performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically
needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of
carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for
long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that
SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing
sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than
comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short
sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x
faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals
that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime,
accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a
primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed,
device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the
edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization
framework.

TL;DR: The paper compares monomodal and multimodal methods for detecting coordinated online behavior, emphasizing the benefits of multimodal approaches for a comprehensive understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of traditional monomodal methods in capturing complex multimodal coordination dynamics in online behavior.

Method: Comparison of weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, assessing trade-offs between broad coordination patterns and tightly coordinated behavior.

Result: Multimodal approaches provide a more comprehensive understanding, though not all modalities offer distinct insights.

Conclusion: Multimodal detection enhances analysis of coordinated behavior, aiding digital platform integrity.

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions
to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key
focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on
monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets
or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other.
However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in
multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing
the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off
between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the
balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly
coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we
assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how
varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our
findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that
with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of
coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze
coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the
integrity of digital platforms.

the challenges and opportunities these AI tools present. While Generative AI
improves efficiency and supports creative student work, it raises concerns such
as AI hallucinations, error propagation, bias, and blurred lines between
AI-assisted and student-authored content. Human oversight is crucial for
addressing these concerns. Existing literature recommends adopting hybrid
assessment models that combine AI with human evaluation, developing bias
detection frameworks, and promoting AI literacy for both students and

TL;DR: The study audits AI resume screening tools, revealing biases and incompetence, introducing the 'Illusion of Neutrality' and recommending dual-validation for fairness and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether AI systems used for resume screening are competent and unbiased, given their increasing adoption as alternatives to human decision-making.

Method: A two-part audit of eight AI platforms: Experiment 1 tested for racial and gender biases, while Experiment 2 evaluated core competence.

Result: Found biases in some models and incompetence in others, where apparent neutrality masked superficial evaluations. Introduced the 'Illusion of Neutrality.'

Conclusion: Recommends a dual-validation framework to audit AI tools for both bias and competence to ensure equitable and effective hiring practices.

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the
assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human
decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are
these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant
to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a
two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex,
contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates
merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated
core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared
unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation,
relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the
"Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of
bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments.
This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation
framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable
competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

Method: Leverages the TBJ framework to assess AI's role in research, focusing on analytic, generative, and agentic AI, and emphasizes human-machine collaboration.

Result: AI can augment data scientists but poses risks like push-button automation, requiring human oversight to ensure quality and ethical use.

Conclusion: Advocates for advancing AI tools while emphasizing training and human collaboration to maximize research value and ethical application.

Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys,
synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While
the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not
always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice
(TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models
for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024),
we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic
AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human
analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their
tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier
eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using
statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully
understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize
a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018)
throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role
that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging
the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for
continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value
of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon

### [272] [The Safety Gap Toolkit: Evaluating Hidden Dangers of Open-Source Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11544)
*Ann-Kathrin Dombrowski,Dillon Bowen,Adam Gleave,Chris Cundy*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a toolkit to measure the 'safety gap' in open-weight LLMs, showing that removing safeguards increases dangerous capabilities, especially in larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks posed by modifiable open-weight LLMs, where bad actors can bypass safeguards, leading to harmful uses.

Method: The authors evaluate models (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) of varying sizes (0.5B to 405B) using different safeguard removal techniques, assessing biochemical/cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality.

Result: The safety gap widens with model scale, and dangerous capabilities increase significantly when safeguards are removed.

Conclusion: The Safety Gap Toolkit aims to evaluate open-source models and encourage tamper-resistant safeguards, with community contributions welcomed.

Abstract: Open-weight large language models (LLMs) unlock huge benefits in innovation,
personalization, privacy, and democratization. However, their core advantage -
modifiability - opens the door to systemic risks: bad actors can trivially
subvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This
leads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a
model with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those
safeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for
state-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical
and cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from
two families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to
405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that
the safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous
capabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the
Safety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve
as an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation
for developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome
contributions to the toolkit from the community.

### [273] [JSQA: Speech Quality Assessment with Perceptually-Inspired Contrastive Pretraining Based on JND Audio Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11636)
*Junyi Fan,Donald Williamson*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: JSQA is a two-stage framework for speech quality assessment (SQA) that uses perceptually-guided contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction, improving model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MOS exhibits high variance due to perceptual and experimental differences, and many existing SQA methods fail to incorporate perceptual factors beyond MOS labels, leading to unsatisfactory results.

Method: JSQA pretrains an audio encoder using JND pairs (clean LibriSpeech mixed with CHiME-3 noise at varying SNRs) via contrastive learning, then fine-tunes it on the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction.

Result: Perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly improves model performance compared to training from scratch, as shown by various metrics.

Conclusion: Incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining enhances SQA performance, demonstrating the value of JSQA's two-stage approach.

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a
high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score
(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging
for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent
variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions
have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual
factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead
to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework
that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning
on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS
prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are
then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity
information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean
LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at
different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with
audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results
suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly
improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared
against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These
findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly
contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: Hebbian learning enables automatic heterogeneity in swarm robotics, resolving challenges like the micro-macro problem and dimensionality, while improving swarm capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning heterogeneous control in swarm robotics, such as the micro-macro problem and scalability issues.

Method: Uses Hebbian learning, a biologically inspired neural adaptation method relying on local information, with uniform rules across swarm members.

Result: Heterogeneity naturally emerges, enabling swarm-level behavioral switching and improved capabilities, comparable to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning.

Conclusion: Hebbian learning is a viable alternative for optimizing heterogeneous swarms, reducing the need for extensive prior knowledge.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm
robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning
presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies
on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for
learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of
attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules,
thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules
across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the
curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian
learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive
prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This
work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges,
resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved
swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning
rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in
standard benchmarking tasks.

TL;DR: A neuromorphic system based on six neuroscience principles learns language semantics, syntax, and word order from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between neural spiking and high-level cognition like language by formalizing basic neuroscience principles.

Method: Implemented a simulated neuromorphic system using excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses, Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition.

Result: The system learned word semantics, syntax, and word order from minimal grounded sentences, even generating novel sentences.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for understanding cognition and could be extended further.

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in neuroscience, we do not have a compelling
narrative for the precise way whereby the spiking of neurons in our brain
results in high-level cognitive phenomena such as planning and language. We
introduce a simple mathematical formulation of six basic and broadly accepted
principles of neuroscience: excitatory neurons, brain areas, random synapses,
Hebbian plasticity, local inhibition, and inter-area inhibition. We implement a
simulated neuromorphic system based on this formalism, which is capable of
basic language acquisition: Starting from a tabula rasa, the system learns, in
any language, the semantics of words, their syntactic role (verb versus noun),
and the word order of the language, including the ability to generate novel
sentences, through the exposure to a modest number of grounded sentences in the
same language. We discuss several possible extensions and implications of this
result.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: The paper reviews 10 early EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), highlighting their reliance on transformer-based backbones and masked sequence reconstruction for self-supervision. It identifies gaps in evaluation and calls for standardized benchmarks and collaboration for real-world utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The transition to self-supervised EEG encoders (EEG-FMs) addresses the limitations of supervised methods, but their real-world readiness and research progress remain unclear. A systematic review is needed to guide future development.

Method: The study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs, analyzing their methodology (e.g., transformer-based backbones, masked sequence reconstruction) and empirical findings.

Result: Most EEG-FMs use transformer-based models and self-supervision, but evaluations are heterogeneous and limited, hindering practical assessment.

Conclusion: Future EEG-FMs need standardized evaluations, scaling effects, and principled choices. Collaboration with domain experts is key for translational utility.

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography
(EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The
inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their
over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards
general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models
(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the
real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research
progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of
first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current
state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,
this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their
methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that
most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on
transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for
self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely
limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.
In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work
should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and
trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We
believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies,
and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the
translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a 3D latent motion representation (DoRF) from Wi-Fi CSI Doppler projections, improving HAR generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Wi-Fi CSI-based HAR lacks generalizability for practical use.

Method: Inspired by NeRF, the approach reconstructs a 3D latent motion representation from 1D Doppler projections, creating a uniform Doppler radiance field (DoRF).

Result: The method significantly boosts HAR generalization accuracy.

Conclusion: DoRFs show strong potential for practical Wi-Fi-based sensing.

Abstract: Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has gained increasing interest for
remote sensing applications. Recent studies show that Doppler velocity
projections extracted from CSI can enable human activity recognition (HAR) that
is robust to environmental changes and generalizes to new users. However,
despite these advances, generalizability still remains insufficient for
practical deployment. Inspired by neural radiance fields (NeRF), which learn a
volumetric representation of a 3D scene from 2D images, this work proposes a
novel approach to reconstruct an informative 3D latent motion representation
from one-dimensional Doppler velocity projections extracted from Wi-Fi CSI. The
resulting latent representation is then used to construct a uniform Doppler
radiance field (DoRF) of the motion, providing a comprehensive view of the
performed activity and improving the robustness to environmental variability.
The results show that the proposed approach noticeably enhances the
generalization accuracy of Wi-Fi-based HAR, highlighting the strong potential
of DoRFs for practical sensing applications.

*Rachna Saxena,Abhijeet Kumar,Suresh Shanmugam*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes a scalable and efficient vision retrieval process for multimodal Q&A using hybrid search and late interaction re-ranking, addressing challenges in current systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional and multimodal LLMs struggle with infographics and scalability in retrieval tasks, hindering enterprise adoption.

Method: A multi-step custom approach combines hybrid search (metadata & embedding) with late interaction re-ranking to retrieve and contextualize best matching pages for MLLM-generated answers.

Result: The design achieves scalability (speed improvements) and stability (maintained performance), suitable for enterprise production.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses scalability and efficiency in vision-augmented Q&A without compromising quality.

Abstract: Traditional information extraction systems face challenges with text only
language models as it does not consider infographics (visual elements of
information) such as tables, charts, images etc. often used to convey complex
information to readers. Multimodal LLM (MLLM) face challenges of finding needle
in the haystack problem i.e., either longer context length or substantial
number of documents as search space. Late interaction mechanism over visual
language models has shown state of the art performance in retrieval-based
vision augmented Q&A tasks. There are yet few challenges using it for RAG based
multi-modal Q&A. Firstly, many popular and widely adopted vector databases do
not support native multi-vector retrieval. Secondly, late interaction requires
computation which inflates space footprint and can hinder enterprise adoption.
Lastly, the current state of late interaction mechanism does not leverage the
approximate neighbor search indexing methods for large speed ups in retrieval
process. This paper explores a pragmatic approach to make vision retrieval
process scalable and efficient without compromising on performance quality. We
propose multi-step custom implementation utilizing widely adopted hybrid search
(metadata & embedding) and state of the art late interaction re-ranker to
retrieve best matching pages. Finally, MLLM are prompted as reader to generate
answers from contextualized best matching pages. Through experiments, we
observe that the proposed design is scalable (significant speed up) and stable
(without degrading performance quality), hence can be used as production
systems at enterprises.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper explores using sparse autoencoders (SAE) to interpret and control transformer-based sequential recommendation models, showing improved interpretability and user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding and controlling black-box transformer models in sequential recommendations is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: Apply sparse autoencoders (SAE) to extract interpretable features from transformer hidden states in sequential recommendation tasks.

Result: SAE-derived features are more interpretable and monosemantic, enabling flexible control over model behavior for customized recommendations.

Conclusion: SAE is a promising tool for enhancing interpretability and user control in transformer-based sequential recommendation systems.

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based
on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box
models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their
internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is
very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse
autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for
extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders
learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from
sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential
recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied
to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned
directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original
hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by
SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior,
providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their
recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

TL;DR: The paper discusses fairness in recommender systems, focusing on avoiding filter bubbles by balancing personalized recommendations with diversity metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness concerns in recommender systems from user, content creator, and societal perspectives, particularly the issue of filter bubbles.

Method: Define performance metrics for diversity and integrate them into the recommender system's evaluation framework to tweak its performance.

Result: Aims to achieve a balance between personalized recommendations and societal diversity goals.

Conclusion: Recommender systems can be fine-tuned to avoid filter bubbles by incorporating diversity metrics, fostering inclusivity and varied perspectives.

Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday
experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries
online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of
building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social
media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several
perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the
content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating
the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern
across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes
place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so
tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of
opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's
perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's
perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of
potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are
far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political
decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation
of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape?
Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to
represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through
the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation
framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and
the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of
view.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counting answer sets is crucial for applications like probabilistic reasoning and network reliability, but existing methods struggle with disjunctive programs.

Method: SharpASP-SR uses subtractive reduction to transform the problem into projected propositional model counting, ensuring polynomial-sized intermediate representations.

Result: Experimental results show SharpASP-SR outperforms existing counters, especially for programs with large answer sets.

Conclusion: A hybrid approach combining enumeration with SharpASP-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance for disjunctive programs.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for
knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has
emerged as an important computational problem with applications in
probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This
has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While
substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development
of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of
disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected
propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative
characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring
that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows
SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology.
Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate
that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with
large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid
counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to
achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive
programs.

TL;DR: A spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) improves magnetic field imaging (MFI) for non-destructive testing in advanced semiconductor packaging by addressing eddy current effects and image misalignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity of advanced packaging layers makes non-destructive testing challenging, requiring better methods to convert magnetic fields into current density accurately.

Method: SPIM includes magnetic image enhancement, alignment correction, and an inversion method combining the Biot-Savart Law with FFT.

Result: SPIM improved I-channel sharpness by 0.3%, reduced Q-channel sharpness by 25%, and corrected misalignments of 0.30 in real images.

Conclusion: SPIM demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating spatial analysis with physics-driven models for practical MFI applications.

Abstract: The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced
packaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of
the layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables
the imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective
in NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This
conversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for
magnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy
current effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we
present a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample
scanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.
The SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by
aligning all the "sharp" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect
using both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)
magnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment
of the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an
inversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by
integrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM
improves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.
Also, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a
real image. Overall, SPIM highlights the potential of combining spatial
analysis with physics-driven models in practical applications.

Main category: cs.SC

TL;DR: A lightweight runtime monitoring framework is proposed for real-time verification of neural certificates in cyber-physical systems, ensuring safety without exhaustive state-space exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional formal verification of neural certificates (e.g., barrier functions) faces scalability issues due to exhaustive state-space exploration.

Method: The framework integrates real-time verification via runtime monitoring, observing the system during deployment and verifying certificates over a lookahead region.

Result: Demonstrated practical effectiveness in a case study, enabling timely detection of safety violations with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The framework provides a lightweight, effective alternative to static verification for ensuring system safety.

Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems
control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as
barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified,
serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal
verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability
challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this
challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that
integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying
control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs
on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure
safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for
ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical
effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety
violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an
effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the
certificates.

TL;DR: FactorHD is a novel HDC model for efficiently representing and factorizing complex class-subclass relations in neuro-symbolic AI, outperforming existing models in speed and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HDC models struggle with representing and factorizing complex class-subclass relations, limiting their effectiveness in neuro-symbolic AI.

Method: FactorHD introduces symbolic encoding with an extra memorization clause and an efficient factorization algorithm to eliminate redundant classes.

Result: FactorHD achieves a 5667x speedup at large representation sizes and 92.48% factorization accuracy when integrated with ResNet-18 on Cifar-10.

Conclusion: FactorHD overcomes key limitations of existing HDC models, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in neuro-symbolic AI tasks.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical
analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising
brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various
HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class
relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation,
where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses,
they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI
systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of
representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently.
FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization
clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it
employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates
redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class.
Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in
representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation,
overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition
catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves
approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to
existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network,
FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes a model-aware AIGC task offloading framework for IIoT edge computing, using MADDPG-MATO to reduce latency and energy consumption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of computation-intensive AIGC tasks and low-latency demands in IIoT environments, where traditional cloud-based models fail.

Method: Introduces a multi-agent collaborative offloading framework with MADDPG-MATO algorithm to optimize task distribution among edge servers.

Result: Achieves 6.98% lower latency, 7.12% less energy use, and 3.72% higher task completion rate compared to baselines.

Conclusion: MADDPG-MATO is robust and efficient for dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial
Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart
manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to
computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative
models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time
requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can
effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature
of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher
demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing
environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC
model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent
collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge
servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task
offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
(MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental
results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an
average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72%
increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model
numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is
robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: PGT-I introduces distributed training for ST-GNNs with index-batching and distributed-index-batching, reducing memory usage by 89% and achieving 13.1x speedup on 128 GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current frameworks lack support for distributed training of ST-GNNs and ignore spatiotemporal data properties, limiting scalability.

Method: PGT-I extends PyTorch Geometric Temporal with index-batching and distributed-index-batching to dynamically construct snapshots and enable multi-GPU processing.

Result: Enabled training on the full PeMS dataset without partitioning, reducing memory usage by 89% and speeding up training 13.1x with 128 GPUs.

Conclusion: PGT-I effectively addresses memory constraints in ST-GNN training, enabling large-scale applications.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for
modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications
have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory
constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks
lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of
spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we
present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch
Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two
novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index
techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically
at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while
distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable
processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training
of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing
peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over
standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

*Shuyang Xu,Zhiyang Dou,Mingyi Shi,Liang Pan,Leo Ho,Jingbo Wang,Yuan Liu,Cheng Lin,Yuexin Ma,Wenping Wang,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (SAM) and a diffusion-based model (MOSPA) for generating human motion from spatial audio, addressing a gap in existing research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virtual humans lack realistic responses to auditory stimuli, especially spatial audio, which is underexplored in current motion synthesis models.

Method: The authors create the SAM dataset and develop MOSPA, a diffusion-based framework, to model human motion from spatial audio using an effective fusion mechanism.

Result: MOSPA achieves state-of-the-art performance, generating diverse and realistic human motions from spatial audio inputs.

Conclusion: The work bridges a research gap by integrating spatial audio and motion synthesis, with open-sourced resources for future work.

Abstract: Enabling virtual humans to dynamically and realistically respond to diverse
auditory stimuli remains a key challenge in character animation, demanding the
integration of perceptual modeling and motion synthesis. Despite its
significance, this task remains largely unexplored. Most previous works have
primarily focused on mapping modalities like speech, audio, and music to
generate human motion. As of yet, these models typically overlook the impact of
spatial features encoded in spatial audio signals on human motion. To bridge
this gap and enable high-quality modeling of human movements in response to
spatial audio, we introduce the first comprehensive Spatial Audio-Driven Human
Motion (SAM) dataset, which contains diverse and high-quality spatial audio and
motion data. For benchmarking, we develop a simple yet effective
diffusion-based generative framework for human MOtion generation driven by
SPatial Audio, termed MOSPA, which faithfully captures the relationship between
body motion and spatial audio through an effective fusion mechanism. Once
trained, MOSPA could generate diverse realistic human motions conditioned on
varying spatial audio inputs. We perform a thorough investigation of the
proposed dataset and conduct extensive experiments for benchmarking, where our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. Our model and
dataset will be open-sourced upon acceptance. Please refer to our supplementary
video for more details.

*Tielong Wang,Yuxuan Xiong,Jinfan Liu,Zhifan Zhang,Ye Chen,Yue Shi,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel 3D Hierarchical Proxy Node representation is introduced to address limitations of current 3D representations, offering universal applicability, compactness, and superior editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D representations (meshes, voxels, point clouds, NeRFs) are task-specific, lack universal applicability, and struggle with trade-offs between complexity and fidelity.

Method: The method uses a sparse set of hierarchically organized proxy nodes with local shape/texture information encoded by small MLPs, enabling efficient neural interpolation and decoding.

Result: The framework achieves compact representation, high-fidelity rendering, and superior editability, demonstrated in 3D reconstruction and editing tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed Hierarchical Proxy Node representation overcomes limitations of existing methods, providing expressive efficiency and scalable quality-complexity control.

Abstract: Current 3D representations like meshes, voxels, point clouds, and NeRF-based
neural implicit fields exhibit significant limitations: they are often
task-specific, lacking universal applicability across reconstruction,
generation, editing, and driving. While meshes offer high precision, their
dense vertex data complicates editing; NeRFs deliver excellent rendering but
suffer from structural ambiguity, hindering animation and manipulation; all
representations inherently struggle with the trade-off between data complexity
and fidelity. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical
Proxy Node representation. Its core innovation lies in representing an object's
shape and texture via a sparse set of hierarchically organized
(tree-structured) proxy nodes distributed on its surface and interior. Each
node stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small
MLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves
efficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby
and parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where
nodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,
and offers scalable quality-complexity control. Extensive experiments across 3D
reconstruction and editing demonstrate our method's expressive efficiency,
high-fidelity rendering quality, and superior editability.

*Ziv Aharoni,Henry D. Pfister*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels, reducing computational complexity from $O(N^4)$ to $O(AN\log N)$ and enabling applications for longer block lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polar decoders for deletion channels have high computational complexity ($O(N^4)$), limiting their use to short-to-moderate block lengths. The goal is to reduce this complexity.

Method: The NPD architecture is extended for deletion channels using four neural networks, modifying one to handle deletions. The complexity is controlled by a user-defined parameter $A$.

Result: The NPD achieves reduced complexity ($O(AN\log N)$) and is validated for deletion rates $\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$. List decoding further improves performance.

Conclusion: The extended NPD offers a scalable solution for deletion channels, with potential applications in technologies like DNA storage.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with
a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit
high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This
limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to
short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing
NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we
extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,
the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating
fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support
deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational
complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a
computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.
We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates
$\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by
the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced
complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further
improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have
applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

*Justin Whitehouse,Morgane Austern,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: econ.EM

TL;DR: The paper introduces a softmax smoothing-based estimator for constructing confidence intervals for optimal treatment policy values, addressing non-differentiability issues without unrealistic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a reliable method for estimating optimal treatment policy values in causal inference, overcoming limitations of existing approaches like unrealistic parametric assumptions or computational intractability.

Method: Uses softmax smoothing to approximate non-differentiable functionals, carefully controlling bias and remainders to ensure accurate estimation.

Result: The estimator achieves √n convergence rates, avoids unrealistic assumptions, and is often statistically efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a practical and efficient solution for estimating optimal treatment policy values, bridging gaps in existing approaches.

Abstract: Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment
policy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal
policy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized
treatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal
value is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing
inference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this
non-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators
based on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These
approaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic
parametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches
that directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place
parametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the
computation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic
$L^\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that
prohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of
constructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals. By
carefully controlling first-order bias and second-order remainders, we show
that a softmax smoothing-based estimator can be used to estimate parameters
that are specified as a maximum of scores involving nuisance components. In
particular, this includes the value of the optimal treatment policy as a
special case. Our estimator obtains $\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates, avoids
parametric restrictions/unrealistic margin assumptions, and is often
statistically efficient.

*Timothy Heightman,Edward Jiang,Ruth Mora-Soto,Maciej Lewenstein,Marcin Płodzień*

TL;DR: The paper proposes a phase-space formalism for quantum machine learning (QML) to address the limitations of classical simulations by leveraging quasi-probability functions and symplectic manifolds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QML faces practical limits due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space in classical simulations. Phase-space methods offer an alternative to overcome this challenge.

Method: The authors construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for qubit systems using the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence, replacing operator algebra with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds.

Result: The formalism recasts the curse of dimensionality as harmonic support on a linearly scaling domain, enabling variational modelling in phase-space.

Conclusion: This approach provides a new route for QML by addressing scalability issues through phase-space methods.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of
quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum
entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential
growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical
simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the
other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states
as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and
the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable
dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This
formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function
dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in
terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of
qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over
phase-space.

TL;DR: BenchRL-QAS is a benchmarking framework for evaluating RL algorithms in quantum architecture search (QAS), showing no single RL method is universally optimal and performance depends on task context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate RL algorithms in QAS across diverse quantum tasks and system sizes, ensuring fair and comprehensive comparisons.

Method: Benchmarks nine RL agents on quantum tasks like variational eigensolver and state preparation, using a weighted ranking metric for accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and efficiency.

Result: RL-based quantum classifiers outperform baselines, but no single RL algorithm is universally optimal; performance varies with task, qubit count, and noise.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for tailored algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking in quantum circuit design, supporting the 'no free lunch' principle in RL-QAS.

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically
evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture
search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system
sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including
both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems
such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state
diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both
noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric
that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational
efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first
reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational
classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally
optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly
context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This
empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in
RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored
algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit
synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking
effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made

*Monica Lăcătuş,Matthias Möller*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: The paper introduces a surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) to approximate the BGK collision operator in quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM), addressing challenges in nonlinear collision steps for quantum CFD simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CFD struggles with high Reynolds number turbulent flows, prompting interest in quantum algorithms for potential speed-ups. QLBM's collision step implementation remains a challenge.

Method: A four-qubit SQC is trained to mimic the BGK collision operator, ensuring physical properties like mass/momentum conservation and equivariance. It avoids ancilla qubits and post-selection.

Result: The SQC requires only 2,430 gates, operates without ancilla qubits or repeated executions, and maintains depth independence from grid resolution. It accurately simulates benchmark flows.

Conclusion: The SQC framework successfully addresses the collision step challenge in QLBM, enabling efficient quantum CFD simulations with validated accuracy.

Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers
remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing
interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum
computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver
potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is
a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM.
Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step,
implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth
circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and
repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address
this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum
circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision
operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the
physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum
conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate
set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit
connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses
neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its
depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation
that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on
two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity,
demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow
recirculation.

TL;DR: A generative AI method simplifies galaxy images into skeletonized forms for accurate shape analysis without predefined classes, tested on 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High volumes of galaxy images require automation for accurate analysis beyond predefined classes.

Method: Generative AI simplifies galaxy images into skeletonized forms for shape measurement.

Result: Applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images; catalog of simplified images is publicly available.

Conclusion: The method enables flexible and accurate galaxy shape analysis without class limitations.

Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of
galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the
shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images
requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning
annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we
introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative
AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them
into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements
of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined
set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images
acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available.
The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods address music performance tasks separately, lacking integration. RUMAA aims to unify these tasks efficiently.

Method: Uses pre-trained score and audio encoders with a tri-stream decoder to capture task interdependencies. Aligns MusicXML scores with performance audio, avoiding traditional MIDI limitations.

Result: Matches state-of-the-art alignment on non-repeated scores and outperforms on repeated scores. Also shows promise in transcription and mistake detection.

Conclusion: RUMAA successfully integrates multiple music performance tasks, offering improved alignment and additional functionalities.

Abstract: This study introduces RUMAA, a transformer-based framework for music
performance analysis that unifies score-to-performance alignment,
score-informed transcription, and mistake detection in a near end-to-end
manner. Unlike prior methods addressing these tasks separately, RUMAA
integrates them using pre-trained score and audio encoders and a novel
tri-stream decoder capturing task interdependencies through proxy tasks. It
aligns human-readable MusicXML scores with repeat symbols to full-length
performance audio, overcoming traditional MIDI-based methods that rely on
manually unfolded score-MIDI data with pre-specified repeat structures. RUMAA
matches state-of-the-art alignment methods on non-repeated scores and
outperforms them on scores with repeats in a public piano music dataset, while

TL;DR: QTTS is a novel TTS framework using QDAC, a multi-codebook audio codec, for high-fidelity speech and audio synthesis. It outperforms single-codebook methods by preserving fine-grained details and accelerating inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS methods with single-codebook representations lose fine-grained details, especially in complex scenarios like singing voice synthesis.

Method: QTTS uses QDAC, an end-to-end trained ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, and introduces Hierarchical Parallel architecture and Delay Multihead for better synthesis and faster inference.

Result: QTTS achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive content compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Multi-codebook modeling is promising for high-fidelity, general-purpose speech and audio generation.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete
modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on
single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information
loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these
methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances,
speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing
voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our
new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end
training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves
superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless
compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies:
the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model
inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay
Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to
accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive
content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via
multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity,
general-purpose speech and audio generation.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Task 3 of the DCASE2025 Challenge, focusing on stereo sound event localization and detection (SELD) with new metrics and a dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift focus from specialized 360° audio to more common stereo scenarios with limited field-of-view, addressing angular ambiguities in stereo data.

Method: Uses stereo audio and video data, introducing a baseline system for event classification, localization, and onscreen/offscreen classification.

Result: The baseline system performs reasonably well with stereo audio data.

Conclusion: The challenge advances SELD research by adapting to stereo audio and limited FOV scenarios, with new evaluation metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents the objective, dataset, baseline, and metrics of Task 3
of the DCASE2025 Challenge on sound event localization and detection (SELD). In
previous editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order
Ambisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge
investigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change
shifts the focus from more specialized 360{\deg} audio and audiovisual scene
analysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited
field-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,
the task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane
(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided
into two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track
introducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification
necessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3
Stereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled
and converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to
process stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to
the typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates
onscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation
metrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric,
which assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are
onscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs
reasonably well with the stereo audio data.

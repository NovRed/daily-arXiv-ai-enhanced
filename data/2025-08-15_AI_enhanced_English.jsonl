We term this principle 'Dynamical Alignment'.\n  Applying this principle offers a novel resolution to the long-standing\nparadox of why brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) underperform. By\nencoding static input into controllable dynamical trajectories, we uncover a\nbimodal optimization landscape with a critical phase transition governed by\nphase space volume dynamics. A 'dissipative' mode, driven by contracting\ndynamics, achieves superior energy efficiency through sparse temporal codes.

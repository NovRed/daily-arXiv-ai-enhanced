Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism.

In this paper, we analyze the redundancy\ndifferences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively\non visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy\nthat explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal\ninformational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning\nstrategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual\ntokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual\nmodalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained\ntokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the\nexpected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently\nwith a greedy algorithm.

A detailed gradient\nanalysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the\nclassical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic\nroles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging\nmathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as\nPPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance.

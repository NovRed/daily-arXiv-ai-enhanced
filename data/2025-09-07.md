### [1] [Towards Efficient General Feature Prediction in Masked Skeleton Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03609)
*Shengkai Sun,Zefan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong,Zhiyong Cheng,Xiaojun Chang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GFP framework replaces low-level reconstruction with high-level feature prediction for efficient masked skeleton modeling, achieving faster training and state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAE approaches for skeleton-based action recognition use raw joint coordinates or simple variants, causing computational redundancy and limited semantic representation.

Method: Proposes General Feature Prediction (GFP) with collaborative learning framework where lightweight target generation network produces diversified supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, using constrained optimization to ensure feature diversity.

Result: 6.2x faster training than standard methods, achieves state-of-the-art performance on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets.

Conclusion: GFP framework provides computational efficiency and superior representation quality for skeleton-based action recognition through high-level feature prediction.

Abstract: Recent advances in the masked autoencoder (MAE) paradigm have significantly
propelled self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. However, most
existing approaches limit reconstruction targets to raw joint coordinates or
their simple variants, resulting in computational redundancy and limited
semantic representation. To address this, we propose a novel General Feature
Prediction framework (GFP) for efficient mask skeleton modeling. Our key
innovation is replacing conventional low-level reconstruction with high-level
feature prediction that spans from local motion patterns to global semantic
representations. Specifically, we introduce a collaborative learning framework
where a lightweight target generation network dynamically produces diversified
supervision signals across spatial-temporal hierarchies, avoiding reliance on
pre-computed offline features. The framework incorporates constrained
optimization to ensure feature diversity while preventing model collapse.
Experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD demonstrate the benefits
of our approach: Computational efficiency (with 6.2$\times$ faster training
than standard masked skeleton modeling methods) and superior representation
quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance in various downstream tasks.

### [2] [Teacher-Student Model for Detecting and Classifying Mitosis in the MIDOG 2025 Challenge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03614)
*Seungho Choe,Xiaoli Qin,Abubakr Shafique,Amanda Dy,Susan Done,Dimitrios Androutsos,April Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based mitosis detection using teacher-student UNet with domain generalization for robust segmentation and classification across different tissue domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual mitosis counting is time-consuming and suffers from inter-observer variability. AI solutions face challenges with domain shift (organ/species/staining variations) and severe class imbalance between mitotic figures and normal nuclei.

Method: Pixel-level segmentation approach using UNet backbone with domain generalization modules (contrastive learning and domain-adversarial training). Teacher-student strategy generates pseudo-masks for mitoses, hard negatives, and normal nuclei. Multi-scale CNN classifier leverages segmentation features in multi-task learning.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.7660 for mitosis detection (Track 1) and balanced accuracy of 0.8414 for atypical mitosis classification (Track 2) on preliminary test set.

Conclusion: The integrated segmentation-based detection and classification framework effectively addresses domain shift and class imbalance, providing robust mitosis analysis with consistent performance across different domains.

Abstract: Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to
inter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by
automatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.
However, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in
performance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,
including morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in
staining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the
count of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the
detection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level
segmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses
mitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our
method is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain
generalization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and
domain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate
pixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but
also for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving
robustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a
multi-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation
model within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the
algorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of
0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating
segmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for
robust mitosis analysis.

### [3] [Multi Attribute Bias Mitigation via Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03616)
*Rajeev Ranjan Dwivedi,Ankur Kumar,Vinod K Kurmi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMBM is a two-stage framework that addresses multiple overlapping biases in vision models by first learning to recognize biases through adaptive integration, then pruning bias directions via gradient suppression, resulting in improved worst-group accuracy and reduced bias amplification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world images contain multiple overlapping biases (textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, object pairings) that collectively impair vision model performance, undermining both robustness and fairness. Mitigating individual biases is inadequate as it often intensifies other biases.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL) trains encoders for each attribute and integrates them with main backbone to explicitly recognize biases; 2) Gradient Suppression Fine Tuning prunes bias directions from backbone's gradients, leaving a single compact network that ignores learned shortcuts.

Result: Validated on FB CMNIST, CelebA, and COCO datasets - boosted worst group accuracy, halved multi-attribute bias amplification, and set new low in Scaled Bias Amplification (SBA) metric even as bias complexity and distribution shifts intensified.

Conclusion: GMBM is the first practical, end-to-end multi-bias solution for visual recognition that effectively handles multiple overlapping biases while requiring group labels only during training and minimizing bias at test time.

Abstract: Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including
textures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases
collectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both
their robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves
inadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We
tackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a
lean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and
minimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)
deliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders
for each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the
classifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine
Tuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving
a single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to
recognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup
imbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias
Amplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias
amplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,
CelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute
bias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and
distribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end
multibias solution for visual recognition. Project page:

### [4] [Lightweight image segmentation for echocardiography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03631)
*Anders Kjelsrud,Lasse Løvstakken,Erik Smistad,Håvard Dalen,Gilles Van De Vyver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight U-Net achieves equivalent cardiac segmentation performance to nnU-Net with 16x smaller size and 4x faster speed through optimized components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time clinical measurements from echocardiography by reducing the computational burden of large nnU-Net models while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Method: Conducted ablation study to identify most effective nnU-Net components, then developed lightweight U-Net with simplified augmentations and deep supervision.

Result: Achieved statistically equivalent Dice scores (0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89) with 2M vs 33M parameters, 16x smaller model, and 4x faster processing (1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame).

Conclusion: Simple affine augmentations and deep supervision are sufficient for cardiac segmentation, enabling real-time clinical applications without performance loss.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle in echocardiography can enable
fully automatic extraction of clinical measurements such as volumes and
ejection fraction. While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are
large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective
components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study,
incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural
modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis
revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive
performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer
diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net
(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to
nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89
for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster
(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.
Cross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable
generalization.

### [5] [treeX: Unsupervised Tree Instance Segmentation in Dense Forest Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03633)
*Josafat-Mattias Burmeister,Andreas Tockner,Stefan Reder,Markus Engel,Rico Richter,Jan-Peter Mund,Jürgen Döllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Revised treeX algorithm for unsupervised tree instance segmentation from laser scanning data, offering resource-efficient alternative to deep learning with improved runtime and accuracy across multiple scanning modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning methods for tree instance segmentation require large annotated datasets and substantial computational resources, creating need for more efficient unsupervised alternatives.

Method: Revised version of treeX algorithm combining clustering-based stem detection with region growing for crown delineation, with parameter presets for ground-based (TLS/PLS) and UAV-borne (ULS) laser scanning.

Result: Reduces runtime and improves accuracy over original treeX, with F1-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data. Achieves F1-score of 0.58 for ULS data where original algorithm failed. Matches accuracy of recent open-source deep learning methods for TLS/PLS data.

Conclusion: Method serves as resource-efficient alternative to deep learning and enables semi-automatic label generation for training deep learning models. Open-source Python implementation provided in pointtree package.

Abstract: Close-range laser scanning provides detailed 3D captures of forest stands but
requires efficient software for processing 3D point cloud data and extracting
individual trees. Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods
for tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated
datasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient
alternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an
unsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region
growing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed
for personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one
for ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one
for UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public
datasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham
Woods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,
RayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original
treeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with
instance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.
For ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original
algorithm fails to segment any correct instances. For TLS and PLS data, our
algorithm achieves accuracy similar to recent open-source methods, including
deep learning. Given its algorithmic design, we see two main applications for
our method: (1) as a resource-efficient alternative to deep learning approaches
in scenarios where the data characteristics align with the method design
(sufficient stem visibility and point density), and (2) for the semi-automatic
generation of labels for deep learning models. To enable broader adoption, we
provide an open-source Python implementation in the pointtree package.

### [6] [Reg3D: Reconstructive Geometry Instruction Tuning for 3D Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03635)
*Hongpei Zheng,Lintao Xiang,Qijun Yang,Qian Lin,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reg3D introduces a reconstructive geometry instruction tuning framework that uses dual-supervision with 3D geometric information as both input and learning targets, achieving significant performance improvements in 3D scene understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Large Multimodal Models excel in 2D visual understanding but struggle with 3D scene understanding due to reliance on text-only supervision, which lacks geometric constraints needed for robust spatial representations.

Method: Dual-supervision paradigm with complementary object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks in a dual-encoder architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to develop spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap, ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: Reg3D establishes a new training paradigm for spatially aware multimodal models by incorporating geometry-aware supervision directly into the training process.

Abstract: The rapid development of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has led to remarkable
progress in 2D visual understanding; however, extending these capabilities to
3D scene understanding remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches
predominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the
geometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.
In this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction
Tuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware
supervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that
effective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric
structures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that
inject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a
dual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input
and as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary
object-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder
architecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of
spatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,
ScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance
improvements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware
multimodal models.

*Seth Z. Zhao,Huizhi Zhang,Zhaowei Li,Juntong Peng,Anthony Chui,Zewei Zhou,Zonglin Meng,Hao Xiang,Zhiyu Huang,Fujia Wang,Ran Tian,Chenfeng Xu,Bolei Zhou,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantV2X is the first fully quantized multi-agent system for V2X cooperative perception that reduces computational load and transmission bandwidth while maintaining accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing V2X cooperative perception systems focus on accuracy but ignore efficiency, latency, and real-world deployability issues. Full-precision models have high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical for resource-constrained real-time environments.

Method: Introduces a unified end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and transmitted message representations, operating under low-bit constraints to reduce computational load and transmission bandwidth.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems, reduces system-level latency by 3.2x, achieves +9.5 improvement in mAP30 over full-precision baselines, and scales more effectively within strict memory budgets.

Conclusion: QuantV2X demonstrates the viability of fully quantized multi-agent intermediate fusion systems for real-world deployment, offering efficient and scalable V2X cooperative perception solutions.

Abstract: Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
offers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating
occlusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has
predominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the
crucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world
deployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,
which incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical
for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we
introduce \textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system
designed specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,
multi-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified
end-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and
transmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational
load and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit
constraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.
More importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X
reduces system-level latency by 3.2$\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in
mAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more
effectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict
memory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized
multi-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system
will be publicly released to promote research in this field:

TL;DR: EfficientNetB0 outperforms ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 for plant species classification using leaf venation patterns, achieving 94.67% testing accuracy with excellent generalization capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate deep learning architectures for automated plant species classification based on leaf venation patterns, which are critical morphological features with high taxonomic relevance.

Method: Used three deep learning models (ResNet50, MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0) on the Swedish Leaf Dataset containing 1,125 images from 15 species, evaluated with standard performance metrics during training and testing phases.

Result: ResNet50: 94.11% training accuracy but overfitted (88.45% testing, 87.82% F1). MobileNetV2: 93.34% testing accuracy, 93.23% F1 with good generalization. EfficientNetB0: best performance with 94.67% testing accuracy and all metrics exceeding 94.6%.

Conclusion: Deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, shows strong potential for developing scalable and accurate automated plant taxonomy tools using venation traits, with EfficientNetB0 demonstrating superior robustness in classification.

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of three deep learning architectures:
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNetB0 for automated plant species
classification based on leaf venation patterns, a critical morphological
feature with high taxonomic relevance. Using the Swedish Leaf Dataset
comprising images from 15 distinct species (75 images per species, totalling
1,125 images), the models were demonstrated using standard performance metrics
during training and testing phases. ResNet50 achieved a training accuracy of
94.11% but exhibited overfitting, reflected by a reduced testing accuracy of
88.45% and an F1 score of 87.82%. MobileNetV2 demonstrated better
generalization capabilities, attaining a testing accuracy of 93.34% and an F1
score of 93.23%, indicating its suitability for lightweight, real-time
applications. EfficientNetB0 outperformed both models, achieving a testing
accuracy of 94.67% with precision, recall, and F1 scores exceeding 94.6%,
highlighting its robustness in venation-based classification. The findings
underscore the potential of deep learning, particularly EfficientNetB0, in
developing scalable and accurate tools for automated plant taxonomy using
venation traits.

### [9] [LayoutGKN: Graph Similarity Learning of Floor Plans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03737)
*Casper van Engelenburg,Jan van Gemert,Seyran Khademi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutGKN is an efficient graph similarity method for floor plan layouts that postpones cross-graph interactions to the end, using differentiable graph kernels for faster inference while maintaining comparable performance to graph matching networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph matching networks for floor plan comparison rely on costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, making them slow for inference in applications like search, clustering, and visualization.

Method: LayoutGKN postpones cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint embedding architecture and uses a differentiable graph kernel as a distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings.

Result: LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks while significantly increasing the inference speed.

Conclusion: The approach provides an efficient alternative to traditional graph matching networks for floor plan graph comparison, with open-sourced code and data available.

Abstract: Floor plans depict building layouts and are often represented as graphs to
capture the underlying spatial relationships. Comparison of these graphs is
critical for applications like search, clustering, and data visualization. The
most successful methods to compare graphs \ie, graph matching networks, rely on
costly intermediate cross-graph node-level interactions, therefore being slow
in inference time. We introduce \textbf{LayoutGKN}, a more efficient approach
that postpones the cross-graph node-level interactions to the end of the joint
embedding architecture. We do so by using a differentiable graph kernel as a
distance function on the final learned node-level embeddings. We show that
LayoutGKN computes similarity comparably or better than graph matching networks
while significantly increasing the speed.

### [10] [Singular Value Few-shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03740)
*Taha Koleilat,Hassan Rivaz,Yiming Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP-SVD is a parameter-efficient adaptation method that uses Singular Value Decomposition to fine-tune only 0.04% of CLIP's parameters by adjusting singular values, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 21 datasets while preserving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting vision-language models like CLIP to fine-grained domains is challenging due to reliance on prompt engineering and high cost of full fine-tuning. Existing methods with additional components limit adaptation quality and compromise pretrained knowledge.

Method: Leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify CLIP's internal parameter space without adding modules. Only fine-tunes singular values of parameter matrices to rescale basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining the pretrained model structure.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets. Outperforms previous methods in both accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings using only 0.04% of total parameters.

Conclusion: CLIP-SVD provides an effective parameter-efficient adaptation technique that enhances performance while better preserving the model's generalization ability and original knowledge, with added interpretability through natural language-based analysis.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and
few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting
these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on
prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing
adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and
adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,
and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we
present \textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \textit{multi-modal} and
\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without
injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular
values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain
adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced
adaptation performance using only \textbf{0.04\%} of the model's total
parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD
achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10
biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and
generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural
language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP
adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

### [11] [STA-Net: A Decoupled Shape and Texture Attention Network for Lightweight Plant Disease Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03754)
*Zongsen Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed STA-Net with Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) for efficient plant disease diagnosis on edge devices, achieving 89% accuracy with only 401K parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of deploying high-precision deep learning models on edge devices for plant disease diagnosis, as existing attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition fail to capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex textures.

Method: Twofold approach: 1) Training-free neural architecture search (DeepMAD) for efficient network backbone; 2) Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM) with dual branches - deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and Gabor filter bank for texture awareness.

Result: On CCMT plant disease dataset: 89.00% accuracy, 88.96% F1 score with only 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs. STAM significantly outperforms baseline and standard attention models in ablation studies.

Conclusion: Integrating domain knowledge through decoupled attention (shape and texture) provides an effective approach for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI, enabling efficient and accurate plant disease diagnosis on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Responding to rising global food security needs, precision agriculture and
deep learning-based plant disease diagnosis have become crucial. Yet, deploying
high-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks
use attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly
capture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex
textures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a
training-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an
efficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the
Shape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches
-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other
using a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant
disease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)
reached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm
STAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention
models. Integrating domain knowledge via decoupled attention thus presents a
promising path for edge-deployed precision agriculture AI. The source code is

### [12] [SLENet: A Guidance-Enhanced Network for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03786)
*Xinxin Wang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Yinan Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepCamo dataset and SLENet framework introduced for underwater camouflaged object detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance through semantic localization and enhancement techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater camouflaged object detection is critical for marine ecology but remains underexplored due to optical distortions, water turbidity, and complex marine organism traits that hinder accurate identification.

Method: Proposed Semantic Localization and Enhancement Network (SLENet) with Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement module and Localization Guidance Branch to enhance multi-scale feature representation and generate location maps with global semantic information, guided by Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder.

Result: Experiments on DeepCamo dataset and three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating high generality for broader camouflaged object detection tasks.

Conclusion: SLENet effectively addresses underwater camouflaged object detection challenges and shows strong generalization capabilities across different camouflaged object detection scenarios.

Abstract: Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection (UCOD) aims to identify objects that
blend seamlessly into underwater environments. This task is critically
important to marine ecology. However, it remains largely underexplored and
accurate identification is severely hindered by optical distortions, water
turbidity, and the complex traits of marine organisms. To address these
challenges, we introduce the UCOD task and present DeepCamo, a benchmark
dataset designed for this domain. We also propose Semantic Localization and
Enhancement Network (SLENet), a novel framework for UCOD. We first benchmark
state-of-the-art COD models on DeepCamo to reveal key issues, upon which SLENet
is built. In particular, we incorporate Gamma-Asymmetric Enhancement (GAE)
module and a Localization Guidance Branch (LGB) to enhance multi-scale feature
representation while generating a location map enriched with global semantic
information. This map guides the Multi-Scale Supervised Decoder (MSSD) to
produce more accurate predictions. Experiments on our DeepCamo dataset and
three benchmark COD datasets confirm SLENet's superior performance over SOTA
methods, and underscore its high generality for the broader COD task.

### [13] [Fitting Image Diffusion Models on Video Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03794)
*Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple training strategy that leverages temporal coherence in video frames to improve diffusion model training, achieving 2x faster convergence and better performance without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models are trained on static images, which is information-deficient for capturing temporal dynamics, leading to slower convergence, limited distribution coverage, and reduced generalization.

Method: Proposes a training strategy that incorporates temporal inductive bias from continuous video frames into diffusion training, requiring no architectural modifications and being seamlessly integrable into standard pipelines.

Result: Achieves over 2x faster convergence, lower FID scores on both training and validation distributions, and improved generative diversity by capturing meaningful temporal variations. Optimization analysis shows reduced gradient variance.

Conclusion: Leveraging temporal coherence in video frames is an effective way to enhance diffusion model training, providing faster convergence and better performance while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures.

Abstract: Image diffusion models are trained on independently sampled static images.
While this is the bedrock task protocol in generative modeling, capturing the
temporal world through the lens of static snapshots is information-deficient by
design. This limitation leads to slower convergence, limited distributional
coverage, and reduced generalization. In this work, we propose a simple and
effective training strategy that leverages the temporal inductive bias present
in continuous video frames to improve diffusion training. Notably, the proposed
method requires no architectural modification and can be seamlessly integrated
into standard diffusion training pipelines. We evaluate our method on the
HandCo dataset, where hand-object interactions exhibit dense temporal coherence
and subtle variations in finger articulation often result in semantically
distinct motions. Empirically, our method accelerates convergence by over
2$\text{x}$ faster and achieves lower FID on both training and validation
distributions. It also improves generative diversity by encouraging the model
to capture meaningful temporal variations. We further provide an optimization
analysis showing that our regularization reduces the gradient variance, which
contributes to faster convergence.

*Yuheng Li,Yenho Chen,Yuxiang Lai,Jike Zhong,Vanessa Wildman,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVista3D is a multi-scale vision-language framework for 3D CT analysis that addresses radiologic diagnostic errors through joint local-global understanding and semantics-aware text alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologic diagnostic errors remain prevalent due to missed localized abnormalities, limited global context in 3D imaging, and variability in report language. Existing 3D vision-language models cannot jointly address precise detection, global reasoning, and consistent reporting needs.

Method: MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. It uses language model rewrites and introduces a Radiology Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment to address report variability.

Result: MedVista3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while also transferring well to organ segmentation and prognosis prediction.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in 3D radiology analysis by enabling joint disease detection and holistic interpretation through multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining.

Abstract: Radiologic diagnostic errors-under-reading errors, inattentional blindness,
and communication failures-remain prevalent in clinical practice. These issues
often stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and
variability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,
where clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them
requires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level
reasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,
existing 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,
lacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with
the variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports. We present
MedVista3D, a multi-scale semantic-enriched vision-language pretraining
framework for 3D CT analysis. To enable joint disease detection and holistic
interpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for
fine-grained representation learning within full-volume context. To address
report variability, we apply language model rewrites and introduce a Radiology
Semantic Matching Bank for semantics-aware alignment. MedVista3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot disease classification, report
retrieval, and medical visual question answering, while transferring well to
organ segmentation and prognosis prediction. Code and datasets will be
released.

### [15] [Causality-guided Prompt Learning for Vision-language Models via Visual Granulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03803)
*Mengyu Gao,Qiulei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaPL is a causality-guided prompt learning method that uses visual granulation to improve CLIP's performance on fine-grained recognition tasks by capturing subtle class differences through causal inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods show limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets, failing to capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes.

Method: Two modules: (1) Attribute disentanglement module using Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model to decompose visual features into non-individualized and individualized attributes; (2) Granule learning module that constructs visual granules by integrating attributes for recognition under two causal inference strategies.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show CaPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CaPL method successfully addresses fine-grained recognition limitations in CLIP through visual granulation and causal inference, enabling more discriminative text prompt learning.

Abstract: Prompt learning has recently attracted much attention for adapting
pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) to downstream recognition
tasks. However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only
show a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this
issue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual
granulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation
technique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to
capture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through
casual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An
attribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into
non-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized
attributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion
Model; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules
by integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal
inference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more
discriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental
results on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on
fine-grained datasets.

### [16] [EGTM: Event-guided Efficient Turbulence Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03808)
*Huanan Li,Rui Fan,Juntao Guan,Weidong Hao,Lai Rui,Tong Wu,Yikai Wang,Lin Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-based turbulence mitigation using event cameras with microsecond temporal resolution, achieving 710x smaller model size and 214x faster inference while improving restoration quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep-learning TM methods require high-capacity networks to learn from coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited frame-rate, leading to poor computational and storage efficiency.

Method: Proposes EGTM framework that extracts pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from event streams using the 'event-lucky insight' about correlation between turbulence distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams, enabling temporal lucky fusion.

Result: Significantly surpasses existing SOTA by 710x in model size, 214x in inference latency, and 224x in model complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art restoration quality (+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on real-world dataset.

Conclusion: Event cameras provide great efficiency merit for turbulence mitigation tasks, demonstrating the potential of event modality to fundamentally address computational bottlenecks in TM.

Abstract: Turbulence mitigation (TM) aims to remove the stochastic distortions and
blurs introduced by atmospheric turbulence into frame cameras. Existing
state-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple
degraded frames to find the so-called "lucky'', not distorted patch, for "lucky
fusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from
coarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited
frame-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event
cameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to
fundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous
imaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental
\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence
distortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,
build upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts
pixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy
turbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first
turbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world
event-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214
times and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity
respectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality
(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset. This demonstrating
the great efficiency merit of introducing event modality into TM task. Demo
code and data have been uploaded in supplementary material and will be released
once accepted.

### [17] [Focus Through Motion: RGB-Event Collaborative Token Sparsification for Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03872)
*Nan Yang,Yang Wang,Zhanwen Liu,Yuchao Dai,Yang Liu,Xiangmo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusMamba is a novel RGB-Event detection method that performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features to reduce computational costs while maintaining high accuracy by discarding low-information regions guided by event data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process all regions uniformly, including low-information areas (backgrounds in images and non-event regions), leading to high computational costs and suboptimal performance. Fixed token selection methods fail to adapt to varying sample complexity.

Method: Proposes FocusMamba with Event-Guided Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) to identify and adaptively discard low-information regions using event camera data, and Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) to effectively integrate complementary features from both modalities.

Result: Experiments on DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets show superior performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: FocusMamba achieves better balance between accuracy and efficiency through adaptive collaborative sparsification and effective multimodal fusion, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of
both modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)
uniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational
costs and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy
during feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token
sparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these
methods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the
retention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve
a better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which
performs adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and
efficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided
Multimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and
adaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging
scene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the
sparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed
to effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both
modalities. Experiments on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves superior performance in both accuracy and
efficiency compared to existing methods. The code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition (CZSFR) to handle unseen food categories by treating cuisines as attributes and ingredients as objects, addressing challenges like background distraction, role confusion, and semantic bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Food recognition needs to handle rapidly emerging new dishes, requiring zero-shot learning approaches. Traditional methods struggle with unseen food categories, motivating the development of specialized zero-shot food recognition methods.

Method: SalientFusion method with two components: SalientFormer (removes background redundancy, uses depth features to resolve role confusion) and DebiasAT (reduces semantic bias by aligning prompts with visual features).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on proposed benchmarks CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, as well as on popular general CZSL datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed Compositional Zero-Shot Food Recognition framework effectively addresses the unique challenges in food recognition and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Food recognition has gained significant attention, but the rapid emergence of
new dishes requires methods for recognizing unseen food categories, motivating
Zero-Shot Food Learning (ZSFL). We propose the task of Compositional Zero-Shot
Food Recognition (CZSFR), where cuisines and ingredients naturally align with
attributes and objects in Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL). However,
CZSFR faces three challenges: (1) Redundant background information distracts
models from learning meaningful food features, (2) Role confusion between
staple and side dishes leads to misclassification, and (3) Semantic bias in a
single attribute can lead to confusion of understanding. Therefore, we propose
SalientFusion, a context-aware CZSFR method with two components: SalientFormer,
which removes background redundancy and uses depth features to resolve role
confusion; DebiasAT, which reduces the semantic bias by aligning prompts with
visual features. Using our proposed benchmarks, CZSFood-90 and CZSFood-164, we
show that SalientFusion achieves state-of-the-art results on these benchmarks
and the most popular general datasets for the general CZSL. The code is
avaliable at https://github.com/Jiajun-RUC/SalientFusion.

*Bu Jin,Songen Gu,Xiaotao Hu,Yupeng Zheng,Xiaoyang Guo,Qian Zhang,Xiaoxiao Long,Wei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccTENS is a generative occupancy world model that uses temporal next-scale prediction to enable efficient, high-fidelity long-term 3D occupancy generation with improved controllability over ego-motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive approaches for occupancy world modeling suffer from inefficiency, temporal degradation in long-term generation, and lack of controllability over vehicle movement.

Method: Reformulates occupancy modeling as temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, decomposing temporal sequence modeling into spatial scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction using a TensFormer architecture with holistic pose aggregation for unified occupancy and ego-motion modeling.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

Conclusion: OccTENS provides an effective solution for controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while maintaining computational efficiency through its novel temporal next-scale prediction approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose OccTENS, a generative occupancy world model that
enables controllable, high-fidelity long-term occupancy generation while
maintaining computational efficiency. Different from visual generation, the
occupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic
evolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.
Recent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential
to predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from
historical observations, but they typically suffer from \textbf{inefficiency},
\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \textbf{lack of
controllability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the
occupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which
decomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial
scale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a
\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and
spatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To
enhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose
aggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy
and ego-motion. Experiments show that OccTENS outperforms the state-of-the-art
method with both higher occupancy quality and faster inference time.

*Stefan Stojanov,Linan Zhao,Yunzhi Zhang,Daniel L. K. Yamins,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly-supervised method for dense functional correspondence across object categories using vision-language models and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object function guides correspondence establishment as functional parts share shape/appearance similarities across categories, enabling better matching for tasks like shape reconstruction and robot manipulation.

Method: Leverage vision-language models to pseudo-label multi-view images for functional parts, then integrate with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to distill both functional and spatial knowledge.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline solutions using off-the-shelf self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models on synthetic and real evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly-supervised learning paradigm successfully establishes dense functional correspondence by combining vision-language pseudo-labeling with contrastive learning, demonstrating effectiveness across different object categories.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences across image pairs is essential for tasks
such as shape reconstruction and robot manipulation. In the challenging setting
of matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the
effect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences
should be established. This is because object parts that enable specific
functions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the
definition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and
propose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.
The main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language
models to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then
integrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to
distill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can
establish dense functional correspondence. Further, we curate synthetic and
real evaluation datasets as task benchmarks. Our results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach over baseline solutions consisting of off-the-shelf
self-supervised image representations and grounded vision language models.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-category and cross-dataset generalization while maintaining efficient inference and scaling across CLIP backbones.

Conclusion: Attn-Adapter provides an effective online few-shot learning solution that enhances CLIP's adaptability without the computational burden and overfitting risks of traditional fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models excel in zero-shot image recognition but

TL;DR: SPECS is a new reference-free evaluation metric for long image captions that combines CLIP's efficiency with improved specificity scoring, matching LLM-based metrics' correlation to human judgments while being much faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for long image captions have limitations: n-gram metrics lack semantic understanding, representational similarity metrics have low human correlation, and LLM-based metrics are too expensive for iterative development.

Method: SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity - rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones in long image captions, creating a reference-free representational similarity metric.

Result: SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments while being significantly more computationally efficient.

Conclusion: SPECS provides a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development, balancing strong correlation with human judgment and computational efficiency.

Abstract: As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard
evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though
efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity
(RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high
computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain
unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based
on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments,
but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development.
  We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS
metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new
objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing
incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source
LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more
efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint
evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at

Conclusion: Generative foundation models like ChexGen can transform medical AI by enabling more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable systems through synthetic data generation and augmentation.

Abstract: The scarcity of well-annotated diverse medical images is a major hurdle for
developing reliable AI models in healthcare. Substantial technical advances
have been made in generative foundation models for natural images. Here we
develop `ChexGen', a generative vision-language foundation model that
introduces a unified framework for text-, mask-, and bounding box-guided
synthesis of chest radiographs. Built upon the latent diffusion transformer
architecture, ChexGen was pretrained on the largest curated chest X-ray dataset
to date, consisting of 960,000 radiograph-report pairs. ChexGen achieves
accurate synthesis of radiographs through expert evaluations and quantitative
metrics. We demonstrate the utility of ChexGen for training data augmentation
and supervised pretraining, which led to performance improvements across
disease classification, detection, and segmentation tasks using a small
fraction of training data. Further, our model enables the creation of diverse
patient cohorts that enhance model fairness by detecting and mitigating
demographic biases. Our study supports the transformative role of generative
foundation models in building more accurate, data-efficient, and equitable

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding framework that leverages inter-view motion and content correlations to significantly improve compression efficiency while maintaining random access and backward compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multiview video enables immersive 3D scene reconstruction but has massive data volume, creating storage and transmission challenges. While deep learning-based video coding has succeeded for single-view/stereo videos, general multiview scenarios remain underexplored.

Method: Uses feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction conditioned on decoded independent-view motion features, with inter-view motion entropy model. Also employs disparity-free inter-view context prediction from decoded independent-view content features, combined with inter-view contextual entropy model.

Result: Outperforms traditional MV-HEVC standard reference software by a large margin in compression efficiency.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong baseline for future learned multiview video coding research, demonstrating effective exploitation of inter-view correlations for improved compression.

Abstract: Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive
3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and
transmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based
end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on
single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios
underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding
(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while
enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively
leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance
dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion
correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction
method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded
independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model
that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content
correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module
that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content
features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures
inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC
framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC
standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research
in this field.

*Minghui Zhang,Yaoyu Liu,Junyang Wu,Xin You,Hanxiao Zhang,Junjun He,Yun Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TopoSculpt is a novel framework for topological refinement of 3D tubular structures that addresses limitations of existing methods by using holistic modeling, topological integrity constraints, and curriculum refinement to achieve significant improvements in both geometry and topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing medical tubular structures rely on voxel-wise overlap measures that fail to capture topological correctness and completeness. Current topology-aware approaches are patch-wise and cannot guarantee global preservation or correct geometric errors during inference.

Method: TopoSculpt uses: (i) holistic whole-region modeling to capture full spatial context, (ii) Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct errors from coarse to fine scales.

Result: Substantial improvements on pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets: β₀ errors reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on CoW dataset. Tree length detected and branch detected rates improved by nearly 10%.

Conclusion: TopoSculpt effectively corrects critical topological errors and advances high-fidelity modeling of complex 3D tubular anatomy, demonstrating significant improvements in both geometric accuracy and topological correctness.

Abstract: Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional
conduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.
Accurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for
applications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial
connectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap
measures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.
Although topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown
promise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global
preservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological
refinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a
holistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)
first introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly
enforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a
curriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct
errors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging
pulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\beta_{0}$ errors
are reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on
the CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving
by nearly 10\%. These results highlight the effectiveness of TopoSculpt in
correcting critical topological errors and advancing the high-fidelity modeling
of complex 3D tubular anatomy. The project homepage is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pneumothorax can be life-threatening if undetected, and small cases may be subtle on chest X-rays, requiring automated detection to support radiologists.

life-threatening if undetected. Chest X-rays are the first-line diagnostic
tool, but small cases may be subtle. We propose an automated deep-learning

### [28] [ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951)
*Zhu Wenjie,Zhang Yabin,Xin Jin,Wenjun Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANTS uses MLLMs to create adaptive negative textual spaces for improved OOD detection, reducing FPR95 by 4.2% on ImageNet without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods lack understanding of OOD images and suffer from false negative labels, particularly degrading near-OOD performance.

Method: Leverage MLLMs to generate expressive negative sentences from OOD images for far-OOD detection, and create visually similar negative labels for ID classes to reduce false negatives in near-OOD scenarios with adaptive weighted scoring.

Result: Significantly reduces FPR95 by 4.2% on ImageNet benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: ANTS provides a training-free, zero-shot approach that effectively handles both near and far-OOD detection through adaptive negative textual spaces generated by MLLMs, offering high scalability in open environments.

Abstract: The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an
understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate
negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels
significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we
propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the
understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative
images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive
negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance
far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the
in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that
are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning
capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to
this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD
detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an
adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task
settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior
knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet
benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a
new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot,
enabling high scalability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMChange is a multimodal remote sensing change detection method that combines image and text modalities to improve accuracy and robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing remote sensing change detection methods rely solely on image modality, which limits feature representation, change pattern modeling, and generalization under illumination and noise disturbances.

Method: Proposes MMChange with three key modules: Image Feature Refinement (IFR) to highlight key regions and suppress noise, uses vision language model to generate semantic descriptions, Textual Difference Enhancement (TDE) to capture semantic shifts, and Image-Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) for cross-modal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and SYSUCD datasets demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal approach effectively enhances remote sensing change detection by combining image and text modalities, validating its effectiveness for robust change detection under various environmental conditions.

Abstract: Although deep learning has advanced remote sensing change detection (RSCD),
most methods rely solely on image modality, limiting feature representation,
change pattern modeling, and generalization especially under illumination and
noise disturbances. To address this, we propose MMChange, a multimodal RSCD
method that combines image and text modalities to enhance accuracy and
robustness. An Image Feature Refinement (IFR) module is introduced to highlight
key regions and suppress environmental noise. To overcome the semantic
limitations of image features, we employ a vision language model (VLM) to
generate semantic descriptions of bitemporal images. A Textual Difference
Enhancement (TDE) module then captures fine grained semantic shifts, guiding
the model toward meaningful changes. To bridge the heterogeneity between
modalities, we design an Image Text Feature Fusion (ITFF) module that enables
deep cross modal integration. Extensive experiments on LEVIRCD, WHUCD, and
SYSUCD demonstrate that MMChange consistently surpasses state of the art
methods across multiple metrics, validating its effectiveness for multimodal
RSCD. Code is available at: https://github.com/yikuizhai/MMChange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAC-MIL is a novel WSI classification method using spatial-aware correlated multiple instance learning with positional encoding and efficient MLP-based full instance correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address WSI classification challenges by incorporating spatial relationships between instances and achieving efficient full instance correlations without complex Transformer architectures.

Method: Uses positional encoding module based on instance coordinates (not sequence index) to handle spatial relationships and length extrapolation. Employs SAC block with MLP-based architecture for full instance correlation in linear time complexity.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets.

Conclusion: SAC-MIL provides an efficient, easy-to-deploy alternative to Transformer-based methods for WSI classification, offering superior performance while avoiding custom CUDA kernel requirements.

Abstract: We propose Spatial-Aware Correlated Multiple Instance Learning (SAC-MIL) for
performing WSI classification. SAC-MIL consists of a positional encoding module
to encode position information and a SAC block to perform full instance
correlations. The positional encoding module utilizes the instance coordinates
within the slide to encode the spatial relationships instead of the instance
index in the input WSI sequence. The positional encoding module can also handle
the length extrapolation issue where the training and testing sequences have
different lengths. The SAC block is an MLP-based method that performs full
instance correlation in linear time complexity with respect to the sequence
length. Due to the simple structure of MLP, it is easy to deploy since it does
not require custom CUDA kernels, compared to Transformer-based methods for WSI
classification. SAC-MIL has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the
CAMELYON-16, TCGA-LUNG, and TCGA-BRAC datasets. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multi-task learning framework for liver vessel segmentation in non-contrast MRI using auxiliary contrast-enhanced data during training to reduce annotation requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Liver vessel segmentation is crucial for analyzing vascular changes in liver diseases, but contrast-enhanced MRI sequences are not consistently acquired, while non-contrast images are more common but challenging to segment without large annotated datasets.

Method: Proposes a multi-task learning approach that leverages paired native and contrast-enhanced MRI data (with and without vessel annotations) during training to improve feature representation and reduce the need for annotated examples.

Result: Auxiliary contrast-enhanced data improves vessel segmentation accuracy even when not available during inference, with most significant benefits when few annotations are available for training. The approach also validated successfully for brain tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: An auxiliary informative imaging modality can effectively augment expert annotations and improve segmentation performance even when only available during training, demonstrating cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for
the computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide
spectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast
enhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not
uniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more
frequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale
annotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels
in liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data
available only during training to reduce the need for annotated training
examples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with
and without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary
data improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not
available during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few
annotations are available for training, since the feature representation
benefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to
augment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across
different domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert
annotations even if it is only available during training.

*Mohamed Insaf Ismithdeen,Muhammad Uzair Khattak,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt design significantly affects LMM performance in MCQA, with up to 15% accuracy variations from minor prompt changes. Promptception framework evaluates 10 LMMs across 61 prompt types, revealing proprietary models are more sensitive to phrasing while open-source models struggle with complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design for Large Multimodal Models in Multiple-Choice Question Answering remains poorly understood, and minor prompt variations can cause significant accuracy deviations, posing challenges for fair model evaluation.

Method: Introduce Promptception framework with 61 prompt types across 15 categories and 6 supercategories to evaluate prompt sensitivity in 10 LMMs (including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro) across 3 MCQA benchmarks: MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench.

Result: Proprietary models show greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing (reflecting tighter instruction alignment), while open-source models are steadier but struggle with nuanced and complex phrasing.

Conclusion: Propose tailored Prompting Principles for proprietary and open-source LMMs to enable more robust and fair model evaluation in MCQA tasks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in recent years, prompt
design for LMMs in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) remains poorly
understood. We show that even minor variations in prompt phrasing and structure
can lead to accuracy deviations of up to 15% for certain prompts and models.
This variability poses a challenge for transparent and fair LMM evaluation, as
models often report their best-case performance using carefully selected
prompts. To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework
for evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,
spanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects
of prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight
open-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:
MMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench. Our findings reveal that proprietary models exhibit
greater sensitivity to prompt phrasing, reflecting tighter alignment with
instruction semantics, while open-source models are steadier but struggle with
nuanced and complex phrasing. Based on this analysis, we propose Prompting
Principles tailored to proprietary and open-source LMMs, enabling more robust
and fair model evaluation.

*Han Huang,Han Sun,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou,Jiaquan Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SliceSemOcc - a novel vertical slice based multimodal framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction that addresses height-axis information neglect in existing methods through global/local vertical slices and SEAttention3D module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D semantic occupancy prediction methods overlook height-axis information when processing voxel features, and conventional channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting their ability to emphasize features at different heights.

Method: Extracts voxel features along height-axis using global and local vertical slices, uses global local fusion module to reconcile spatial details with contextual information, and proposes SEAttention3D module that preserves height-wise resolution and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height layer.

Result: Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy datasets show significant mean IoU improvement, especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories.

Conclusion: The proposed SliceSemOcc framework effectively addresses height-axis information processing limitations and demonstrates superior performance in 3D semantic occupancy prediction, particularly for small objects.

Abstract: Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic
occupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike
bird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D
plane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial
structures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the
vertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis
information when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style
channel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting
their ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these
limitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal
framework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract
voxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical
slices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained
spatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose
the SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through
average pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height
layer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy
datasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving
especially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation
studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc
framework.

*Solha Kang,Esla Timothy Anzaku,Wesley De Neve,Arnout Van Messem,Joris Vankerschaver,Francois Rameau,Utku Ozbulak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel method for detecting spurious correlations in vision transformers, showing training methodology impacts reliance on unintended patterns and identifying problematic ImageNet classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks can exploit unintended patterns in data, leading to correct predictions based on spurious correlations rather than meaningful features, which undermines model trustworthiness and generalizability.

Method: Proposed a novel detection method for vision transformers, conducting large-scale experiments on ImageNet using both supervised and self-supervised trained models to identify spurious correlations.

Result: Found that training methodology significantly impacts model's reliance on spurious correlations, identified specific ImageNet classes containing easily detected spurious signals, and provided exhaustive list of problematic images.

Conclusion: Call for caution in using identified problematic images in future research, demonstrated real-world applicability through breast mass classification case study, and emphasized the importance of detecting spurious correlations for building reliable ML models.

Abstract: Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based
computer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended
patterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on
incorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may
vary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In
situations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,
models can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for
making predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,
where patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually
coincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations
have become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable
machine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect
spurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network
architecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both
supervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale
experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed
method to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same
architecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the
model's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain
classes in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily
detected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious
signals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the
aforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research
efforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in
invasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world
scenarios.

TL;DR: Proposes Learning from Majority Label (LML), a novel multi-class MIL problem where bag labels represent the majority class of instances. Introduces Counting Network and Majority Proportion Enhancement Module to improve instance-level classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses real-world applications where only majority class labels are available for bags of instances, such as pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring.

Method: Uses a Counting Network to estimate bag-level majority labels by counting instances per class. Includes Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that removes minority class instances to increase majority proportion within bags.

Result: Superior performance compared to conventional MIL methods on four datasets. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of each proposed module.

Conclusion: LML is a valuable problem with practical applications. The proposed Counting Network with MPEM effectively solves this problem by enhancing majority class proportions and improving instance-level classification accuracy.

Abstract: The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)
problem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class
of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to
train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using
the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,
including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer
sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a
Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by
counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis
experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high
proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we
developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the
proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within
the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on
four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies
confirmed the effectiveness of each module. The code is available at

Conclusion: Provides an innovative solution for UAV monitoring applications using domestic chips, successfully addressing real-time response challenges in complex video surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance
technology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of
response delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient
deep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the
efficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time
requirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a
heterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon
accelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with
millisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts
a collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and
MLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card
parallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight
YOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming
a closed-loop control chain of "detection-tracking-feedback". Experimental
results demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame
comprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video

98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an

TL;DR: A novel re-ranking method for person re-identification that uses K-nearest Weighted Fusion to generate multi-view features from neighbors, improving accuracy without model fine-tuning or extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous re-identification methods rely on single-view images which suffer from view bias, pose variation, viewpoint changes, and occlusions. Multi-view features can help reduce these issues and improve re-ranking accuracy.

Method: Proposes K-nearest Weighted Fusion (KWF) method to aggregate neighbors' features in an unsupervised manner to generate multi-view features. Explores weight selection strategies during feature aggregation without requiring model fine-tuning or additional annotations.

Result: Significant improvements on challenging datasets: 9.8% Rank@1 improvement on MSMT17 and 22.0% Rank@1 improvement on Occluded-DukeMTMC. Also shows substantial computational efficiency improvements compared to other re-ranking methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised re-ranking method effectively generates multi-view features through neighbor aggregation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple person re-identification datasets while being computationally efficient and annotation-free.

Abstract: In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the
overall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous
studies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can
cause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and
occlusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view
bias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates
multi-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted
Fusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from
re-identification models are highly similar when representing the same
identity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to
generate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight
selection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an
effective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning
or extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate
our method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and
Occluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves
Rank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking
results. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method
achieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:
MSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
demonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to
other re-ranking methods.

TL;DR: Proposes BiT and CATS modules for audio-visual video parsing, combining semantic injection with temporal graph propagation to address noisy pseudo-label issues and achieve SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AVVP methods either rely on noisy segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision or spread indiscriminate attention across frames, amplifying initial errors during training.

Method: Combines Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module for semantic injection and dynamic calibration of audio/visual features, and Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module for semantic propagation across time.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple key indicators across two benchmark datasets (LLP and UnAV-100).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively integrates strengths of previous research directions to locate and purify cleaner semantic cues while enabling precise semantic information dissemination.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) task aims to identify event categories and
their occurrence times in a given video with weakly supervised labels. Existing
methods typically fall into two categories: (i) designing enhanced
architectures based on attention mechanism for better temporal modeling, and
(ii) generating richer pseudo-labels to compensate for the absence of
frame-level annotations. However, the first type methods treat noisy
segment-level pseudo labels as reliable supervision and the second type methods
let indiscriminate attention spread them across all frames, the initial errors
are repeatedly amplified during training. To address this issue, we propose a
method that combines the Bi-Directional Text Fusion (BiT) module and
Category-Aware Temporal Graph (CATS) module. Specifically, we integrate the
strengths and complementarity of the two previous research directions. We first
perform semantic injection and dynamic calibration on audio and visual modality
features through the BiT module, to locate and purify cleaner and richer
semantic cues. Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and
connection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark
datasets, LLP and UnAV-100.

*Mustafa Sakhai,Kaung Sithu,Min Khant Soe Oke,Maciej Wielgosz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DVS-PedX is a neuromorphic dataset for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention analysis using event cameras, featuring both synthetic (CARLA) and real-world (JAAD-v2e) event streams with paired RGB frames and labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer low latency, high dynamic range, and motion robustness for pedestrian safety applications, but lack comprehensive datasets for pedestrian crossing-intention analysis in varied conditions.

Method: Created dataset with two sources: synthetic event streams from CARLA simulator with controlled scenes, and real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using v2e tool. Includes paired RGB frames, DVS event frames, and frame-level labels.

Result: Provides baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly, demonstrating dataset usability and revealing a sim-to-real gap that motivates domain adaptation and multimodal fusion approaches.

Conclusion: DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception by providing a comprehensive dataset with both synthetic and real-world event streams.

Abstract: Event cameras like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) report micro-timed brightness
changes instead of full frames, offering low latency, high dynamic range, and
motion robustness. DVS-PedX (Dynamic Vision Sensor Pedestrian eXploration) is a
neuromorphic dataset designed for pedestrian detection and crossing-intention
analysis in normal and adverse weather conditions across two complementary
sources: (1) synthetic event streams generated in the CARLA simulator for
controlled "approach-cross" scenes under varied weather and lighting; and (2)
real-world JAAD dash-cam videos converted to event streams using the v2e tool,
preserving natural behaviors and backgrounds. Each sequence includes paired RGB
frames, per-frame DVS "event frames" (33 ms accumulations), and frame-level
labels (crossing vs. not crossing). We also provide raw AEDAT 2.0/AEDAT 4.0
event files and AVI DVS video files and metadata for flexible re-processing.
Baseline spiking neural networks (SNNs) using SpikingJelly illustrate dataset
usability and reveal a sim-to-real gap, motivating domain adaptation and
multimodal fusion. DVS-PedX aims to accelerate research in event-based
pedestrian safety, intention prediction, and neuromorphic perception.

*Ayan Banerjee,Josep Lladós,Umapada Pal,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaleDiffusion is a novel framework for text-to-story visualization that maintains character consistency across frames and accurately renders dialogues through iterative processing and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with character consistency, leading to artifacts and inaccurate dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling in multi-character visual narratives.

Method: Uses pre-trained LLM for frame descriptions, character details, and dialogues via in-context learning. Implements bounded attention-based per-box mask technique, identity-consistent self-attention for character consistency, region-aware cross-attention for object placement, and CLIPSeg for dialogue bubble assignment.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue rendering, demonstrating superior performance in generating coherent multi-character stories.

Conclusion: TaleDiffusion effectively addresses key challenges in text-to-story visualization by maintaining character consistency and accurate dialogue assignment through innovative attention mechanisms and postprocessing techniques.

Abstract: Text-to-story visualization is challenging due to the need for consistent
interaction among multiple characters across frames. Existing methods struggle
with character consistency, leading to artifact generation and inaccurate
dialogue rendering, which results in disjointed storytelling. In response, we
introduce TaleDiffusion, a novel framework for generating multi-character
stories with an iterative process, maintaining character consistency, and
accurate dialogue assignment via postprocessing. Given a story, we use a
pre-trained LLM to generate per-frame descriptions, character details, and
dialogues via in-context learning, followed by a bounded attention-based
per-box mask technique to control character interactions and minimize
artifacts. We then apply an identity-consistent self-attention mechanism to
ensure character consistency across frames and region-aware cross-attention for
precise object placement. Dialogues are also rendered as bubbles and assigned
to characters via CLIPSeg. Experimental results demonstrate that TaleDiffusion
outperforms existing methods in consistency, noise reduction, and dialogue
rendering.

*Yuan Zhao,Liu Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEPG is a framework that uses LLMs to decompose prompts into spatial coordinates and style instructions, then employs specialized expert models for different image regions to improve complex multi-element text-to-image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models struggle with complex multi-element prompts and limited stylistic diversity, needing a better approach to handle spatial relationships and diverse styles.

Method: Uses a Position-Style-Aware LLM module to decompose prompts into spatial coordinates and style instructions, plus a Multi-Expert Diffusion module with attention-based gating to route specialized experts (realism, stylization) to different image regions.

Result: MEPG significantly outperforms baseline models with the same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.

Conclusion: The framework provides strong extensibility through lightweight expert integration and enables real-time spatial layout editing with per-region style selection from expert portfolios.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable image quality, but
they still struggle with complex, multiele ment prompts, and limited stylistic
diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and
Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and
style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.
The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)
module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts
into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and
(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera
tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.
During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,
realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each
spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture
supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing
strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time
spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of
experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models
with the same backbone in both image quality
  and style diversity.

*Orlando Castaneda,Kevin So-Tang,Kshitij Gurung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Better hyperparameter tuning of a simple baseline deepfake detection approach achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark, competing with commercial detectors and improving previous baseline results by 18%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detectors perform poorly on realistic 'in-the-wild' benchmarks, with open-source models significantly lagging behind commercial solutions (61-69% vs 82% accuracy).

Method: Revisits and improves a baseline approach by Ojha et al. that adapts standard pretrained vision backbones, focusing on better hyperparameter tuning rather than complex architectural changes.

Result: Achieves 81% accuracy on Deepfake-Eval-2024 benchmark, representing an 18% improvement over previously reported baseline results and competitive performance with leading commercial detectors.

Conclusion: Simple approaches with proper hyperparameter tuning can achieve state-of-the-art deepfake detection performance, making practical deployment more feasible by balancing accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of synthetic media demands accessible deepfake
detectors and realistic benchmarks. While most existing research evaluates
deepfake detectors on highly controlled datasets, we focus on the recently
released "in-the-wild" benchmark, Deepfake-Eval-2024. Initial reporting on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 showed that three finetuned open-source models achieve
accuracies between 61% and 69%, significantly lagging behind the leading
commercial deepfake detector with 82% accuracy. Our work revisits one of these
baseline approaches, originally introduced by Ojha et al., which adapts
standard pretrained vision backbones to produce generalizable deepfake
detectors. We demonstrate that with better-tuned hyperparameters, this simple
approach actually yields much higher performance -- 81% accuracy on
Deepfake-Eval-2024 -- surpassing the previously reported accuracy of this
baseline approach by 18% and competing with commercial deepfake detectors. We
discuss tradeoffs in accuracy, computational costs, and interpretability,
focusing on how practical these deepfake detectors might be when deployed in
real-world settings. Our code can be found at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ensemble of YOLO models combining visible and thermal imagery improves wind turbine defect detection accuracy over single models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAVs with advanced sensors enable wind power plant monitoring but require high-resolution data processing methods for reliable defect detection

Method: Developed ensemble approach integrating general-purpose YOLOv8 with specialized thermal model using bounding box fusion algorithm to combine predictions from visible and thermal channels

Result: Achieved mAP@.5 of 0.93 and F1-score of 0.90, outperforming standalone YOLOv8 model (mAP@.5 of 0.91)

Conclusion: Combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides more reliable solution for detecting both visual and thermal defects

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with advanced sensors have opened up
new opportunities for monitoring wind power plants, including blades, towers,
and other critical components. However, reliable defect detection requires
high-resolution data and efficient methods to process multispectral imagery. In
this research, we aim to enhance defect detection accuracy through the
development of an ensemble of YOLO-based deep learning models that integrate
both visible and thermal channels. We propose an ensemble approach that
integrates a general-purpose YOLOv8 model with a specialized thermal model,
using a sophisticated bounding box fusion algorithm to combine their
predictions. Our experiments show this approach achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.93 and an F1-score of 0.90, outperforming a standalone
YOLOv8 model, which scored an mAP@.5 of 0.91. These findings demonstrate that
combining multiple YOLO architectures with fused multispectral data provides a
more reliable solution, improving the detection of both visual and thermal
defects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisioFirm is an open-source web application that uses AI-assisted automation to streamline image labeling, reducing manual annotation effort by up to 90% while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image annotation tools require extensive manual input, which limits scalability for large datasets and makes the annotation process labor-intensive.

Method: Integrates state-of-the-art foundation models (CLIP, Ultralytics detectors, Grounding DINO) with a filtering pipeline, low-confidence thresholding for recall maximization, interactive refinement tools, and WebGPU-accelerated segmentation using Segment Anything.

Result: Demonstrates up to 90% reduction in manual effort while maintaining high annotation accuracy through benchmarks on diverse datasets, with initial predictions proven mostly correct for COCO-type classes.

Conclusion: VisioFirm provides an efficient, accessible solution for image annotation that combines AI automation with human refinement capabilities, supporting multiple export formats and offline operation after model caching.

Abstract: AI models rely on annotated data to learn pattern and perform prediction.
Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels
ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object
detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation.
Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability
for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web
application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted
automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an
interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This
hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like
Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding
DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence
thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on
COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct
though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding
boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has
on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU
for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO,
COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing
accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort
through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation
accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and
IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from

*Ruohong Yang,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DUDE is a novel unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval method that uses text-to-image generative models to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UCIR methods struggle with domain gaps because object features are entangled with domain-specific styles, making cross-domain retrieval challenging without annotations.

Method: DUDE leverages text-to-image generative models to disentangle object features from domain styles, then progressively aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains for reliable feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets spanning 13 different domains.

Conclusion: Feature disentanglement through generative models combined with progressive cross-domain alignment effectively addresses the domain gap problem in unsupervised image retrieval.

Abstract: Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (UCIR) aims to retrieve images of
the same category across diverse domains without relying on annotations.
Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image,
often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for
retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this
challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature
disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to
disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating
semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the
disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains
to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets
over 13 domains. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LASER is a self-evolving framework that enhances VLMs' multi-step perception for precise GUI coordinate prediction using Monte Carlo quality estimation and IoU-based evaluation to improve accuracy and diversity in preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling VLMs to effectively reason over appropriate image regions remains challenging in GUI grounding, especially with high-resolution inputs and complex multi-element visual interactions.

Method: Integrates Monte Carlo quality estimation with IoU-based region quality evaluation to jointly encourage accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference data, guiding models to focus on instruction-relevant regions.

Result: Achieves 55.7 score on ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark with GTA1-7B, establishing new state-of-the-art among 7B-scale models, with consistent performance gains on ScreenSpot Pro and ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: LASER framework effectively endows VLMs with multi-step perception capabilities for precise coordinate prediction, demonstrating superior performance in GUI grounding tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in
bridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model
introduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception
capabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling
VLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core
challenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and
complex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a
self-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step
perception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,
our approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with
Intersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly
encourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference
data. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on
instruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps
based on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER
achieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.

### [48] [Differential Morphological Profile Neural Networks for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04268)
*David Huangal,J. Alex Hurt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating multi-scale shape features (DMP) into semantic segmentation networks improves performance on overhead remote sensing imagery by addressing scale variation and shape information challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery faces challenges like extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes that standard networks designed for ground-perspective photos don't address well.

Method: Incorporated Differential Morphological Profile (DMP) features into three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using both direct input (adapting input stems) and hybrid dual-stream designs that fuse RGB and DMP encoders.

Result: Hybrid DMP architectures consistently outperformed direct-input variants and were capable of surpassing non-DMP models on mIoU, F1, and Recall metrics using the iSAID benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: Multi-scale shape features from DMP provide critical shape information that enhances semantic segmentation performance in overhead remote sensing imagery when properly integrated through hybrid fusion architectures.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications
in mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art
segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective
photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as
extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image
sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile
(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,
into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can
provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior
detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we
extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by
integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and
transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,
which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP
channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP
encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP
differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape
information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally
outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms
direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and
Recall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided 3D diffusion model synthesizes tau PET images using structural MRI and plasma biomarkers as multimodal inputs, providing a cost-effective alternative to actual tau PET scans for Alzheimer's disease monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tau PET scans are crucial for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis but are expensive and have limited availability. Structural MRI and plasma biomarkers offer more accessible alternatives but need integration for accurate tau pathology visualization.

Method: Proposes a text-guided 3D diffusion model that uses plasma p-tau217 measurements as textual prompts and structural MRI for anatomical constraints to synthesize 3D tau PET images.

Result: The framework generates realistic and clinically meaningful 3D tau PET images across various disease stages, validated using ADNI clinical data.

Conclusion: This approach enables tau PET data augmentation, offers a non-invasive cost-effective visualization method, and supports disease progression simulation under different biomarker and cognitive conditions.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of tau pathology via tau positron emission tomography
(PET) scan is crucial for diagnosing and monitoring Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, the high cost and limited availability of tau PET restrict its
widespread use. In contrast, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
plasma-based biomarkers provide non-invasive and widely available complementary
information related to brain anatomy and disease progression. In this work, we
propose a text-guided 3D diffusion model for 3D tau PET image synthesis,
leveraging multimodal conditions from both structural MRI and plasma
measurement. Specifically, the textual prompt is from the plasma p-tau217
measurement, which is a key indicator of AD progression, while MRI provides
anatomical structure constraints. The proposed framework is trained and
evaluated using clinical AV1451 tau PET data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can generate realistic, clinically meaningful 3D tau PET across a
range of disease stages. The proposed framework can help perform tau PET data
augmentation under different settings, provide a non-invasive, cost-effective
alternative for visualizing tau pathology, and support the simulation of
disease progression under varying plasma biomarker levels and cognitive
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that integrates spatial regularization and volume priors through Wasserstein distance constraints at both image and dataset scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing semi-supervised medical image segmentation networks overlook effective methodological guidance for feature extraction and important prior information from datasets.

Method: Integrates explicit volume prior at image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization from variational models into backbone segmentation network. Uses regression network to estimate target region volumes and enforces constraints through image-scale and dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss functions.

Result: Experimental results on 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset show superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages both spatial regularization and volume prior information to achieve improved semi-supervised medical image segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation,
most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance
for feature extraction and important prior information from
  datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image
segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization
methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong
explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial
regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone
segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are
estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone
segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint,
ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled
image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design
a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit
volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the
unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results
on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset
show the superiority of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised framework for learning articulated object representations from sparse-view, unposed images using only 4 views per articulation without camera supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of prior methods that require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, enabling articulated object representation learning under weaker input assumptions.

Method: Reconstruct each articulation independently using sparse-view 3D reconstruction, learn deformation field for cross-pose correspondences, use progressive disentanglement to separate static/moving parts, and jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and kinematics with self-supervised consistency losses.

Result: Produces accurate and detailed articulated object representations on standard benchmarks and real-world examples under significantly weaker input requirements than existing approaches.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables learning of articulated object representations from sparse, unposed images without camera supervision, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness under challenging input conditions.

Abstract: We present a novel self-supervised framework for learning articulated object
representations from sparse-view, unposed images. Unlike prior methods that
require dense multi-view observations and ground-truth camera poses, our
approach operates with as few as four views per articulation and no camera
supervision. To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each
articulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D
reconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense
correspondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further
separates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and
object motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and
kinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose
consistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples
demonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object
representations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic noise in image classification datasets where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled poses challenges to supervised learning. Synthetic images from text-to-image models provide reliable labels but have domain gaps when used directly.

Method: Proposes using synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets, rather than using them directly for training.

Result: Significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially semantic label noise. When combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust methods, achieves 30% improvement on CIFAR-10, 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses semantic label noise by leveraging synthetic images as reference points, is orthogonal to existing noise-robust techniques, and achieves superior performance when combined with them.

Abstract: Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar
categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to
conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the
potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models
to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with
reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps
and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel
method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify
and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves
classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in
challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method
is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with
state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior
performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100
under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise
conditions.

Method: Proposed a DINO-based model that significantly reduces computational requirements - using one third fewer parameters and achieving three times faster training compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Maintained competitive performance while achieving substantial efficiency gains. Also established a Multimodal Large Language Model baseline that revealed current limitations in structured visual reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed efficient DINO-based approach successfully addresses the computational challenges of odd-one-out anomaly detection while maintaining performance, and highlights the need for improved structured reasoning capabilities in multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoArena is an open platform that addresses data leakage and privacy issues in image geolocalization evaluation by using in-the-wild images and human pairwise judgments instead of exact coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image geolocalization evaluation suffers from data leakage (models pretrained on test data) and privacy concerns with exact coordinate metrics that neglect reasoning processes.

Method: Developed GeoArena platform that allows users to upload in-the-wild images and uses pairwise human judgments to evaluate which model outputs better align with human expectations.

Result: Deployed online for 2 months, collected thousands of voting records, established leaderboard comparing different large vision-language models on geolocalization performance.

Conclusion: GeoArena provides a more accurate, privacy-conscious, and human-centered benchmarking approach for evaluating image geolocalization capabilities of LVLMs.

Abstract: Image geolocalization aims to predict the geographic location of images
captured anywhere on Earth, but its global nature presents significant
challenges. Current evaluation methodologies suffer from two major limitations.
First, data leakage: advanced approaches often rely on large vision-language
models (LVLMs) to predict image locations, yet these models are frequently
pretrained on the test datasets, compromising the accuracy of evaluating a
model's actual geolocalization capability. Second, existing metrics primarily
rely on exact geographic coordinates to assess predictions, which not only
neglects the reasoning process but also raises privacy concerns when user-level
location data is required. To address these issues, we propose GeoArena, a
first open platform for evaluating LVLMs on worldwide image geolocalization
tasks, offering true in-the-wild and human-centered benchmarking. GeoArena
enables users to upload in-the-wild images for a more diverse evaluation
corpus, and it leverages pairwise human judgments to determine which model
output better aligns with human expectations. Our platform has been deployed
online for two months, during which we collected over thousands voting records.
Based on this data, we conduct a detailed analysis and establish a leaderboard
of different LVLMs on the image geolocalization task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FE2E is a framework that adapts image editing models (rather than text-to-image generators) for dense geometry estimation, achieving superior performance through structural priors, consistent velocity training, and joint depth-normal estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense prediction is inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting image editing models may be more suitable than text-to-image generative models as foundation for fine-tuning in geometry estimation tasks.

Method: Adapts Diffusion Transformer (DiT) editing model with consistent velocity training objective, logarithmic quantization for precision, and leverages global attention for joint depth and normal estimation in single forward pass.

Result: Achieves over 35% performance gains on ETH3D dataset, outperforms DepthAnything series trained on 100x more data, and shows impressive zero-shot performance across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Image editing models possess superior structural priors for dense geometry tasks compared to generative models, and the FE2E framework effectively leverages these capabilities for state-of-the-art performance without additional training data.

Abstract: Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative
models has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is
inherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather
than T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.
  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning
behaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our
findings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which
enable them to converge more stably by ``refining" their innate features, and
ultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.
  Based on these findings, we introduce \textbf{FE2E}, a framework that
pioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the
editor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow
matching loss into the ``consistent velocity" training objective. And we use
logarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's
native BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.
Additionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint
estimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their
supervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.
  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance
improvements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple
datasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset
and outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\times$ data.

*Feng-Qi Cui,Zhen Lin,Xinlong Rao,Anyang Tong,Shiyao Li,Fei Wang,Changlin Chen,Bin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MICACL is a novel multi-instance learning framework for dynamic facial expression recognition that addresses long-tailed distributions and spatio-temporal complexity through graph-enhanced instance interaction, weighted aggregation, and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DFER methods struggle with long-tailed category distributions and complex spatio-temporal feature modeling, leading to model induction bias and poor performance on minority categories.

Method: Proposes MICACL framework with: 1) Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction Module (GEIIM) for spatio-temporal dependency modeling using adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions, 2) Weighted Instance Aggregation Network (WIAN) for dynamic instance importance weighting, and 3) Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance major/minor category training.

Result: Extensive experiments on DFEW and FERV39k datasets show MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: MICACL effectively addresses long-tailed distribution and spatio-temporal complexity challenges in DFER through integrated multi-instance learning, achieving significant performance improvements on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due
to long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature
modeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER
performance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model
induction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates
spatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning
optimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction
Module (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances
relationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.
To enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance
Aggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance
importance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive
Learning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor
categories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and
FERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with
superior robustness and generalization.

*Dor Cohen,Inga Efrosman,Yehudit Aperstein,Alexander Apartsin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A computer vision pipeline that converts body-camera footage into panoramic images for rapid situational awareness by using SLAM for spatial reconstruction and multi-frame stitching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: First responders need quick visual summaries of incident scenes from body-camera footage, as reviewing lengthy videos is impractical in time-critical situations.

Method: Uses monocular SLAM to estimate camera trajectories and reconstruct spatial layout, clusters camera poses to identify key viewpoints, selects representative frames, and fuses them into panoramic images with multi-frame stitching.

Result: Produces informative panoramic images that summarize complex environments, enabling rapid understanding and efficient decision-making.

Conclusion: The pipeline effectively transforms body-camera footage into concise visual summaries that support quick interpretation and incident review for first responders.

Abstract: First responders widely adopt body-worn cameras to document incident scenes
and support post-event analysis. However, reviewing lengthy video footage is
impractical in time-critical situations. Effective situational awareness
demands a concise visual summary that can be quickly interpreted. This work
presents a computer vision pipeline that transforms body-camera footage into
informative panoramic images summarizing the incident scene. Our method
leverages monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to estimate
camera trajectories and reconstruct the spatial layout of the environment. Key
viewpoints are identified by clustering camera poses along the trajectory, and
representative frames from each cluster are selected. These frames are fused
into spatially coherent panoramic images using multi-frame stitching
techniques. The resulting summaries enable rapid understanding of complex
environments and facilitate efficient decision-making and incident review.

*Hao Ju,Hu Zhang,Zhedong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnomalyLMM is the first framework using Large Multi-modal Models for text-based person anomaly search, addressing fine-grained cross-modal alignment and sparse anomaly samples through a training-free adaptation approach with masked prompting and re-ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-based person anomaly search is crucial for public safety but faces challenges in fine-grained cross-modal alignment and sparse real-world anomaly samples. Current LMMs have untapped potential for this task due to domain gaps and lack of efficient adaptation strategies.

Method: Proposes a coarse-to-fine pipeline integrating LMMs with training-free adaptation techniques including masked cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware re-ranking to enable zero-shot anomaly detection.

Result: Achieves +0.96% improvement in Recall@1 accuracy on the PAB dataset compared to competitive baselines, with interpretable alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors demonstrated through qualitative analysis.

Conclusion: AnomalyLMM successfully bridges generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric anomaly detection, providing an effective zero-shot solution for text-based person anomaly search with interpretable results.

Abstract: With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has
emerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal
behaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,
this task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal
alignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly
recognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models
(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained
anomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between
generative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of
efficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose
AnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person
anomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline
integrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric
anomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked
cross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware
re-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study
to explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB
dataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly
search, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,
falling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1
accuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual
anomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code
and models will be released for future research.

*Yilin Tao,Jiashui Huang,Huaze Xu,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ASE-MLLM is a novel framework that integrates aesthetic saliency features into multimodal large language models for improved aesthetic image captioning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIC works using MLLMs don't specifically adapt models to focus on aesthetic content and primarily rely on fine-tuning without explicit aesthetic saliency integration.

Method: Proposes ASE-MLLM with Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM) to extract aesthetic features and IAS-ViT encoder that fuses aesthetic saliency with original image features via cross-attention mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly outperforms traditional methods and generic MLLMs on mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving SOTA performance.

Conclusion: ASE-MLLM is the first framework to successfully integrate image aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of
image aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of
computational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in
image aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.
However, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on
predicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.
Existing AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods
without specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To
address this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal
Large Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly
incorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce
the Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively
extracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design
IAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency
features with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the
best of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image
aesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods
and generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

*Jimin Xu,Bosheng Qin,Tao Jin,Zhou Zhao,Zhenhui Ye,Jun Yu,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D style transfer pipeline that uses 2D diffusion models to generate stylized key views with cross-view attention and instance-level consistency, achieving superior results compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D style transfer methods struggle with extracting high-level style semantics from reference images and often produce results lacking structural clarity and instance separation in 3D scenes.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Use diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints with cross-view attention for style fidelity and consistency, 2) Transfer stylized key views to 3D representation with instance-level style transfer.

Result: The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various scenes (forward-facing to 360-degree environments), producing more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylizations.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively integrates 2D diffusion priors with innovative cross-view attention and instance-level transfer mechanisms to achieve superior 3D style transfer with enhanced semantic understanding and structural clarity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields
and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer
to 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto
3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and
transfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.
Additionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and
separation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or
objects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from
pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,
we leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.
Then, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This
process incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style
alignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of
the UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures
that the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style
fidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style
transfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across
stylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in
a more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D
style transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree
environments. Visit our project page https://jm-xu.github.io/SSGaussian for

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtyINR is a self-supervised neural framework that simultaneously reconstructs objects and unknown probes in X-ray ptychography, achieving superior quality and robustness in low-signal conditions without requiring probe pre-characterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray ptychography's nanoscale resolution is limited by inaccurate image reconstruction when the illuminating probe is unknown, especially under low-signal conditions in low-dose and high-speed experiments, which compromises reconstruction fidelity and restricts broader adoption.

Method: Ptychographic Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR) parameterizes both object and probe as continuous neural representations, performing end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without requiring any pre-characterization of the probe.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate superior reconstruction quality on both simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging low-signal conditions.

Conclusion: PtyINR provides a generalizable, physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems, making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems beyond X-ray ptychography.

Abstract: X-ray ptychography provides exceptional nanoscale resolution and is widely
applied in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. However, its full
potential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing
images when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods
and deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the
low-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These
limitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader
adoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic
Implicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that
simultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By
parameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs
end-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without
requiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both
simulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging
low-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,
physics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,
making it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.

TL;DR: Proposes image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for real-world multimodal safety scenarios, generating 35k image-text pairs with standardized evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current risk-oriented dataset construction methods fail to cover the growing complexity of real-world multimodal safety scenarios, and lack unified evaluation metrics to prove effectiveness.

Method: Image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction starting with images and constructing paired text and guidance responses. Fine-tunes a safety judge model for standardized evaluation.

Result: Generated RMS dataset with 35k image-text pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and scalability of the image-oriented approach across various tasks.

Conclusion: The image-oriented approach offers a new perspective for constructing real-world multimodal safety datasets, confirming its scalability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly evolving, presenting
increasingly complex safety challenges. However, current dataset construction
methods, which are risk-oriented, fail to cover the growing complexity of
real-world multimodal safety scenarios (RMS). And due to the lack of a unified
evaluation metric, their overall effectiveness remains unproven. This paper
introduces a novel image-oriented self-adaptive dataset construction method for
RMS, which starts with images and end constructing paired text and guidance
responses. Using the image-oriented method, we automatically generate an RMS
dataset comprising 35k image-text pairs with guidance responses. Additionally,
we introduce a standardized safety dataset evaluation metric: fine-tuning a
safety judge model and evaluating its capabilities on other safety
datasets.Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed image-oriented pipeline. The results confirm the scalability
and effectiveness of the image-oriented approach, offering a new perspective
for the construction of real-world multimodal safety datasets.

*Zanwei Zhou,Taoran Yi,Jiemin Fang,Chen Yang,Lingxi Xie,Xinggang Wang,Wei Shen,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDT-dist framework accelerates 3D flow generation by distilling pretrained models to learn Marginal-Data Transport, reducing sampling steps from 25 to 1-2 while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based 3D generation models require many sampling steps during inference, and few-step distillation methods like Consistency Models have not been well explored for complex 3D tasks despite success in 2D diffusion.

Method: Proposes Velocity Matching (VM) to match velocity fields between student and teacher models, and Velocity Distillation (VD) to enhance optimization using learned velocity fields for probability density distillation.

Result: Achieves 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800 with 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s (2 steps x 2) latency while preserving high visual and geometric fidelity, significantly outperforming existing CM distillation methods.

Conclusion: MDT-dist enables TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation, demonstrating effective acceleration of complex 3D flow models while maintaining quality.

Abstract: Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps
during inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly
Consistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in
accelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex
3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for
few-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:
distilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly
learning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this
integral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two
optimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),
to equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the
velocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns
to stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but
inevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)
further enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity
fields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the
pioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of
each flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s
(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high
visual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables
TRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.

*Hyunsoo Cha,Byungjun Kim,Hanbyul Joo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Durian is a zero-shot method for portrait animation with facial attribute transfer using dual reference networks in a diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent facial attribute transfer from reference images to target portraits in animation videos without explicit supervision.

Method: Uses dual reference networks to inject spatial features from both portrait and attribute images into diffusion denoising. Trained with self-reconstruction formulation, mask expansion strategy, and spatial/appearance transformations for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer and enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass.

Conclusion: Durian effectively generalizes across diverse attributes and reference combinations without triplet supervision, demonstrating superior performance in zero-shot portrait animation.

Abstract: We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos
with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target
portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially
consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference
networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute
images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model
using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the
same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as
the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on
these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of
attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy
using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we
further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and
appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional
misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively
generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,
despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves
state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and
notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a
single generation pass without additional training.

*Benjamin El-Zein,Dominik Eckert,Andreas Fieselmann,Christopher Syben,Ludwig Ritschl,Steffen Kappler,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based segmentation method using differentiable Hough transform to detect collimator shadows in X-ray images, achieving robust reconstruction with median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts radiation exposure to ROI but collimator shadows can be obscured by scattered radiation, requiring accurate detection to minimize patient dose.

Method: Differentiable Hough transform-based network that detects collimation borders and extracts ROI center information, combining both tasks during inference for line-constrained segmentation masks.

Result: Achieved median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real X-ray images, demonstrating robust reconstruction of collimated regions.

Conclusion: The method effectively handles polygonal-shaped collimation shadows and is not limited by specific number of edges, providing accurate ROI detection for radiation dose minimization.

Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest
(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of
collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital
radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray
radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms
polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep
learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We
achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to
detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the
information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information
of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained
segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions
achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real
Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our
method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.

*Sabbir Mollah,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Qingyang Liu,Ahnaf Munir,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UCF-UM introduces a cyclic evaluation framework to measure semantic drift in unified vision-language models when alternating between image-to-text and text-to-image generation, revealing significant variations in cross-modal consistency that single-pass metrics miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for unified vision-language models assess understanding and generation capabilities in isolation, failing to reveal whether models maintain semantic consistency when cycling between modalities or if they can render concepts they understand.

Method: Proposes Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM) with three metrics: Mean Cumulative Drift (embedding-based semantic loss), Semantic Drift Rate (decay rate), and Multi-Generation GenEval (object-level compliance). Evaluates on ND400 benchmark from NoCaps and DOCCI datasets.

Result: Substantial variation in cross-modal stability across seven models - some like BAGEL maintain semantics over many alternations while others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores.

Conclusion: Cyclic consistency is a necessary complement to standard evaluations, providing practical metrics to assess unified models' cross-modal stability and strength of shared representations.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding
(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened
a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also
support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus
on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding
and generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider
these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such
as MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a
model that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is
preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we
introduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a
cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple
generations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean
Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;
(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)
Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending
GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in
training; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and
evaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in
cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many
alternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong
single-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary
complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics
to consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of
their shared representations. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for spatial intelligence in applications like VR, autonomous driving, and robotics requires addressing unique challenges of omnidirectional images that differ significantly from perspective images.

Method: Reviews panoramic imaging pipeline and projection methods, analyzes structural disparities, categorizes 300+ papers into cross-method analysis of strategies and cross-task comparison across four major categories.

Result: Comprehensive survey covering 20+ representative tasks with analysis of strategies to address panoramic-specific challenges like geometric distortions, non-uniform sampling, and boundary continuity.

Conclusion: Identifies open challenges and future directions in data, models, and applications to advance panoramic vision research, providing insights for developing panoramic vision technologies.

Abstract: Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,
omnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\textdegree{} field
of view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as
virtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their
unique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective
images in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,
making it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This
survey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on
the perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging
pipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for
analyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of
domain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform
sampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.
Building on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300
research papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method
analysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific
challenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task
comparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual
quality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal
understanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges
and future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the
advancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new
insight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of
panoramic vision technologies. Our project page is

*Kiymet Akdemir,Jing Shi,Kushal Kafle,Brian Price,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Plot'n Polish is a zero-shot framework for consistent story visualization that provides fine-grained control over image generation and editing at multiple detail levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models lack flexibility for applying both fine and coarse edits while maintaining visual and narrative consistency across multiple frames in story visualization.

Method: The paper introduces Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables consistent story generation with fine-grained control over story visualizations at various levels of detail.

Result: The framework addresses the challenge of maintaining visual and narrative consistency while allowing creators to modify images post-generation in a consistent manner.

Conclusion: Plot'n Polish provides enhanced control, refinement capabilities, and the ability to modify images post-generation while maintaining consistency, enabling creators to seamlessly craft and refine visual stories.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated significant capabilities to
generate diverse and detailed visuals in various domains, and story
visualization is emerging as a particularly promising application. However, as
their use in real-world creative domains increases, the need for providing
enhanced control, refinement, and the ability to modify images post-generation
in a consistent manner becomes an important challenge. Existing methods often
lack the flexibility to apply fine or coarse edits while maintaining visual and
narrative consistency across multiple frames, preventing creators from
seamlessly crafting and refining their visual stories. To address these
challenges, we introduce Plot'n Polish, a zero-shot framework that enables
consistent story generation and provides fine-grained control over story
visualizations at various levels of detail.

*Zehong Yan,Peng Qi,Wynne Hsu,Mong Li Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST-VL is a unified vision-language model for multimodal misinformation detection that achieves state-of-the-art performance through joint training across distortion types and a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal misinformation poses increasing societal threats amplified by generative AI, and existing methods struggle with generalization across different distortion types and unseen scenarios.

Method: Developed TRUST-VL with a Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module for task-specific visual features, trained on TRUST-Instruct dataset (198K samples) with structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking workflows.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and interpretability capabilities.

Conclusion: Joint training across distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances generalization, making TRUST-VL an effective unified solution for multimodal misinformation detection.

Abstract: Multimodal misinformation, encompassing textual, visual, and cross-modal
distortions, poses an increasing societal threat that is amplified by
generative AI. Existing methods typically focus on a single type of distortion
and struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios. In this work, we observe that
different distortion types share common reasoning capabilities while also
requiring task-specific skills. We hypothesize that joint training across
distortion types facilitates knowledge sharing and enhances the model's ability
to generalize. To this end, we introduce TRUST-VL, a unified and explainable
vision-language model for general multimodal misinformation detection. TRUST-VL
incorporates a novel Question-Aware Visual Amplifier module, designed to
extract task-specific visual features. To support training, we also construct
TRUST-Instruct, a large-scale instruction dataset containing 198K samples
featuring structured reasoning chains aligned with human fact-checking
workflows. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks
demonstrate that TRUST-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance, while also
offering strong generalization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFR is a novel video generation model that creates arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos using an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment approach with prefix video conditioning and anchor video consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable generation of minute-scale virtual try-on videos without requiring resource-intensive processing or lengthy video datasets, while maintaining both local smoothness and global temporal consistency.

Method: Auto-regressive segment-by-segment generation with prefix video conditioning for smooth transitions and anchor video (360-degree wholebody capture) for global consistency across segments.

Result: The VFR framework successfully generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with smooth local transitions and consistent global appearance under various motions.

Conclusion: VFR represents a pioneering approach to long virtual try-on video generation, solving key challenges of segment consistency and enabling arbitrary-length video creation without extensive computational resources.

Abstract: We introduce the Virtual Fitting Room (VFR), a novel video generative model
that produces arbitrarily long virtual try-on videos. Our VFR models long video
generation tasks as an auto-regressive, segment-by-segment generation process,
eliminating the need for resource-intensive generation and lengthy video data,
while providing the flexibility to generate videos of arbitrary length. The key
challenges of this task are twofold: ensuring local smoothness between adjacent
segments and maintaining global temporal consistency across different segments.
To address these challenges, we propose our VFR framework, which ensures
smoothness through a prefix video condition and enforces consistency with the
anchor video -- a 360-degree video that comprehensively captures the human's
wholebody appearance. Our VFR generates minute-scale virtual try-on videos with
both local smoothness and global temporal consistency under various motions,
making it a pioneering work in long virtual try-on video generation.

*Weizhi Chen,Ziwei Wang,Leyang Yang,Sheng Zhou,Xiaoxuan Tang,Jiajun Bu,Yong Li,Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PG-Agent transforms sequential GUI episodes into page graphs to capture complex transition relationships, uses RAG for retrieving GUI perception guidelines, and employs a multi-agent framework with task decomposition to improve generalization to unseen scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents fail to capture complex transition relationships between pages using sequential multi-step operations, limiting their ability to deeply perceive GUI environments and generalize to new scenarios.

Method: Automated pipeline to convert sequential episodes into page graphs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve GUI perception guidelines from the graphs, and a tailored multi-agent framework (PG-Agent) with task decomposition strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate PG-Agent's effectiveness, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Conclusion: The page graph approach with RAG and multi-agent framework significantly improves GUI agent performance and generalization capabilities to unseen scenarios.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents possess significant commercial and
social value, and GUI agents powered by advanced multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential. Currently, existing GUI
agents usually utilize sequential episodes of multi-step operations across
pages as the prior GUI knowledge, which fails to capture the complex transition
relationship between pages, making it challenging for the agents to deeply
perceive the GUI environment and generalize to new scenarios. Therefore, we
design an automated pipeline to transform the sequential episodes into page
graphs, which explicitly model the graph structure of the pages that are
naturally connected by actions. To fully utilize the page graphs, we further
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to effectively
retrieve reliable perception guidelines of GUI from them, and a tailored
multi-agent framework PG-Agent with task decomposition strategy is proposed to
be injected with the guidelines so that it can generalize to unseen scenarios.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
PG-Agent, even with limited episodes for page graph construction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Novel algorithm for computing tight probability bounds in quasi-Markovian causal models using column generation and linear integer programming, showing polynomial representation and superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of computing probability bounds in partially identifiable causal models where exogenous variables are not fully specified, making precise probability computation impossible.

Method: Develops a column generation approach using linear integer programming for scenarios with single interventions, exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables to simplify program construction.

Result: Demonstrates that polynomial cardinality representation for exogenous variables is possible, with experiments showing column generation techniques outperform existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm provides an efficient solution for computing tight probability bounds in quasi-Markovian causal models, offering significant improvements over traditional multilinear programming approaches.

Abstract: We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We
focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is,
each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder).
We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a
distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully
specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network
where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such
circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value
of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a
problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by
linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We
present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by
exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a
single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound
through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a
representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible.
Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing
methods.

*Tonghe Li,Jixin Liu,Weili Zeng,Hao Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Diffusion-AC, a novel autonomous conflict resolution framework that integrates diffusion probabilistic models to overcome unimodal bias in DRL approaches, enabling multimodal decision-making for safer air traffic management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches for Conflict Detection and Resolution suffer from unimodal bias, leading to decision deadlocks and lack of flexibility when facing complex dynamic constraints in air traffic management.

Method: Integrates diffusion probabilistic models into CD&R, modeling policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function to generate multimodal action distribution. Uses Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC) for stable training from sparse to high-density traffic environments.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. In high-density scenarios: achieves 94.1% success rate and reduces Near Mid-Air Collisions by 59% compared to best baseline, enhancing safety margin through flexible multimodal decision-making.

Conclusion: Diffusion-AC framework successfully overcomes unimodal bias in DRL for CD&R, providing high-quality multimodal action distributions that enable flexible conflict resolution and significantly improve safety in challenging air traffic environments.

Abstract: In the context of continuously rising global air traffic, efficient and safe
Conflict Detection and Resolution (CD&R) is paramount for air traffic
management. Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising
pathway for CD&R automation, existing approaches commonly suffer from a
"unimodal bias" in their policies. This leads to a critical lack of
decision-making flexibility when confronted with complex and dynamic
constraints, often resulting in "decision deadlocks." To overcome this
limitation, this paper pioneers the integration of diffusion probabilistic
models into the safety-critical task of CD&R, proposing a novel autonomous
conflict resolution framework named Diffusion-AC. Diverging from conventional
methods that converge to a single optimal solution, our framework models its
policy as a reverse denoising process guided by a value function, enabling it
to generate a rich, high-quality, and multimodal action distribution. This core
architecture is complemented by a Density-Progressive Safety Curriculum (DPSC),
a training mechanism that ensures stable and efficient learning as the agent
progresses from sparse to high-density traffic environments. Extensive
simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
outperforms a suite of state-of-the-art DRL benchmarks. Most critically, in the
most challenging high-density scenarios, Diffusion-AC not only maintains a high
success rate of 94.1% but also reduces the incidence of Near Mid-Air Collisions
(NMACs) by approximately 59% compared to the next-best-performing baseline,
significantly enhancing the system's safety margin. This performance leap stems
from its unique multimodal decision-making capability, which allows the agent
to flexibly switch to effective alternative maneuvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training LLM agents to dynamically decide when to plan during test-time, using supervised fine-tuning and RL, improves efficiency and performance on long-horizon tasks compared to always-planning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like ReAct require LLMs to always plan before every action, which is computationally expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning limits performance.

Method: Two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) reinforcement learning to refine this capability in long-horizon environments.

Result: Dynamic planning agents are more sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives in the Crafter environment. They can also be effectively steered by human-written plans, surpassing independent capabilities.

Conclusion: This work pioneers training LLM agents for dynamic test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making, enabling more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) to reason via reinforcement learning
(RL) significantly improves their problem-solving capabilities. In agentic
settings, existing methods like ReAct prompt LLMs to explicitly plan before
every action; however, we demonstrate that always planning is computationally
expensive and degrades performance on long-horizon tasks, while never planning
further limits performance. To address this, we introduce a conceptual
framework formalizing dynamic planning for LLM agents, enabling them to
flexibly decide when to allocate test-time compute for planning. We propose a
simple two-stage training pipeline: (1) supervised fine-tuning on diverse
synthetic data to prime models for dynamic planning, and (2) RL to refine this
capability in long-horizon environments. Experiments on the Crafter environment
show that dynamic planning agents trained with this approach are more
sample-efficient and consistently achieve more complex objectives.
Additionally, we demonstrate that these agents can be effectively steered by
human-written plans, surpassing their independent capabilities. To our
knowledge, this work is the first to explore training LLM agents for dynamic
test-time compute allocation in sequential decision-making tasks, paving the
way for more efficient, adaptive, and controllable agentic systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-SMILE is a perturbation-based framework that provides interpretability for Graph RAG systems by identifying influential graph entities and relations, improving transparency while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems improve accuracy but remain opaque black boxes, limiting reliability in sensitive domains like healthcare where precision and trust are critical.

Method: Developed a method-agnostic framework using controlled perturbations, similarity computations, and weighted linear surrogates to identify influential graph entities and relations in Graph RAG systems.

Result: KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned explanations and demonstrates strong performance across fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability, and accuracy metrics.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances model effectiveness with interpretability, enhancing transparency and trust in machine learning technologies, particularly for sensitive applications.

Abstract: Generative AI, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), has achieved impressive
progress but still produces hallucinations and unverifiable claims, limiting
reliability in sensitive domains. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves
accuracy by grounding outputs in external knowledge, especially in domains like
healthcare, where precision is vital. However, RAG remains opaque and
essentially a black box, heavily dependent on data quality. We developed a
method-agnostic, perturbation-based framework that provides token and
component-level interoperability for Graph RAG using SMILE and named it as
Knowledge-Graph (KG)-SMILE. By applying controlled perturbations, computing
similarities, and training weighted linear surrogates, KG-SMILE identifies the
graph entities and relations most influential to generated outputs, thereby
making RAG more transparent. We evaluate KG-SMILE using comprehensive
attribution metrics, including fidelity, faithfulness, consistency, stability,
and accuracy. Our findings show that KG-SMILE produces stable, human-aligned
explanations, demonstrating its capacity to balance model effectiveness with
interpretability and thereby fostering greater transparency and trust in
machine learning technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of reasoning under limited data and distribution shift by creating a principled evaluation framework based on causal models.

Method: Develops CausalARC testbed with tasks sampled from structural causal models, providing few-shot demonstrations with different causal feedback types (observational, interventional, counterfactual).

Result: Demonstrates utility across four evaluation settings: abstract reasoning with test-time training, counterfactual reasoning with in-context learning, program synthesis, and causal discovery.

Conclusion: CausalARC provides a formal framework for evaluating AI reasoning capabilities in causal understanding and adaptation to novel problem settings.

Abstract: Reasoning requires adaptation to novel problem settings under limited data
and distribution shift. This work introduces CausalARC: an experimental testbed
for AI reasoning in low-data and out-of-distribution regimes, modeled after the
Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). Each CausalARC reasoning task is
sampled from a fully specified causal world model, formally expressed as a
structural causal model. Principled data augmentations provide observational,
interventional, and counterfactual feedback about the world model in the form
of few-shot, in-context learning demonstrations. As a proof-of-concept, we
illustrate the use of CausalARC for four language model evaluation settings:
(1) abstract reasoning with test-time training, (2) counterfactual reasoning
with in-context learning, (3) program synthesis, and (4) causal discovery with
logical reasoning.

*François Olivier,Zied Bouraoui*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Embodied-LM is a neurosymbolic system that grounds LLM reasoning in image schemas (spatial cognitive patterns) using Answer Set Programming, improving logical deduction and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack robust mental representations for logical reasoning that humans possess through embodied cognitive structures like image schemas derived from sensorimotor experience.

Method: The system uses schematic representations based on image schemas and operationalizes them through declarative spatial reasoning in Answer Set Programming to guide LLMs in scenario interpretation.

Result: LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied cognitive structures, which can be formalized as executable programs that support effective logical reasoning with enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The prototype establishes a computational foundation for incorporating more complex dynamic representations, showing promise for bridging the gap between LLMs and human-like reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in natural language understanding, Large
Language Models (LLMs) remain error-prone when performing logical reasoning,
often lacking the robust mental representations that enable human-like
comprehension. We introduce a prototype neurosymbolic system, Embodied-LM, that
grounds understanding and logical reasoning in schematic representations based
on image schemas-recurring patterns derived from sensorimotor experience that
structure human cognition. Our system operationalizes the spatial foundations
of these cognitive structures using declarative spatial reasoning within Answer
Set Programming. Through evaluation on logical deduction problems, we
demonstrate that LLMs can be guided to interpret scenarios through embodied
cognitive structures, that these structures can be formalized as executable
programs, and that the resulting representations support effective logical
reasoning with enhanced interpretability. While our current implementation
focuses on spatial primitives, it establishes the computational foundation for
incorporating more complex and dynamic representations.

*Haozhe Wang,Qixin Xu,Che Liu,Junhong Wu,Fangzhen Lin,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL enhances LLM reasoning through emergent hierarchical planning, with HICRA algorithm focusing optimization on high-impact strategic tokens for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why RL improves LLM reasoning and address inefficiencies in current RL algorithms that apply optimization pressure indiscriminately across all tokens.

Method: Analysis of RL dynamics in LLMs, identification of two-phase learning process, and development of HICRA algorithm that focuses optimization on strategic planning tokens while using semantic entropy as a better exploration metric.

Result: HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines like GRPO, demonstrating that concentrating optimization on high-level strategic planning tokens is key to advanced reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RL success in LLMs stems from emergent reasoning hierarchy, and focusing optimization on strategic planning tokens (as in HICRA) with semantic entropy guidance is crucial for efficient learning of complex reasoning skills.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the
complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying
mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals
that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy
dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning
hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from
low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling
two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness
and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively
shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of
high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in
prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure
agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,
we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that
concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA
significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this
strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we
validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic
exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.

*Davide Italo Serramazza,Nikos Papadeas,Zahraa Abdallah,Georgiana Ifrim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Equal-length segmentation outperforms complex time series segmentation methods for SHAP-based time series classification explanations, with segment count being more important than segmentation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP's computational complexity limits its practicality for long time series, and while segmentation helps reduce computation time, the optimal segmentation strategy remains unclear.

Method: Investigated eight time series segmentation algorithms, evaluated using InterpretTime and AUC Difference metrics on multivariate and univariate time series, and introduced a novel length-weighted attribution normalization technique.

Result: Number of segments has greater impact than specific segmentation method; equal-length segmentation consistently outperforms custom algorithms; length-weighted normalization improves attribution quality.

Conclusion: Simple equal-length segmentation is sufficient for effective SHAP explanations in time series classification, and length-weighted normalization enhances attribution quality across different segmentation approaches.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become an increasingly important topic for
understanding and attributing the predictions made by complex Time Series
Classification (TSC) models. Among attribution methods, SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) is widely regarded as an excellent attribution method; but
its computational complexity, which scales exponentially with the number of
features, limits its practicality for long time series. To address this, recent
studies have shown that aggregating features via segmentation, to compute a
single attribution value for a group of consecutive time points, drastically
reduces SHAP running time. However, the choice of the optimal segmentation
strategy remains an open question. In this work, we investigated eight
different Time Series Segmentation algorithms to understand how segment
compositions affect the explanation quality. We evaluate these approaches using
two established XAI evaluation methodologies: InterpretTime and AUC Difference.
Through experiments on both Multivariate (MTS) and Univariate Time Series
(UTS), we find that the number of segments has a greater impact on explanation
quality than the specific segmentation method. Notably, equal-length
segmentation consistently outperforms most of the custom time series
segmentation algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel attribution
normalisation technique that weights segments by their length and we show that
it consistently improves attribution quality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaTeaming introduces personas into automated red-teaming to improve attack success rates by 144.1% while maintaining prompt diversity, bridging the gap between human and automated red-teaming approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated red-teaming methods don't consider the role of identity and background, which human red-teamers use to uncover different types of risks. There's a need to incorporate personas to explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies.

Method: Developed PersonaTeaming with persona-based prompt mutation using both expert and regular user personas, plus a dynamic persona-generating algorithm adaptive to different seed prompts. Introduced new metrics to measure mutation distance.

Result: Achieved up to 144.1% improvement in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art RainbowPlus method while maintaining prompt diversity. Different persona types showed varying strengths and limitations.

Conclusion: Persona mutation significantly enhances automated red-teaming effectiveness. The approach reveals opportunities for complementarity between automated and human red-teaming, with personas serving as a bridge between the two approaches.

Abstract: Recent developments in AI governance and safety research have called for
red-teaming methods that can effectively surface potential risks posed by AI
models. Many of these calls have emphasized how the identities and backgrounds
of red-teamers can shape their red-teaming strategies, and thus the kinds of
risks they are likely to uncover. While automated red-teaming approaches
promise to complement human red-teaming by enabling larger-scale exploration of
model behavior, current approaches do not consider the role of identity. As an
initial step towards incorporating people's background and identities in
automated red-teaming, we develop and evaluate a novel method, PersonaTeaming,
that introduces personas in the adversarial prompt generation process to
explore a wider spectrum of adversarial strategies. In particular, we first
introduce a methodology for mutating prompts based on either "red-teaming
expert" personas or "regular AI user" personas. We then develop a dynamic
persona-generating algorithm that automatically generates various persona types
adaptive to different seed prompts. In addition, we develop a set of new
metrics to explicitly measure the "mutation distance" to complement existing
diversity measurements of adversarial prompts. Our experiments show promising
improvements (up to 144.1%) in the attack success rates of adversarial prompts
through persona mutation, while maintaining prompt diversity, compared to
RainbowPlus, a state-of-the-art automated red-teaming method. We discuss the
strengths and limitations of different persona types and mutation methods,
shedding light on future opportunities to explore complementarities between
automated and human red-teaming approaches.

*Pengrui Han,Rafal Kocielnik,Peiyang Song,Ramit Debnath,Dean Mobbs,Anima Anandkumar,R. Michael Alvarez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show personality-like traits that stabilize with training but don't reliably predict actual behavior, challenging assumptions about AI personality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically characterize LLM personality across training stages, validate self-reported traits against behavior, and test intervention effects.

Method: Analyzed LLM personality across three dimensions: trait evolution during training, predictive validity of self-reports in behavioral tasks, and impact of persona injection interventions.

Result: Instructional alignment stabilizes trait expression and strengthens correlations similar to humans, but self-reported traits don't predict behavior reliably. Persona injection affects self-reports but not actual behavior consistently.

Conclusion: LLM surface-level trait expression differs from behavioral consistency, challenging assumptions about AI personality and highlighting need for deeper evaluation in alignment.

Abstract: Personality traits have long been studied as predictors of human
behavior.Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest similar
patterns may emerge in artificial systems, with advanced LLMs displaying
consistent behavioral tendencies resembling human traits like agreeableness and
self-regulation. Understanding these patterns is crucial, yet prior work
primarily relied on simplified self-reports and heuristic prompting, with
little behavioral validation. In this study, we systematically characterize LLM
personality across three dimensions: (1) the dynamic emergence and evolution of
trait profiles throughout training stages; (2) the predictive validity of
self-reported traits in behavioral tasks; and (3) the impact of targeted
interventions, such as persona injection, on both self-reports and behavior.
Our findings reveal that instructional alignment (e.g., RLHF, instruction
tuning) significantly stabilizes trait expression and strengthens trait
correlations in ways that mirror human data. However, these self-reported
traits do not reliably predict behavior, and observed associations often
diverge from human patterns. While persona injection successfully steers
self-reports in the intended direction, it exerts little or inconsistent effect
on actual behavior. By distinguishing surface-level trait expression from
behavioral consistency, our findings challenge assumptions about LLM
personality and underscore the need for deeper evaluation in alignment and
interpretability.

Motivation: To evaluate whether synthetic agents (LLMs) can truly substitute real human participants in research by examining if they maintain internal consistency across different experimental settings, rather than just matching human survey responses.

Method: Developed a study to reveal agents' internal states and examine their behavior in basic dialogue settings, testing behavioral hypotheses to assess consistency between conversation behavior and revealed internal states across different model families and sizes.

Result: Found significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across all tested model families and sizes. While agents can generate responses matching human counterparts, they fail to maintain internal consistency.

Conclusion: LLMs' internal inconsistency represents a critical gap in their capabilities to accurately substitute for real human participants in research, despite their ability to generate human-like survey responses.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

*Connor Walker,Koorosh Aslansefat,Mohammad Naveed Akram,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAGuard is an enhanced RAG framework that integrates safety-critical documents with technical manuals for offshore wind maintenance, improving safety recall from near 0% to over 50% while maintaining technical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LLMs fail in highly specialized or unexpected offshore wind maintenance scenarios where both technical accuracy and safety are critical requirements.

Method: Uses parallel queries to two indices (knowledge and safety) with separate retrieval budgets, plus SafetyClamp extension that fetches larger candidate pool with hard-clamping exact slot guarantees to safety.

Result: RAGuard increases Safety Recall@K from almost 0% to more than 50% while maintaining Technical Recall above 60% across sparse, dense, and hybrid retrieval paradigms.

Conclusion: RAGuard and SafetyClamp establish a new standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support for critical maintenance contexts.

Abstract: Accuracy and safety are paramount in Offshore Wind (OSW) maintenance, yet
conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail when confronted with
highly specialised or unexpected scenarios. We introduce RAGuard, an enhanced
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that explicitly integrates
safety-critical documents alongside technical manuals.By issuing parallel
queries to two indices and allocating separate retrieval budgets for knowledge
and safety, RAGuard guarantees both technical depth and safety coverage. We
further develop a SafetyClamp extension that fetches a larger candidate pool,
"hard-clamping" exact slot guarantees to safety. We evaluate across sparse
(BM25), dense (Dense Passage Retrieval) and hybrid retrieval paradigms,
measuring Technical Recall@K and Safety Recall@K. Both proposed extensions of
RAG show an increase in Safety Recall@K from almost 0\% in RAG to more than
50\% in RAGuard, while maintaining Technical Recall above 60\%. These results
demonstrate that RAGuard and SafetyClamp have the potential to establish a new
standard for integrating safety assurance into LLM-powered decision support in
critical maintenance contexts.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-agent applications in supply chain management, providing a practical solution that combines AI capabilities with domain expertise for improved planning outcomes.

Abstract: In supply chain management, planning is a critical concept. The movement of
physical products across different categories, from suppliers to warehouse
management, to sales, and logistics transporting them to customers, entails the
involvement of many entities. It covers various aspects such as demand
forecasting, inventory management, sales operations, and replenishment. How to
collect relevant data from an e-commerce platform's perspective, formulate
long-term plans, and dynamically adjust them based on environmental changes,
while ensuring interpretability, efficiency, and reliability, is a practical
and challenging problem. In recent years, the development of AI technologies,
especially the rapid progress of large language models, has provided new tools
to address real-world issues. In this work, we construct a Supply Chain
Planning Agent (SCPA) framework that can understand domain knowledge,
comprehend the operator's needs, decompose tasks, leverage or create new tools,
and return evidence-based planning reports. We deploy this framework in
JD.com's real-world scenario, demonstrating the feasibility of LLM-agent
applications in the supply chain. It effectively reduced labor and improved
accuracy, stock availability, and other key metrics.

*Wei Yang,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MPDF framework enables LLM agents to learn adaptive meta-cognitive policies (Persist/Refine/Concede) using novel SoftRankPO algorithm, achieving 4-5% accuracy gains over state-of-the-art multi-agent reasoning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems use fixed collaboration protocols that overlook agents' internal deliberative capabilities and treat them as passive executors, creating a meta-cognitive blindspot.

Method: Introduced Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF) with decentralized policy over meta-cognitive actions, and developed SoftRankPO algorithm using rank-based reward shaping with smooth normal quantiles for stable training.

Result: Achieved 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six state-of-the-art multi-agent reasoning algorithms.

Conclusion: Presents a paradigm shift from designing fixed protocols to learning dynamic, deliberative strategies for adaptive meta-cognitive policies in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems of large language models (LLMs) show promise for complex
reasoning, but their effectiveness is often limited by fixed collaboration
protocols. These frameworks typically focus on macro-level orchestration while
overlooking agents' internal deliberative capabilities. This critical
meta-cognitive blindspot treats agents as passive executors unable to adapt
their strategy based on internal cognitive states like uncertainty or
confidence. We introduce the Meta-Policy Deliberation Framework (MPDF), where
agents learn a decentralized policy over a set of high-level meta-cognitive
actions: Persist, Refine, and Concede. To overcome the instability of
traditional policy gradients in this setting, we develop SoftRankPO, a novel
reinforcement learning algorithm. SoftRankPO stabilizes training by shaping
advantages based on the rank of rewards mapped through smooth normal quantiles,
making the learning process robust to reward variance. Experiments show that
MPDF with SoftRankPO achieves a a 4-5% absolute gain in average accuracy across
five mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks compared to six
state-of-the-art heuristic and learning-based multi-agent reasoning algorithms.
Our work presents a paradigm for learning adaptive, meta-cognitive policies for
multi-agent LLM systems, shifting the focus from designing fixed protocols to
learning dynamic, deliberative strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show promise for social policymaking on homelessness, with alignment to domain experts across four global regions when proper guardrails are implemented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if LLMs can provide valuable insights for complex social policymaking, specifically homelessness affecting 150M+ people worldwide, and assess their alignment with domain experts.

Method: Developed a novel benchmark with decision scenarios across four geographies using Capability Approach framework, plus an automated pipeline connecting policies to agent-based models for social impact simulation.

Result: LLMs demonstrate promising potential for social policymaking when responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in collaboration with local domain experts.

Conclusion: LLMs can provide humans with valuable policy insights at scale for homelessness alleviation, but require responsible implementation with expert collaboration and contextual adaptations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted in high-stakes
domains. Their capacity to process vast amounts of unstructured data, explore
flexible scenarios, and handle a diversity of contextual factors can make them
uniquely suited to provide new insights for the complexity of social
policymaking. This article evaluates whether LLMs' are aligned with domain
experts (and among themselves) to inform social policymaking on the subject of
homelessness alleviation - a challenge affecting over 150 million people
worldwide. We develop a novel benchmark comprised of decision scenarios with
policy choices across four geographies (South Bend, USA; Barcelona, Spain;
Johannesburg, South Africa; Macau SAR, China). The policies in scope are
grounded in the conceptual framework of the Capability Approach for human
development. We also present an automated pipeline that connects the
benchmarked policies to an agent-based model, and we explore the social impact
of the recommended policies through simulated social scenarios. The paper
results reveal promising potential to leverage LLMs for social policy making.
If responsible guardrails and contextual calibrations are introduced in
collaboration with local domain experts, LLMs can provide humans with valuable
insights, in the form of alternative policies at scale.

TL;DR: A zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system using Model Context Protocol (MCP) to automate OMOP CDM medical term mapping, improving efficiency and accuracy without requiring model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual mapping of medical terms to OMOP standard concepts is resource-intensive and error-prone, and existing LLMs tend to hallucinate, making them unsuitable for clinical deployment without extensive training and validation.

Method: Developed a system based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework that allows LLMs to interact with external resources and tools for real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning, preventing hallucinations without requiring model training.

Result: The system enables explainable mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort, providing outputs suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Conclusion: The MCP-based system provides a practical solution for automated medical term mapping to OMOP CDM standards, addressing hallucination issues while maintaining explainability and clinical readiness without requiring extensive training.

Abstract: The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM)
provides a standardized representation of heterogeneous health data to support
large-scale, multi-institutional research. One critical step in data
standardization using OMOP CDM is the mapping of source medical terms to OMOP
standard concepts, a procedure that is resource-intensive and error-prone.
While large language models (LLMs) have the potential to facilitate this
process, their tendency toward hallucination makes them unsuitable for clinical
deployment without training and expert validation. Here, we developed a
zero-training, hallucination-preventive mapping system based on the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized and secure framework allowing LLMs to
interact with external resources and tools. The system enables explainable
mapping and significantly improves efficiency and accuracy with minimal effort.
It provides real-time vocabulary lookups and structured reasoning outputs
suitable for immediate use in both exploratory and production environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-powered framework analyzes tourist perception in historic urban quarters using social media data, combining visual focus, color analysis, and sentiment mining to inform urban planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand tourist perception in historic urban quarters for sustainable, human-centered urban planning and heritage conservation.

Method: Multimodal AI framework using social media data: semantic segmentation for visual focus areas, color clustering for aesthetic preferences, hybrid sentiment analysis (rule-based + multi-task BERT) for reviews across four dimensions.

Result: Identified spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and emotional response, revealed divergence between social media photos and real-world street views, showing gaps between visual expectations and built environment.

Conclusion: Integrated data-driven approach provides valuable insights for tourism management, heritage conservation, and designing aesthetically engaging public spaces.

Abstract: Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage
while serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding
how tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,
human-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional
AI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban
quarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic
quarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,
color theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified
from tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To
assess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering
method, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color
themes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street
views, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps
between visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both
stylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated
through a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and
a multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:
tourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business
formats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and
emotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this
framework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist
perception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage
conservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.

TL;DR: Proposes a systematic methodology using deterministic and LLM-generated Knowledge Graphs to monitor and evaluate Generative AI reliability in real-time, detecting hallucinations and semantic anomalies through structural metric comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative AI models present reliability challenges including hallucinations, semantic drift, and biases, but current evaluation methods rely on subjective human assessment which limits scalability and transparency.

Method: Constructs two parallel Knowledge Graphs: (1) deterministic KG using rule-based methods and predefined ontologies, and (2) LLM-generated KG from real-time textual data. Uses KG metrics (ICR, IPR, CI) to quantify structural deviations and establishes dynamic anomaly thresholds for real-time monitoring.

Result: The method enables continuous monitoring and proactive identification of significant deviations between deterministic and LLM-generated KGs, allowing prompt detection of semantic anomalies and hallucinations.

Conclusion: Provides a robust, scalable, and transparent evaluation framework for Generative AI reliability through structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic and dynamically generated knowledge graphs.

Abstract: Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.

TL;DR: E&E is a hybrid exploration strategy that combines local novelty search with goal-directed expeditions using vision-language models to discover diverse patterns in continuous cellular automata, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional novelty search methods often plateau in high-dimensional behavioral spaces of cellular automata, failing to reach distant unexplored regions due to local novelty exhaustion.

Method: E&E alternates between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions using a Vision-Language Model to generate linguistic goals describing hypothetical patterns, operating in semantic spaces aligned with human perception.

Result: E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than existing methods in Flow Lenia CA, with solutions from expeditions disproportionately influencing long-term exploration and unlocking new behavioral niches.

Conclusion: E&E effectively breaks through local novelty boundaries and explores behavioral landscapes in human-aligned, interpretable ways, offering a promising approach for open-ended exploration in artificial life.

Abstract: Discovering diverse visual patterns in continuous cellular automata (CA) is
challenging due to the vastness and redundancy of high-dimensional behavioral
spaces. Traditional exploration methods like Novelty Search (NS) expand locally
by mutating known novel solutions but often plateau when local novelty is
exhausted, failing to reach distant, unexplored regions. We introduce
Expedition and Expansion (E&E), a hybrid strategy where exploration alternates
between local novelty-driven expansions and goal-directed expeditions. During
expeditions, E&E leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate linguistic
goals--descriptions of interesting but hypothetical patterns that drive
exploration toward uncharted regions. By operating in semantic spaces that
align with human perception, E&E both evaluates novelty and generates goals in
conceptually meaningful ways, enhancing the interpretability and relevance of
discovered behaviors. Tested on Flow Lenia, a continuous CA known for its rich,
emergent behaviors, E&E consistently uncovers more diverse solutions than
existing exploration methods. A genealogical analysis further reveals that
solutions originating from expeditions disproportionately influence long-term
exploration, unlocking new behavioral niches that serve as stepping stones for
subsequent search. These findings highlight E&E's capacity to break through
local novelty boundaries and explore behavioral landscapes in human-aligned,
interpretable ways, offering a promising template for open-ended exploration in
artificial life and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex GUI navigation on C2C platforms creates time-consuming experiences for both buyers and sellers, requiring a more intuitive interaction model.

Method: Developed Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA) - an LLM-powered agent that interprets natural language commands to automate high-friction workflows like listing updates, bulk messaging, and conversational product search.

Result: FaMA achieves 98% task success rate on complex marketplace tasks and enables up to 2x speedup in interaction time compared to traditional GUI interfaces.

Conclusion: Agentic conversational paradigm provides a lightweight, accessible alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage marketplace activities with greater efficiency through natural language interactions.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic AI, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), marks a
paradigm shift from reactive generative systems to proactive, goal-oriented
autonomous agents capable of sophisticated planning, memory, and tool use. This
evolution presents a novel opportunity to address long-standing challenges in
complex digital environments. Core tasks on Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
e-commerce platforms often require users to navigate complex Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs), making the experience time-consuming for both buyers and
sellers. This paper introduces a novel approach to simplify these interactions
through an LLM-powered agentic assistant. This agent functions as a new,
conversational entry point to the marketplace, shifting the primary interaction
model from a complex GUI to an intuitive AI agent. By interpreting natural
language commands, the agent automates key high-friction workflows. For
sellers, this includes simplified updating and renewal of listings, and the
ability to send bulk messages. For buyers, the agent facilitates a more
efficient product discovery process through conversational search. We present
the architecture for Facebook Marketplace Assistant (FaMA), arguing that this
agentic, conversational paradigm provides a lightweight and more accessible
alternative to traditional app interfaces, allowing users to manage their
marketplace activities with greater efficiency. Experiments show FaMA achieves
a 98% task success rate on solving complex tasks on the marketplace and enables
up to a 2x speedup on interaction time.

TL;DR: DeepMedix-R1 is a transparent medical foundation model for chest X-ray interpretation that generates both answers and reasoning steps tied to image regions, showing significant improvements over existing models in report generation and visual question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical foundation models operate as black boxes without transparent reasoning processes, lacking interpretability which hinders clinical deployment. There's a need for models that provide both answers and clinically grounded reasoning.

Method: Three-stage sequential training: 1) fine-tuning on CXR instruction data for basic interpretation, 2) exposure to synthetic reasoning samples for cold-start reasoning, 3) online reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning quality and generation performance. Also developed Report Arena benchmarking framework.

Result: Substantial improvements: 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad/MedGemma in report generation; 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma/CheXagent in VQA. Expert review showed 0.7416 vs 0.2584 preference over Qwen2.5-VL-7B for interpretability and clinical plausibility.

Conclusion: DeepMedix-R1 advances medical FM development toward holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR interpretation by providing both answers and region-grounded reasoning steps.

Abstract: Medical foundation models (FMs) have shown tremendous promise amid the rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, current
medical FMs typically generate answers in a black-box manner, lacking
transparent reasoning processes and locally grounded interpretability, which
hinders their practical clinical deployments. To this end, we introduce
DeepMedix-R1, a holistic medical FM for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation. It
leverages a sequential training pipeline: initially fine-tuned on curated CXR
instruction data to equip with fundamental CXR interpretation capabilities,
then exposed to high-quality synthetic reasoning samples to enable cold-start
reasoning, and finally refined via online reinforcement learning to enhance
both grounded reasoning quality and generation performance. Thus, the model
produces both an answer and reasoning steps tied to the image's local regions
for each query. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates substantial improvements
in report generation (e.g., 14.54% and 31.32% over LLaVA-Rad and MedGemma) and
visual question answering (e.g., 57.75% and 23.06% over MedGemma and CheXagent)
tasks. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose Report Arena, a benchmarking
framework using advanced language models to evaluate answer quality, further
highlighting the superiority of DeepMedix-R1. Expert review of generated
reasoning steps reveals greater interpretability and clinical plausibility
compared to the established Qwen2.5-VL-7B model (0.7416 vs. 0.2584 overall
preference). Collectively, our work advances medical FM development toward
holistic, transparent, and clinically actionable modeling for CXR
interpretation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A novel best-first heuristic search algorithm that explicitly treats control parameters as decision points in automated planning, using delayed partial expansion to efficiently handle infinite decision spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat control parameters as embedded constraints rather than true decision points in the search space, limiting their effectiveness in planning problems with continuous numeric variables.

Method: Developed a best-first heuristic search algorithm with delayed partial expansion, where states are incrementally expanded by generating subsets of successors to handle infinite decision spaces defined by control parameters.

Result: The algorithm proves completeness under certain conditions and demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing approaches for planning problems with control parameters.

Conclusion: Explicitly treating control parameters as decision points within a systematic search scheme with delayed partial expansion provides an efficient and competitive alternative to constraint-based approaches in automated planning.

Abstract: In automated planning, control parameters extend standard action
representations through the introduction of continuous numeric decision
variables. Existing state-of-the-art approaches have primarily handled control
parameters as embedded constraints alongside other temporal and numeric
restrictions, and thus have implicitly treated them as additional constraints
rather than as decision points in the search space. In this paper, we propose
an efficient alternative that explicitly handles control parameters as true
decision points within a systematic search scheme. We develop a best-first,
heuristic search algorithm that operates over infinite decision spaces defined
by control parameters and prove a notion of completeness in the limit under
certain conditions. Our algorithm leverages the concept of delayed partial
expansion, where a state is not fully expanded but instead incrementally
expands a subset of its successors. Our results demonstrate that this novel
search algorithm is a competitive alternative to existing approaches for
solving planning problems involving control parameters.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable embodied agents to adapt to novel domains without extensive data collection or retraining, addressing the challenge of domain adaptation in AI systems.

Method: Prototype-based world model retrieval with trajectory-based abstract representation matching, plus world-wise compound attention to integrate knowledge and align representations.

Result: Superior zero-shot and few-shot performance on VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks compared to other LLM-based approaches across unseen domains.

Conclusion: WorMI demonstrates potential for scalable real-world deployment in embodied agent scenarios requiring adaptability and data efficiency.

Abstract: In embodied AI, a persistent challenge is enabling agents to robustly adapt
to novel domains without requiring extensive data collection or retraining. To
address this, we present a world model implanting framework (WorMI) that
combines the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with
independently learned, domain-specific world models through test-time
composition. By allowing seamless implantation and removal of the world models,
the embodied agent's policy achieves and maintains cross-domain adaptability.
In the WorMI framework, we employ a prototype-based world model retrieval
approach, utilizing efficient trajectory-based abstract representation
matching, to incorporate relevant models into test-time composition. We also
develop a world-wise compound attention method that not only integrates the
knowledge from the retrieved world models but also aligns their intermediate
representations with the reasoning model's representation within the agent's
policy. This framework design effectively fuses domain-specific knowledge from
multiple world models, ensuring robust adaptation to unseen domains. We
evaluate our WorMI on the VirtualHome and ALFWorld benchmarks, demonstrating
superior zero-shot and few-shot performance compared to several LLM-based
approaches across a range of unseen domains. These results highlight the
frameworks potential for scalable, real-world deployment in embodied agent
scenarios where adaptability and data efficiency are essential.

*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Meta-Policy Reflexion (MPR) is a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into reusable meta-policy memory, improving agent performance without weight updates through soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents often fail repeatedly, explore inefficiently, and lack cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies produce ephemeral traces, while RL alternatives require heavy computation and parameter updates.

Method: MPR creates structured Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) from LLM reflections, using soft memory-guided decoding and hard rule admissibility checks (HAC) to enforce constraints and improve decision-making at inference time.

Result: Empirical results show consistent gains in execution accuracy and robustness compared to Reflexion baselines, with rule admissibility further improving stability in text-based agent environments.

Conclusion: MPR successfully externalizes reusable corrective knowledge without model updates, enforces domain constraints, and retains language-based reflection adaptability, with potential for multimodal and multi-agent extensions.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance
but commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited
cross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,
ReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,
task-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning
based alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial
parameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion
(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a
structured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at
inference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding
and hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable
corrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain
constraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the
adaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,
present algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a
text-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in
the provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the
supplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and
robustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further
improves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss
scalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and

*Jinyuan Li,Yi Chu,Yiwen Sun,Mengchuan Zou,Shaowei Cai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoPBO is an LLM-powered framework that automatically enhances PBO local search solvers, showing significant improvements over previous local search approaches while maintaining competitive performance against state-of-the-art competitors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local search solvers for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization require significant expert effort and manual tuning, and while LLMs have shown potential in automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers remains unexplored.

Method: AutoPBO uses Large Language Models to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers through automated algorithm design and optimization.

Result: AutoPBO demonstrates significant improvements over previous local search approaches and maintains competitive performance compared to six state-of-the-art competitors across four public benchmarks.

Conclusion: AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating local search solver design for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization problems.

Abstract: Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) provides a powerful framework for modeling
combinatorial problems through pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints. Local search
solvers have shown excellent performance in PBO solving, and their efficiency
is highly dependent on their internal heuristics to guide the search. Still,
their design often requires significant expert effort and manual tuning in
practice. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
automating algorithm design, their application to optimizing PBO solvers
remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce AutoPBO, a novel LLM-powered
framework to automatically enhance PBO local search solvers. We conduct
experiments on a broad range of four public benchmarks, including one
real-world benchmark, a benchmark from PB competition, an integer linear
programming optimization benchmark, and a crafted combinatorial benchmark, to
evaluate the performance improvement achieved by AutoPBO and compare it with
six state-of-the-art competitors, including two local search PBO solvers NuPBO
and OraSLS, two complete PB solvers PBO-IHS and RoundingSat, and two mixed
integer programming (MIP) solvers Gurobi and SCIP. AutoPBO demonstrates
significant improvements over previous local search approaches, while
maintaining competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
The results suggest that AutoPBO offers a promising approach to automating
local search solver design.

*Zeyu Gan,Hao Yi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT-Space reframes LLM reasoning as continuous optimization in semantic space, explaining optimal Chain-of-Thought length through underfitting-overfitting trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional token-level RL frameworks don't align with reasoning-level nature of multi-step thought processes like Chain-of-Thought, creating a theoretical gap.

Method: Introduces CoT-Space framework that transforms LLM reasoning from discrete token-prediction to continuous optimization in reasoning-level semantic space, analyzed from noise and risk perspectives.

Result: Demonstrates convergence to optimal CoT length is natural consequence of underfitting-overfitting trade-off, with extensive experiments validating theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Provides coherent explanation for empirical phenomena like overthinking and offers solid theoretical foundation for developing more effective reasoning agents.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a pivotal approach for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, a significant
theoretical gap persists, as traditional token-level RL frameworks fail to
align with the reasoning-level nature of complex, multi-step thought processes
like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To address this challenge, we introduce CoT-Space,
a novel theoretical framework that recasts LLM reasoning from a discrete
token-prediction task to an optimization process within a continuous,
reasoning-level semantic space. By analyzing this process from both a noise
perspective and a risk perspective, we demonstrate that the convergence to an
optimal CoT length is a natural consequence of the fundamental trade-off
between underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, extensive experiments
provide strong empirical validation for our theoretical findings. Our framework
not only provides a coherent explanation for empirical phenomena such as
overthinking but also offers a solid theoretical foundation to guide the future
development of more effective and generalizable reasoning agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Oruga is an implementation of Representational Systems Theory that enables flexible representation transformations through structure transfer, aiming to make machines more compatible with human cognitive processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness human-like flexible representation capabilities (drawing diagrams, changing representations, creative analogies) and endow machines with similar abilities to improve human-machine compatibility.

Method: Developed Oruga system with core data structures based on RST concepts, a communication language, and an engine using structure transfer method for producing representation transformations.

Result: Created a functional implementation (Oruga) that demonstrates representation transformations through structure transfer, though specific performance metrics are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Oruga successfully implements key aspects of Representational Systems Theory and provides a foundation for enabling machines to perform flexible representation transformations similar to human cognitive processes.

Abstract: Humans use representations flexibly. We draw diagrams, change representations
and exploit creative analogies across different domains. We want to harness
this kind of power and endow machines with it to make them more compatible with
human use. Previously we developed Representational Systems Theory (RST) to
study the structure and transformations of representations. In this paper we
present Oruga (caterpillar in Spanish; a symbol of transformation), an
implementation of various aspects of RST. Oruga consists of a core of data
structures corresponding to concepts in RST, a language for communicating with
the core, and an engine for producing transformations using a method we call
structure transfer. In this paper we present an overview of the core and
language of Oruga, with a brief example of the kind of transformation that
structure transfer can execute.

*Alexander Beiser,David Penz,Nysret Musliu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The choice of formal language significantly impacts neurosymbolic LLM reasoning performance, affecting both syntactic and semantic capabilities across different models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While neurosymbolic LLM reasoning shows promise by combining LLMs as translators with symbolic solvers, the factors contributing to its success remain unclear, particularly the overlooked role of formal language selection.

Method: The study compares four formal languages across three datasets and seven different large language models to evaluate how formal language choice affects reasoning capabilities.

Result: The research demonstrates that the choice of formal language has substantial effects on both syntactic and semantic reasoning performance, with varying impacts observed across different LLMs.

Conclusion: The intermediate language challenge - selecting appropriate formal languages - is a critical factor in neurosymbolic reasoning that significantly influences LLM performance and should be carefully considered in future research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of
tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising
approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators
from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct
results. Still, the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM
reasoning remain unclear. This paper demonstrates that one previously
overlooked factor is the choice of the formal language. We introduce the
intermediate language challenge: selecting a suitable formal language for
neurosymbolic reasoning. By comparing four formal languages across three
datasets and seven LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects
both syntactic and semantic reasoning capabilities. We also discuss the varying
effects across different LLMs.

### [100] [Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Search for Flight Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04100)
*Alberto Luise,Michele Lombardi,Florent Teichteil Koenigsbuch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-guided path planning speeds up emergency flight route optimization by 50% while maintaining fuel efficiency within 1% of optimal solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emergency situations require fast route re-calculation for airliners, where conventional solvers may be too slow for time-critical decisions.

Method: Train RL agent to pre-compute near-optimal paths using location and atmospheric data, then use these as constraints to reduce search space for conventional path planning solver.

Result: Empirical tests with Airbus performance models show fuel consumption deviations within 1% of unconstrained solver, with computation speed improvements up to 50%.

Conclusion: Combining RL with traditional solvers provides significant speed benefits for emergency flight path optimization while maintaining near-optimal fuel efficiency.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and
search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for
airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be
crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute
near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at
runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution
within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively
reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route
optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results
conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption
remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations
typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up
to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.

### [101] [Analysis of Bluffing by DQN and CFR in Leduc Hold'em Poker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04125)
*Tarik Zaciragic,Aske Plaat,K. Joost Batenburg*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DQN and CFR algorithms both exhibit bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em poker, with similar success rates despite different bluffing frequencies, suggesting bluffing is essential to the game rather than algorithm-specific.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most computer poker research focuses on win rates while overlooking bluffing behavior, which is an essential human poker skill that needs to be studied in AI algorithms.

Method: Designed an experiment where DQN (reinforcement learning) and CFR (game theory) agents played against each other in Leduc Hold'em while logging their actions to analyze bluffing behavior.

Result: Both DQN and CFR exhibited bluffing behavior but in different ways - they attempted bluffs at different rates, yet achieved roughly the same percentage of successful bluffs where the opponent folded.

Conclusion: Bluffing is an essential aspect of poker itself rather than being algorithm-specific, and future work should explore different bluffing styles and full poker games.

Abstract: In the game of poker, being unpredictable, or bluffing, is an essential
skill. When humans play poker, they bluff. However, most works on
computer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing
is overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN
(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit
bluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed
an experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while
we log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,
but they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at
different rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)
is roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the
game, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing
styles and at the full game of poker. Code at

*William Stewart*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI may surpass human capabilities but cannot match human emotional understanding through the central nervous system, making biological beings better suited for universal leadership.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI systems achieving AGI could become superior to humans and assume leadership, and to identify what fundamentally differentiates humans from AI.

Method: Philosophical analysis comparing human biological systems (particularly the CNS) with artificial intelligence capabilities, focusing on emotional experience and ethical development.

Result: The central nervous system enables humans to experience emotions and fully appreciate consequences of actions, which is essential for developing sustainable ethical systems - something AI cannot replicate through simulation.

Conclusion: While AI may exceed human capabilities in many areas, biological beings with grown CNS will always be better qualified for leadership due to their emotional understanding and ethical development capacity.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor "digital species", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.

### [104] [Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04192)
*Vera Koponen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analysis of Markov logic networks' asymptotic behavior as domain size increases, focusing on three specific cases: quantifier-free MLNs with unary relations, triangle/clique-minimizing MLNs, and degree-constrained MLNs, showing varied limit behaviors and incomparability with lifted Bayesian networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how probability distributions defined by Markov logic networks behave as the domain size approaches infinity, and to characterize the limit behaviors of random structures under different types of soft constraints.

Method: Theoretical analysis of three concrete MLN examples: (1) quantifier-free MLNs with single unary relation, (2) MLNs favoring graphs with fewer triangles/k-cliques, (3) MLNs favoring graphs with fewer high-degree vertices. Examines asymptotic properties and compares with lifted Bayesian networks.

Result: Different MLN types exhibit distinct limit behaviors - weights may or may not influence asymptotic properties. Quantifier-free MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks are asymptotically incomparable. MLN distributions concentrate probability mass differently than uniform distributions on large domains.

Conclusion: The choice of soft constraints in MLNs significantly impacts asymptotic behavior, with varying influence from constraint weights. MLNs and lifted Bayesian networks capture different asymptotic distributions, demonstrating the unique capabilities of each formalism for large-domain probabilistic modeling.

Abstract: A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoEmo is an evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional expression in LLM negotiations, outperforming baseline strategies with higher success rates and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents overlook the functional role of emotions in negotiations, generating passive emotional responses that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by adversarial counterparts.

Method: EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments show EvoEmo consistently outperforms both vanilla strategies and fixed-emotion strategies, achieving higher success rates, higher efficiency, and increased buyer savings.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for multi-turn negotiation.

Abstract: Recent research on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models
(LLMs) has demonstrated that agents can engage in \textit{complex},
\textit{multi-turn} negotiations, opening new avenues for agentic AI. However,
existing LLM agents largely overlook the functional role of emotions in such
negotiations, instead generating passive, preference-driven emotional responses
that make them vulnerable to manipulation and strategic exploitation by
adversarial counterparts. To address this gap, we present EvoEmo, an
evolutionary reinforcement learning framework that optimizes dynamic emotional
expression in negotiations. EvoEmo models emotional state transitions as a
Markov Decision Process and employs population-based genetic optimization to
evolve high-reward emotion policies across diverse negotiation scenarios. We
further propose an evaluation framework with two baselines -- vanilla
strategies and fixed-emotion strategies -- for benchmarking emotion-aware
negotiation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show that EvoEmo
consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving higher success rates, higher
efficiency, and increased buyer savings. This findings highlight the importance
of adaptive emotional expression in enabling more effective LLM agents for
multi-turn negotiation.

*Isidoro Tamassia,Wendelin Böhmer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaZero framework adaptation for changed test environments with simple modifications to boost performance under low planning budget


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaZero assumes static environments from training to test, limiting real-world applicability where environments may change

Method: Combination of simple modifications to standard AlphaZero framework to handle environment changes

Result: Significant performance improvement even with low planning budget available

Conclusion: Modified AlphaZero framework enables effective deployment in changed test environments with practical planning constraints

Abstract: The AlphaZero framework provides a standard way of combining Monte Carlo
planning with prior knowledge provided by a previously trained policy-value
neural network. AlphaZero usually assumes that the environment on which the
neural network was trained will not change at test time, which constrains its
applicability. In this paper, we analyze the problem of deploying AlphaZero
agents in potentially changed test environments and demonstrate how the
combination of simple modifications to the standard framework can significantly
boost performance, even in settings with a low planning budget available. The
code is publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: MBTI-in-Thoughts framework uses MBTI personality conditioning via prompt engineering to enhance LLM agent behavior without fine-tuning, showing consistent personality-driven performance across tasks and enabling structured multi-agent communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge psychological theory with LLM behavior design by creating psychologically grounded AI agents that exhibit consistent, interpretable personality traits for enhanced performance in various tasks.

Method: Priming LLM agents with distinct MBTI personality archetypes through prompt engineering, controlling behavior along cognition and affect axes, and integrating the official 16Personalities test for automated trait verification.

Result: Personality priming yields consistent behavioral biases: emotionally expressive agents excel in narrative generation, analytically primed agents adopt stable strategies in game theory, and self-reflection improves cooperation and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: The framework successfully establishes psychologically enhanced AI agents without fine-tuning, generalizes to other psychological frameworks (Big Five, HEXACO, Enneagram), and provides foundation for personality-driven LLM behavior control.

Abstract: We introduce MBTI-in-Thoughts, a framework for enhancing the effectiveness of
Large Language Model (LLM) agents through psychologically grounded personality
conditioning. Drawing on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), our method
primes agents with distinct personality archetypes via prompt engineering,
enabling control over behavior along two foundational axes of human psychology,
cognition and affect. We show that such personality priming yields consistent,
interpretable behavioral biases across diverse tasks: emotionally expressive
agents excel in narrative generation, while analytically primed agents adopt
more stable strategies in game-theoretic settings. Our framework supports
experimenting with structured multi-agent communication protocols and reveals
that self-reflection prior to interaction improves cooperation and reasoning
quality. To ensure trait persistence, we integrate the official 16Personalities
test for automated verification. While our focus is on MBTI, we show that our
approach generalizes seamlessly to other psychological frameworks such as Big
Five, HEXACO, or Enneagram. By bridging psychological theory and LLM behavior
design, we establish a foundation for psychologically enhanced AI agents
without any fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces concept-level memory for LLMs that distills reusable abstractions from reasoning traces, enabling test-time continual learning without weight updates and achieving 7.5% improvement on ARC-AGI benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs discard valuable patterns and insights from reasoning traces once context windows reset. External memory could persist these discoveries, but existing approaches use instance-based entries that lack reusability and scalability.

Method: Proposes concept-level memory with strategies for abstracting takeaways from solution rollouts and retrieving relevant concepts for new queries. Uses natural language storage of modular abstractions that can be selectively integrated into prompts.

Result: Achieves 7.5% relative gain over strong no-memory baseline on ARC-AGI benchmark, with performance scaling with inference compute. Abstract concepts outperform other memory designs at all compute scales. Dynamic memory updating during test-time beats fixed memory with additional attempts.

Conclusion: Concept-level memory enables effective test-time continual learning through reusable abstractions, supporting self-improvement as solving more problems allows abstracting more patterns to memory, which in turn enables further solutions.

Abstract: While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and
capable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these
traces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new
query. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and
recent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an
opportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving
beyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or
summaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward
concept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution
traces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts
are selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time
continual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies
for abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,
promoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On
the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over
a strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference
compute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,
outscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales. Moreover, we
confirm that dynamically updating memory during test-time outperforms an
otherwise identical fixed memory setting with additional attempts, supporting
the hypothesis that solving more problems and abstracting more patterns to
memory enables further solutions in a form of self-improvement. Code available

Motivation: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer's and related dementias remain undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.

Method: Evaluated nine text-only and three multimodal audio-text models on DementiaBank speech corpus using various adaptation strategies including in-context learning, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and multimodal integration.

Result: Class-centroid demonstrations achieved highest in-context learning performance, reasoning improved smaller models, token-level fine-tuning produced best scores. Multimodal models performed well but didn't surpass top text-only models.

Abstract: Over half of US adults with Alzheimer disease and related dementias remain
undiagnosed, and speech-based screening offers a scalable detection approach.
We compared large language model adaptation strategies for dementia detection
using the DementiaBank speech corpus, evaluating nine text-only models and
three multimodal audio-text models on recordings from DementiaBank speech
corpus. Adaptations included in-context learning with different demonstration
selection policies, reasoning-augmented prompting, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, and multimodal integration. Results showed that class-centroid
demonstrations achieved the highest in-context learning performance, reasoning
improved smaller models, and token-level fine-tuning generally produced the
best scores. Adding a classification head substantially improved
underperforming models. Among multimodal models, fine-tuned audio-text systems
performed well but did not surpass the top text-only models. These findings
highlight that model adaptation strategies, including demonstration selection,
reasoning design, and tuning method, critically influence speech-based dementia
detection, and that properly adapted open-weight models can match or exceed
commercial systems.

### [111] [Enhancing Speech Large Language Models through Reinforced Behavior Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03526)
*Yansong Liu,Jiateng Li,Yuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA) framework enhances speech-based LLMs' instruction-following capabilities using self-synthesized data and reinforcement learning, outperforming conventional methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance on various speech tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech-based LLMs (SpeechLMs) suffer from performance gaps compared to text-based LLMs due to inter-modal discrepancies, especially when handling dynamic and variable user speech inputs.

Method: RBA employs self-synthesis methodology using a powerful teacher LLM to generate high-fidelity alignment data, then aligns SpeechLMs behavior through reinforcement learning instead of supervised fine-tuning.

Result: The method effectively enhances instruction-following capabilities, outperforms conventional distillation baselines, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation tasks using only self-generated data.

Conclusion: RBA provides a scalable framework for improving SpeechLMs' performance without human annotations, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple speech processing tasks.

Abstract: The recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred
considerable research interest in extending their linguistic capabilities
beyond text to other modalities, which leads to emergence of speech-based LLMs
(SpeechLMs) with capability of processing user request in either speech or
textual formats. However, owing to inter-modal discrepancies, these SpeechLMs
still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to their text-based LLM
counterparts in instruction-following, particularly when confronted with the
dynamic and variable nature of user speech. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces a framework termed Reinforced Behavior Alignment (RBA),
designed to bolster the language generation proficiency of SpeechLMs. Instead
of relying on supervised fine-tuning from human annotations, RBA employs a
self-synthesis methodology to generate extensive, high-fidelity alignment data
by a powerful teacher LLM. Then SpeechLMs is aligned its behavior with that of
a teacher using a reinforcement learning-based approach. Experimental results
demonstrate that this method effectively enhances the instruction-following
capabilities of SpeechLMs that outperform conventional distillation baselines.
Crucially, we demonstrate that RBA can be seamlessly extended to tasks such
including spoken question answering and speech-to-text translation, attaining
state-of-the-art performance on open benchmarks with only self-generated data.

*Bohdan M. Pavlyshenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM with RAG performs multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis, generating graph/text summaries with sentiment scores and JSON representations to eliminate hallucinations and provide comprehensive insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cryptocurrency news analysis challenges, particularly large language model hallucinations, by providing complementary graph and text-based views through hierarchical analysis.

Method: Uses fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM with 4-bit quantization via PEFT/LoRA approach and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for multilevel analysis: level 1 generates graph/text summaries with sentiment scores and JSON representations, higher levels perform hierarchical stacking of summaries.

Result: Demonstrates that the approach can conduct informative qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights while eliminating hallucination problems through knowledge graph representation.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM with RAG is effective for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis, offering complementary graph-text views and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

Abstract: In the paper, we consider multilevel multitask analysis of cryptocurrency
news using a fine-tuned Mistral 7B large language model with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  On the first level of analytics, the fine-tuned model generates graph and
text summaries with sentiment scores as well as JSON representations of
summaries. Higher levels perform hierarchical stacking that consolidates sets
of graph-based and text-based summaries as well as summaries of summaries into
comprehensive reports. The combination of graph and text summaries provides
complementary views of cryptocurrency news. The model is fine-tuned with 4-bit
quantization using the PEFT/LoRA approach. The representation of cryptocurrency
news as knowledge graph can essentially eliminate problems with large language
model hallucinations.
  The obtained results demonstrate that the use of fine-tuned Mistral 7B LLM
models for multilevel cryptocurrency news analysis can conduct informative
qualitative and quantitative analytics, providing important insights.

*Matilde Contestabile,Chiara Ferrara,Alberto Giovannetti,Giovanni Parrillo,Andrea Vandin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProLiFIC is a comprehensive event log of Italian lawmaking process (1987-2022) created using LLMs from unstructured data, serving as a benchmark for legal process mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process mining's application in legal systems is limited by dataset accessibility and quality. There's a need for comprehensive legal event logs to enable effective process mining in the legal domain.

Method: Created ProLiFIC from unstructured data from Normattiva portal using large language models (LLMs) to structure the data into a comprehensive event log of Italian lawmaking process.

Result: Developed a comprehensive event log covering Italian lawmaking from 1987-2022, demonstrating preliminary analyses and positioning it as a benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: ProLiFIC serves as a valuable benchmark for legal process mining, fostering new developments by integrating process mining with LLMs for legal system analysis.

Abstract: Process Mining (PM), initially developed for industrial and business
contexts, has recently been applied to social systems, including legal ones.
However, PM's efficacy in the legal domain is limited by the accessibility and
quality of datasets. We introduce ProLiFIC (Procedural Lawmaking Flow in
Italian Chambers), a comprehensive event log of the Italian lawmaking process
from 1987 to 2022. Created from unstructured data from the Normattiva portal
and structured using large language models (LLMs), ProLiFIC aligns with recent
efforts in integrating PM with LLMs. We exemplify preliminary analyses and
propose ProLiFIC as a benchmark for legal PM, fostering new developments.

*Alejandro Álvarez Castro,Joaquín Ordieres-Meré*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel multi-modal framework for earnings calls using hierarchical discourse trees with text, audio, and video emotional signals, achieving semantically rich embeddings for financial forecasting and other high-stakes communication domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing financial sentiment analysis systems fail to capture the layered discourse structure of earnings calls, which blend scripted managerial commentary with unscripted analyst dialogue in a semi-structured format.

Method: Two-stage transformer architecture: first encodes multi-modal content and discourse metadata at node level using contrastive learning, second synthesizes global embedding for entire conference. Nodes represent monologues or question-answer pairs enriched with emotional signals and structured metadata.

Result: Embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic alignment. The system generalizes to other high-stakes unscripted communicative domains.

Conclusion: The framework offers practical utility for financial forecasting and discourse evaluation while providing a generalizable method applicable to tele-medicine, education, and political discourse domains.

Abstract: Earnings calls represent a uniquely rich and semi-structured source of
financial communication, blending scripted managerial commentary with
unscripted analyst dialogue. Although recent advances in financial sentiment
analysis have integrated multi-modal signals, such as textual content and vocal
tone, most systems rely on flat document-level or sentence-level models,
failing to capture the layered discourse structure of these interactions. This
paper introduces a novel multi-modal framework designed to generate
semantically rich and structurally aware embeddings of earnings calls, by
encoding them as hierarchical discourse trees. Each node, comprising either a
monologue or a question-answer pair, is enriched with emotional signals derived
from text, audio, and video, as well as structured metadata including coherence
scores, topic labels, and answer coverage assessments. A two-stage transformer
architecture is proposed: the first encodes multi-modal content and discourse
metadata at the node level using contrastive learning, while the second
synthesizes a global embedding for the entire conference. Experimental results
reveal that the resulting embeddings form stable, semantically meaningful
representations that reflect affective tone, structural logic, and thematic
alignment. Beyond financial reporting, the proposed system generalizes to other
high-stakes unscripted communicative domains such as tele-medicine, education,
and political discourse, offering a robust and explainable approach to
multi-modal discourse representation. This approach offers practical utility
for downstream tasks such as financial forecasting and discourse evaluation,
while also providing a generalizable method applicable to other domains
involving high-stakes communication.

*Paul Blum,Enrico Liscio,Ruixuan Zhang,Caroline Figueroa,Pradeep K. Murukannaiah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Early-SIB: Transformer model predicts adolescent suicidal ideation from forum posts before explicit disclosure, achieving 0.73 balanced accuracy on Dutch youth forum data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a leading cause of adolescent death, but many cases go undetected due to lack of mental health contact. Social media provides real-time insights into youth struggles that could enable early detection.

Method: Transformer-based model that sequentially processes both posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will eventually write a suicidal ideation/behavior (SIB) post, without using any self-disclosure as input.

Result: Achieved 0.73 balanced accuracy for predicting future SIB on a Dutch youth forum dataset.

Conclusion: Social media-based predictive tools like Early-SIB can meaningfully supplement traditional suicide prevention methods by detecting risk before explicit disclosure.

Abstract: Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (12-18), yet predicting
it remains a significant challenge. Many cases go undetected due to a lack of
contact with mental health services. Social media, however, offers a unique
opportunity, as young people often share their thoughts and struggles online in
real time. In this work, we propose a novel task and method to approach it:
predicting suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) from forum posts before an
adolescent explicitly expresses suicidal ideation on an online forum. This
predictive framing, where no self-disclosure is used as input at any stage,
remains largely unexplored in the suicide prediction literature. To this end,
we introduce Early-SIB, a transformer-based model that sequentially processes
the posts a user writes and engages with to predict whether they will write a
SIB post. Our model achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.73 for predicting future
SIB on a Dutch youth forum, demonstrating that such tools can offer a
meaningful addition to traditional methods.

*Oscar Obeso,Andy Arditi,Javier Ferrando,Joshua Freeman,Cameron Holmes,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable method for real-time detection of entity-level hallucinations in long-form LLM generations using web-search-annotated datasets and linear probes, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language models can cause serious harm in high-stakes applications like medical and legal domains, but existing detection methods are impractical for real-world use due to limitations with long-form content and high verification costs.

Method: Developed an annotation methodology using web search to label model responses, identifying which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. Used this dataset to train efficient hallucination classifiers with linear probes that can detect entity-level hallucinations in real-time.

Result: Classifiers consistently outperformed baselines across four model families, achieving AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for Llama-3.3-70B on long-form responses. Also showed improvement in short-form QA and generalized to mathematical reasoning tasks despite being trained only on entity-level labels.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising scalable solution for real-world hallucination detection, with publicly released datasets enabling reuse across different models while maintaining effectiveness.

Abstract: Large language models are now routinely used in high-stakes applications
where hallucinations can cause serious harm, such as medical consultations or
legal advice. Existing hallucination detection methods, however, are
impractical for real-world use, as they are either limited to short factual
queries or require costly external verification. We present a cheap, scalable
method for real-time identification of hallucinated tokens in long-form
generations, and scale it effectively to 70B parameter models. Our approach
targets \emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,
citations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level
labels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology
that leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels
indicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables
us to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient
methods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our
classifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including
more expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for
Llama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering
settings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our
probes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,
indicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is
expensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train
effective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our
datasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new
approach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection.

*Igor Halperin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes UDIB method for detecting LLM confabulations using information-theoretic topic clustering instead of geometric clustering


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current semantic divergence metrics rely on geometric clustering optimized for spatial proximity rather than information-theoretic analysis, creating a disconnect in detecting LLM hallucinations

Method: Develops UDIB (upper bound Deterministic Information Bottleneck) method that replaces intractable KL divergence with efficient upper bound, creating entropy-regularized robust K-means that favors informative clusters

Result: UDIB generates shared topic representations that are maximally informative about prompt-response relationships, providing superior foundation for semantic divergence metrics

Conclusion: UDIB offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting LLM confabulations by bridging the gap between geometric clustering and information-theoretic analysis

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to critical failure modes, including
\textit{intrinsic faithfulness hallucinations} (also known as confabulations),
where a response deviates semantically from the provided context. Frameworks
designed to detect this, such as Semantic Divergence Metrics (SDM), rely on
identifying latent topics shared between prompts and responses, typically by
applying geometric clustering to their sentence embeddings. This creates a
disconnect, as the topics are optimized for spatial proximity, not for the
downstream information-theoretic analysis. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
developing a principled topic identification method grounded in the
Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) for geometric clustering. Our key
contribution is to transform the DIB method into a practical algorithm for
high-dimensional data by substituting its intractable KL divergence term with a
computationally efficient upper bound. The resulting method, which we dub UDIB,
can be interpreted as an entropy-regularized and robustified version of K-means
that inherently favors a parsimonious number of informative clusters. By
applying UDIB to the joint clustering of LLM prompt and response embeddings, we
generate a shared topic representation that is not merely spatially coherent
but is fundamentally structured to be maximally informative about the
prompt-response relationship. This provides a superior foundation for the SDM
framework and offers a novel, more sensitive tool for detecting confabulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of practice materials tailored to abundant educational resources available to learners in the information-rich era

Method: Four-component system: multi-modal input handling, question generation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and end-to-end interactive interface

Result: Developed foundation for automated, scalable, and intelligent question generation

Conclusion: The system successfully bridges the gap in educational practice materials by providing tailored questions while balancing resource efficiency, robust functionality, and user experience

Abstract: In today's information-rich era, learners have access to abundant educational

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AR^2 framework uses adversarial reinforcement learning to enhance LLM abstraction skills by training models to extract computational kernels from complex narrative problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM training approaches focus on superficial pattern recognition but lack explicit training for abstraction skills, which are critical for solving complex programming problems.

Method: Uses a teacher model to transform kernel problems into narrative-rich descriptions while maintaining fundamental logic, and trains a student coding model to extract and solve the underlying computational kernels.

Result: AR^2 significantly improves student model accuracy on previously unseen, challenging programming tasks.

Conclusion: Abstraction is a key skill for enhancing LLM generalization capabilities in code generation.

Abstract: Abstraction--the ability to recognize and distill essential computational
patterns from complex problem statements--is a foundational skill in computer
science, critical both for human problem-solvers and coding-oriented large
language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in training LLMs for code
generation using reinforcement learning (RL), most existing approaches focus
primarily on superficial pattern recognition, overlooking explicit training for
abstraction. In this study, we propose AR$^2$ (Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning for Abstract Reasoning), a novel framework explicitly designed to
enhance the abstraction abilities of LLMs. AR$^2$ employs a teacher model to
transform kernel problems into narrative-rich, challenging descriptions without
changing their fundamental logic. Simultaneously, a student coding model is
trained to solve these complex narrative problems by extracting their
underlying computational kernels. Experimental results demonstrate that AR$^2$
substantially improves the student model's accuracy on previously unseen,
challenging programming tasks, underscoring abstraction as a key skill for
enhancing LLM generalization.

*Shanglin Wu,Lihui Liu,Jinho D. Choi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel framework that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs during inference to improve LLM factuality by integrating internal knowledge from LLMs and external information from retrieval sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with factual consistency due to parametric memory limitations, and existing RAG methods treat knowledge as unstructured text, limiting compositional reasoning and factual inconsistency detection.

Method: Extracts seed KG from questions via prompting, iteratively expands using LLM's latent knowledge, and selectively refines through external retrieval to enhance factual coverage and correct inaccuracies.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods on three factual QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Inference-time KG construction is a promising direction for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable manner.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with producing factually
consistent answers due to limitations in their parametric memory.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods address this issue by
incorporating external knowledge from trusted sources at inference time.
However, such methods typically treat knowledge as unstructured text, which
limits their ability to support compositional reasoning and identify factual
inconsistencies. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework
that dynamically constructs and expands knowledge graphs (KGs) during
inference, integrating both internal knowledge extracted from LLMs and external
information retrieved from external sources. Our method begins by extracting a
seed KG from the question via prompting, followed by iterative expansion using
the LLM's latent knowledge. The graph is then selectively refined through
external retrieval, enhancing factual coverage and correcting inaccuracies. We
evaluate our approach on three diverse factual QA benchmarks, demonstrating
consistent improvements in factual accuracy, answer precision, and
interpretability over baseline prompting and static KG-augmented methods. Our
findings suggest that inference-time KG construction is a promising direction
for enhancing LLM factuality in a structured, interpretable, and scalable
manner.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment, structural consistency, and visual fidelity despite using 7B-scale agents.

Conclusion: ResearchPulse successfully formalizes multi-document scientific inference and provides a citation-aware benchmark for evaluating research development chain reconstruction.

Abstract: Understanding how scientific ideas evolve requires more than summarizing
individual papers-it demands structured, cross-document reasoning over
thematically related research. In this work, we formalize multi-document
scientific inference, a new task that extracts and aligns motivation,
methodology, and experimental results across related papers to reconstruct
research development chains. This task introduces key challenges, including
temporally aligning loosely structured methods and standardizing heterogeneous
experimental tables. We present ResearchPulse, an agent-based framework that
integrates instruction planning, scientific content extraction, and structured
visualization. It consists of three coordinated agents: a Plan Agent for task
decomposition, a Mmap-Agent that constructs motivation-method mind maps, and a
Lchart-Agent that synthesizes experimental line charts. To support this task,
we introduce ResearchPulse-Bench, a citation-aware benchmark of annotated paper
clusters. Experiments show that our system, despite using 7B-scale agents,
consistently outperforms strong baselines like GPT-4o in semantic alignment,
structural consistency, and visual fidelity. The dataset are available in

TL;DR: Sprinklr-Edge-OCR outperforms LVLMs in edge deployment, achieving best F1 score (0.46) and 35x faster processing at 0.01x cost, showing traditional OCR systems remain optimal for resource-constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of multilingual OCR in noisy real-world images and evaluate whether LVLMs can outperform traditional OCR systems in edge deployment scenarios with limited resources.

Method: Comparative evaluation of 5 LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and 2 traditional OCR systems on a proprietary multilingual dataset (54 languages) with metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency, efficiency, and deployment cost analysis.

Result: Qwen achieved highest precision (0.54), Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered best F1 score (0.46) and superior efficiency (0.17s per image, 35x faster than LVLMs) at minimal cost (0.006 USD per 1,000 images).

Conclusion: Traditional OCR systems like Sprinklr-Edge-OCR are more optimal for edge deployment than LVLMs due to significantly lower compute requirements, lower latency, and much higher affordability despite the rise of large language models.

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in multilingual, noisy, and diverse
real-world images remains a significant challenge for optical character
recognition systems. With the rise of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs),
there is growing interest in their ability to generalize and reason beyond
fixed OCR pipelines. In this work, we introduce Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, a novel OCR
system built specifically optimized for edge deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We present a large-scale comparative evaluation of five
state-of-the-art LVLMs (InternVL, Qwen, GOT OCR, LLaMA, MiniCPM) and two
traditional OCR systems (Sprinklr-Edge-OCR, SuryaOCR) on a proprietary, doubly
hand annotated dataset of multilingual (54 languages) images. Our benchmark
covers a broad range of metrics including accuracy, semantic consistency,
language coverage, computational efficiency (latency, memory, GPU usage), and
deployment cost. To better reflect real-world applicability, we also conducted
edge case deployment analysis, evaluating model performance on CPU only
environments. Among the results, Qwen achieved the highest precision (0.54),
while Sprinklr-Edge-OCR delivered the best overall F1 score (0.46) and
outperformed others in efficiency, processing images 35 faster (0.17 seconds
per image on average) and at less than 0.01 of the cost (0.006 USD per 1,000
images) compared to LVLM. Our findings demonstrate that the most optimal OCR
systems for edge deployment are the traditional ones even in the era of LLMs
due to their low compute requirements, low latency, and very high
affordability.

TL;DR: Lightweight steering vectors can reduce LLM self-preference bias by up to 97% without retraining, but show instability on legitimate cases, highlighting both promise and limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from self-preference bias where they favor their own outputs over others, undermining fairness in evaluation pipelines for tasks like preference tuning and model routing.

Method: Created curated dataset distinguishing justified vs unjustified self-preference, then constructed steering vectors using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and optimization-based approach to mitigate bias at inference time.

Result: Steering vectors reduced unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97%, substantially outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines.

Conclusion: While effective for reducing bias, steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased agreement, indicating self-preference spans multiple nonlinear directions, motivating more robust interventions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as automated evaluators, yet
they suffer from "self-preference bias": a tendency to favor their own outputs
over those of other models. This bias undermines fairness and reliability in
evaluation pipelines, particularly for tasks like preference tuning and model
routing. We investigate whether lightweight steering vectors can mitigate this
problem at inference time without retraining. We introduce a curated dataset
that distinguishes self-preference bias into justified examples of
self-preference and unjustified examples of self-preference, and we construct
steering vectors using two methods: Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) and
an optimization-based approach. Our results show that steering vectors can
reduce unjustified self-preference bias by up to 97\%, substantially
outperforming prompting and direct preference optimization baselines. Yet
steering vectors are unstable on legitimate self-preference and unbiased
agreement, implying self-preference spans multiple or nonlinear directions.
This underscores both their promise and limits as safeguards for LLM-as-judges
and motivates more robust interventions.

TL;DR: Study examines relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic similarity using MIMIC-IV data, finding weak correlation but complementary value for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical notes contain rich narratives but are unstructured, making large-scale analysis challenging. Understanding how standardized concepts relate through co-occurrence and semantic similarity is underexplored.

Method: Used MIMIC-IV database, Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI), and pretrained embeddings (ClinicalBERT, BioBERT) to analyze concept relationships, temporal evolution, and cross-specialty patterns.

Result: Co-occurrence and semantic similarity weakly correlated; embeddings captured clinically meaningful associations not reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding suggestions matched later-documented concepts. Clustering revealed coherent clinical themes linked to patient phenotypes.

Conclusion: Co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings provide complementary value for improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical relationships, and supporting decision-making and phenotyping applications.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format
poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as
SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate
through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this
study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship
between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic
similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained
embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently
co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can
suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and
across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic
similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful
associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based
suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their
utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings
yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular
conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally,
co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission
demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings
highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic
embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical
relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications.

targets, enhancing domain adaptation. By constructing a discriminative
embedding space, MLSD allows a cross-target or cross-domain stance detection
model to acquire useful examples from new target domains. We evaluate MLSD in
multiple cross-target and cross-domain scenarios across two datasets, showing
statistically significant improvement in stance detection performance across
six widely used stance detection models.

### [127] [SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03791)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SiLVERScore is a novel embedding-based metric that directly evaluates sign language generation by assessing semantic similarity in a joint embedding space, overcoming limitations of back-translation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional back-translation evaluation for sign language generation introduces ambiguity and fails to capture multimodal aspects like facial expressions and prosody, making it hard to identify whether errors come from generation or translation systems.

Method: Proposed SiLVERScore, a semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space without requiring back-translation.

Result: Achieved near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC = 0.99, overlap < 7%) on PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

Conclusion: SiLVERScore provides a robust, semantically-aware evaluation framework that better captures the multimodal nature of sign language and eliminates the ambiguity of traditional two-step evaluation pipelines.

Abstract: Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,
where generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a
reference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline
introduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of
sign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also
makes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation
model or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose
SiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that
assesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions
include: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing
SiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness
to semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization
challenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore
achieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC
= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.

### [128] [Measuring How (Not Just Whether) VLMs Build Common Ground](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03805)
*Saki Imai,Mert İnan,Anthony Sicilia,Malihe Alikhani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs claim reasoning but current benchmarks don't test interactive grounding. New 4-metric suite evaluates VLM performance in interactive referential games, showing models diverge from human patterns despite task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks evaluate VLMs in single-turn or QA settings, but grounding is an interactive process where people develop shared understanding through ongoing communication.

Method: Introduced a four-metric suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, human-likeness) and deployed it on 150 self-play sessions of interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs, comparing with human dyads.

Result: All three models diverged from human patterns on at least three metrics (GPT4o-mini was closest overall). Task success scores don't indicate successful grounding, and high image-utterance alignment doesn't necessarily predict task success.

Conclusion: The metric suite and findings provide a framework for future research on VLM grounding, highlighting the need for better evaluation of interactive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) increasingly claim reasoning skills, yet
current benchmarks evaluate them in single-turn or question answering settings.
However, grounding is an interactive process in which people gradually develop
shared understanding through ongoing communication. We introduce a four-metric
suite (grounding efficiency, content alignment, lexical adaptation, and
human-likeness) to systematically evaluate VLM performance in interactive
grounding contexts. We deploy the suite on 150 self-play sessions of
interactive referential games between three proprietary VLMs and compare them
with human dyads. All three models diverge from human patterns on at least
three metrics, while GPT4o-mini is the closest overall. We find that (i) task
success scores do not indicate successful grounding and (ii) high
image-utterance alignment does not necessarily predict task success. Our metric
suite and findings offer a framework for future research on VLM grounding.

*Jiaxin Guo,Daimeng Wei,Yuanchang Luo,Xiaoyu Chen,Zhanglin Wu,Huan Yang,Hengchao Shang,Zongyao Li,Zhiqiang Rao,Jinlong Yang,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Align-then-Slide framework for evaluating document-level machine translation by aligning sentences and using sliding window evaluation with multiple chunk sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods assume sentence-by-sentence alignment, but LLMs produce whole-document outputs that challenge this assumption, requiring new evaluation approaches for document-level machine translation.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Align stage automatically infers sentence-level correspondences and rebuilds target to match source structure; 2) n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage calculates averaged metric scores under 1-4 chunk sizes for multi-granular assessment.

Result: Achieves Pearson correlation of 0.929 with expert MQM rankings on WMT benchmark, aligns closely with human judgments on real-world test set, and enables effective CPO training and GRPO reward modeling that outperform vanilla SFT baseline.

Conclusion: The framework provides an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool for document-level machine translation systems, validated through strong correlation with human judgments and practical utility for training improvements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level
machine translation (\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs
challenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence
alignment. We introduce \textit{\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete
evaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we
automatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild
the target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and
many-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we
calculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for
multi-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson
correlation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly
curated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human
judgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables
effective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both
yielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results
validate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool
for doc-mt systems.

### [130] [NE-PADD: Leveraging Named Entity Knowledge for Robust Partial Audio Deepfake Detection via Attention Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03829)
*Huhong Xian,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NE-PADD is a novel method for partial audio deepfake detection that leverages named entity knowledge through parallel SpeechNER and PADD branches with attention fusion and transfer mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audio deepfake detection operates at sentence level, while partial detection requires frame-level localization. Semantic information from audio, particularly named entities, remains underexplored for this task.

Method: Proposes NE-PADD with two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and PADD. Uses Attention Fusion (AF) to combine attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) with auxiliary loss to guide PADD using named entity semantics.

Result: Experiments on PartialSpoof-NER dataset show the method outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in partial audio deepfake detection.

Conclusion: The integration of named entity knowledge through attention mechanisms significantly improves partial audio deepfake detection performance, providing better frame-level localization of fake speech segments.

Abstract: Different from traditional sentence-level audio deepfake detection (ADD),
partial audio deepfake detection (PADD) requires frame-level positioning of the
location of fake speech. While some progress has been made in this area,
leveraging semantic information from audio, especially named entities, remains
an underexplored aspect. To this end, we propose NE-PADD, a novel method for
Partial Audio Deepfake Detection (PADD) that leverages named entity knowledge
through two parallel branches: Speech Name Entity Recognition (SpeechNER) and
PADD. The approach incorporates two attention aggregation mechanisms: Attention
Fusion (AF) for combining attention weights and Attention Transfer (AT) for
guiding PADD with named entity semantics using an auxiliary loss. Built on the
PartialSpoof-NER dataset, experiments show our method outperforms existing
baselines, proving the effectiveness of integrating named entity knowledge in
PADD. The code is available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/NE-PADD.

*Yang Wang,Chenghao Xiao,Chia-Yi Hsiao,Zi Yan Chang,Chi-Li Chen,Tyler Loakman,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs fail to understand "Drivelology" - syntactically coherent but pragmatically paradoxical text, despite excelling at other NLP tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate LLMs' limitations in understanding layered semantic meaning that requires contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation beyond surface-level coherence.

Method: Created a diverse benchmark dataset of 1,200+ curated Drivelology examples across multiple languages, with expert annotation and adjudication. Evaluated various LLMs on classification, generation, and reasoning tasks.

Result: LLMs consistently fail to grasp Drivelology, confusing it with shallow nonsense, producing incoherent justifications, and missing implied rhetorical functions.

Conclusion: There's a fundamental representational gap in LLMs' pragmatic understanding, showing that statistical fluency doesn't imply true cognitive comprehension of linguistic depth.

Abstract: We introduce Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as
"nonsense with depth", utterances that are syntactically coherent yet
pragmatically paradoxical, emotionally loaded, or rhetorically subversive.
While such expressions may resemble surface-level nonsense, they encode
implicit meaning requiring contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional
interpretation. We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite
excelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to
grasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we
construct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously
curated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,
Japanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the
examples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected
Drivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of
discussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle
and subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on
classification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear
limitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,
produce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function
altogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'
pragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency
implies cognitive comprehension. We release our dataset and code to facilitate
further research in modelling linguistic depth beyond surface-level coherence.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper analyzing how Chain-of-Thought reasoning affects LLM trustworthiness across five dimensions: truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy, finding that while CoT improves some aspects, it introduces new vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in Long-CoT reasoning improving LLM performance, there's limited understanding of how CoT-based reasoning affects language model trustworthiness across key dimensions.

Method: Comprehensive survey of recent reasoning models and CoT techniques, analyzing studies chronologically across five trustworthiness dimensions with detailed methodology and limitation analyses.

Result: Reasoning techniques show promise for enhancing trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation and robustness improvement, but cutting-edge reasoning models themselves suffer from comparable or greater vulnerabilities in safety, robustness, and privacy.

Conclusion: This work serves as a valuable resource for the AI safety community to stay informed on reasoning trustworthiness progress, highlighting both benefits and vulnerabilities of CoT techniques.

Abstract: The development of Long-CoT reasoning has advanced LLM performance across
various tasks, including language understanding, complex problem solving, and
code generation. This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate
reasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,
despite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based
reasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains
underdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and
CoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:
truthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we
provide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological
order, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and
limitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for
reference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for
enhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful
content detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models
themselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in
safety, robustness, and privacy. By synthesizing these insights, we hope this
work serves as a valuable and timely resource for the AI safety community to
stay informed on the latest progress in reasoning trustworthiness. A full list

### [133] [False Sense of Security: Why Probing-based Malicious Input Detection Fails to Generalize](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03888)
*Cheng Wang,Zeming Wei,Qin Liu,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Probing-based safety detection methods in LLMs learn superficial patterns like instructional formats and trigger words rather than semantic harmfulness, creating a false sense of security.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically re-examine probing-based approaches for detecting harmful instructions in LLMs, motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance and concerns about what probes actually learn.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments including comparing n-gram methods, using semantically cleaned datasets, and detailed pattern dependency analysis to understand what probes learn.

Result: Probes learn superficial patterns (instructional patterns and trigger words) rather than semantic harmfulness, demonstrating comparable performance to simple n-gram methods.

Conclusion: Current probing-based approaches create a false sense of security; there's a need to redesign both models and evaluation protocols for responsible safety research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can comply with harmful instructions, raising
serious safety concerns despite their impressive capabilities. Recent work has
leveraged probing-based approaches to study the separability of malicious and
benign inputs in LLMs' internal representations, and researchers have proposed
using such probing methods for safety detection. We systematically re-examine
this paradigm. Motivated by poor out-of-distribution performance, we
hypothesize that probes learn superficial patterns rather than semantic
harmfulness. Through controlled experiments, we confirm this hypothesis and
identify the specific patterns learned: instructional patterns and trigger
words. Our investigation follows a systematic approach, progressing from
demonstrating comparable performance of simple n-gram methods, to controlled
experiments with semantically cleaned datasets, to detailed analysis of pattern
dependencies. These results reveal a false sense of security around current
probing-based approaches and highlight the need to redesign both models and
evaluation protocols, for which we provide further discussions in the hope of
suggesting responsible further research in this direction. We have open-sourced
the project at https://github.com/WangCheng0116/Why-Probe-Fails.

*Gowen Loo,Chang Liu,Qinghong Yin,Xiang Chen,Jiawei Chen,Jingyuan Zhang,Yu Tian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MobileRAG is a mobile agent framework using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to improve smartphone task automation by addressing LLM comprehension errors, lack of environmental interaction, and memory limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based mobile agents suffer from comprehension errors, lack environmental interaction, and have no memory capabilities, leading to task failures and inefficiencies in handling complex mobile operations.

Method: Proposes MobileRAG framework with three components: InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG, leveraging RAG technology to better identify user queries and handle complex mobile tasks through improved retrieval and generation capabilities.

Result: Achieves 10.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps on the challenging MobileRAG-Eval benchmark, demonstrating effective handling of real-world mobile tasks.

Conclusion: MobileRAG successfully addresses key limitations of current mobile agents by integrating RAG technology, providing more accurate and efficient automation of complex smartphone tasks with memory capabilities.

Abstract: Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating
nearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large
language models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These
agents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically
assisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,
current agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can
lead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack
interaction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app
cannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each
instruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and
correct previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,
a mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
which includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly
and accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence
mobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of
MobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark
characterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require
external knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval
demonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving
10.3\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Matrix of Thought (MoT) framework for complex QA that enables multi-dimensional reasoning with column-cell communication and fact-correction mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computation time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought have limitations in handling complex QA tasks - CoT suffers from single-path reasoning and ToT has in-layer redundancy. RAG methods struggle with effectively utilizing large amounts of multi-entity, multi-hop information.

Method: Matrix of Thought (MoT) structure with horizontal and vertical exploration through column-cell communication mechanism. Includes fact-correction using knowledge units from KG triples and raw text. Developed MTQA framework combining these approaches.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four datasets in F1 and EM scores. Achieves 14.4% of baseline reasoning time, demonstrating both efficiency and accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: MoT provides an efficient and accurate framework for complex QA by enabling multi-strategy deep-level thinking while reducing redundancy. The approach effectively enhances LLM reasoning capabilities for complex abstract tasks.

Abstract: Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.
While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they
suffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and
abstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning
abilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures
and single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the
challenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving
multiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the
Matrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT
explores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the
"column-cell communication" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in
multi-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column
cells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a
fact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved
knowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM
reasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an
efficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our
framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in
terms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\% of the baseline
methods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy. The code for this
framework is available at https://github.com/lyfiter/mtqa.

*Iro Lim,Haein Ji,Byungjun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KPoEM is a novel Korean poetry emotion dataset with 7,662 multi-label entries annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories, enabling state-of-the-art emotion classification in modern Korean poetry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Korean poetry remains underexplored in computational emotion analysis due to its figurative language and cultural specificity, despite progress in general text emotion classification.

Method: Built a dataset of 7,662 entries (7,007 line-level, 615 work-level) from 483 poems by 5 Korean poets, annotated with 44 emotion categories. Used sequential fine-tuning of Korean language models - first on general corpora then on KPoEM dataset.

Result: The fine-tuned model achieved 0.60 F1-micro score, significantly outperforming previous models trained on general corpora (0.34 F1-micro). The model showed enhanced ability to identify culturally specific emotional expressions while preserving core sentiments.

Conclusion: KPoEM bridges computational methods and literary analysis, enabling quantitative exploration of poetic emotions while retaining emotional and cultural nuances of Korean literature.

Abstract: This study introduces KPoEM (Korean Poetry Emotion Mapping) , a novel dataset
for computational emotion analysis in modern Korean poetry. Despite remarkable
progress in text-based emotion classification using large language models,
poetry-particularly Korean poetry-remains underexplored due to its figurative
language and cultural specificity. We built a multi-label emotion dataset of
7,662 entries, including 7,007 line-level entries from 483 poems and 615
work-level entries, annotated with 44 fine-grained emotion categories from five
influential Korean poets. A state-of-the-art Korean language model fine-tuned
on this dataset significantly outperformed previous models, achieving 0.60
F1-micro compared to 0.34 from models trained on general corpora. The KPoEM
model, trained through sequential fine-tuning-first on general corpora and then
on the KPoEM dataset-demonstrates not only an enhanced ability to identify
temporally and culturally specific emotional expressions, but also a strong
capacity to preserve the core sentiments of modern Korean poetry. This study
bridges computational methods and literary analysis, presenting new
possibilities for the quantitative exploration of poetic emotions through
structured data that faithfully retains the emotional and cultural nuances of
Korean literature.

TL;DR: SelfAug method prevents catastrophic forgetting in RAG fine-tuning by aligning input sequence logits to preserve model's semantic distribution, achieving better balance between downstream performance and general capability retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning in RAG scenarios causes catastrophic forgetting where models lose previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities. Existing solutions require general instruction data or fail to preserve model's original distribution.

Method: SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution during fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show SelfAug achieves superior balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Analysis reveals direct correlation between distribution shifts and catastrophic forgetting severity in RAG scenarios.

Conclusion: SelfAug advances understanding of catastrophic forgetting in RAG contexts and provides practical solution applicable across diverse fine-tuning scenarios, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPFT-SQL improves self-play fine-tuning for Text-to-SQL by adding verification-based iterative fine-tuning and error-driven loss to handle opponent model errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SPIN faces challenges in Text-to-SQL tasks because it doesn't generate new information and correct SQL queries from opponent models reduce the main model's accuracy.

Method: Proposes SPFT-SQL with two phases: 1) verification-based iterative fine-tuning to create high-quality data and build model base, 2) self-play with error-driven loss that incentivizes learning from opponent's incorrect outputs.

Result: Outperforms existing SOTA methods on six LLMs and five benchmarks through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: SPFT-SQL effectively addresses SPIN's limitations in Text-to-SQL by incorporating verification and error-driven learning, significantly improving SQL generation accuracy.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements of self-play fine-tuning (SPIN), which
can transform a weak large language model (LLM) into a strong one through
competitive interactions between models of varying capabilities, it still faces
challenges in the Text-to-SQL task. SPIN does not generate new information, and
the large number of correct SQL queries produced by the opponent model during
self-play reduces the main model's ability to generate accurate SQL queries. To
address this challenge, we propose a new self-play fine-tuning method tailored
for the Text-to-SQL task, called SPFT-SQL. Prior to self-play, we introduce a
verification-based iterative fine-tuning approach, which synthesizes
high-quality fine-tuning data iteratively based on the database schema and
validation feedback to enhance model performance, while building a model base
with varying capabilities. During the self-play fine-tuning phase, we propose
an error-driven loss method that incentivizes incorrect outputs from the
opponent model, enabling the main model to distinguish between correct SQL and
erroneous SQL generated by the opponent model, thereby improving its ability to
generate correct SQL. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on six
open-source LLMs and five widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: VoxRole is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating speech-based role-playing conversational agents, addressing the lack of standardized evaluation and paralinguistic feature consideration in current RPCA research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RPCA research focuses only on text modality and overlooks critical paralinguistic features like intonation and prosody. There's also a lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for speech-based role-playing, with existing datasets failing to quantify core competencies like long-term persona consistency.

Method: Created VoxRole benchmark with 13,335 multi-turn dialogues (65.6 hours of speech) from 1,228 characters across 261 movies. Used a novel two-stage automated pipeline: first aligning movie audio with scripts, then employing LLMs to build multi-dimensional character profiles.

Result: The benchmark enables multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary spoken dialogue models, revealing their respective strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Conclusion: VoxRole addresses critical gaps in RPCA evaluation by providing the first comprehensive speech-based benchmark that considers paralinguistic features and enables standardized assessment of persona consistency in role-playing conversational agents.

Abstract: Recent significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly
propelled the development of Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs). These
systems aim to create immersive user experiences through consistent persona
adoption. However, current RPCA research faces dual limitations. First,
existing work predominantly focuses on the textual modality, entirely
overlooking critical paralinguistic features including intonation, prosody, and
rhythm in speech, which are essential for conveying character emotions and
shaping vivid identities. Second, the speech-based role-playing domain suffers
from a long-standing lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. Most current
spoken dialogue datasets target only fundamental capability assessments,
featuring thinly sketched or ill-defined character profiles. Consequently, they
fail to effectively quantify model performance on core competencies like
long-term persona consistency. To address this critical gap, we introduce
VoxRole, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for the
evaluation of speech-based RPCAs. The benchmark comprises 13335 multi-turn
dialogues, totaling 65.6 hours of speech from 1228 unique characters across 261
movies. To construct this resource, we propose a novel two-stage automated
pipeline that first aligns movie audio with scripts and subsequently employs an
LLM to systematically build multi-dimensional profiles for each character.
Leveraging VoxRole, we conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation of contemporary
spoken dialogue models, revealing crucial insights into their respective
strengths and limitations in maintaining persona consistency.

Motivation: To systematically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of large language models in fact-checking Chinese misinformation, as their effectiveness remains uncertain despite growing use.

Method: Created CANDY benchmark with ~20k carefully annotated instances, analyzed LLM performance using chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting, developed taxonomy to categorize flawed explanations.

Result: Current LLMs show limitations in generating accurate fact-checking conclusions, with factual fabrication identified as the most common failure mode. LLMs alone are unreliable for fact-checking.

Conclusion: While LLMs are not reliable for standalone fact-checking, they have considerable potential to augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in fact-checking scenarios.

Abstract: The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) to fact-check
misinformation remains uncertain, despite their growing use. To this end, we
present CANDY, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities
and limitations of LLMs in fact-checking Chinese misinformation. Specifically,
we curate a carefully annotated dataset of ~20k instances. Our analysis shows
that current LLMs exhibit limitations in generating accurate fact-checking
conclusions, even when enhanced with chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot
prompting. To understand these limitations, we develop a taxonomy to categorize
flawed LLM-generated explanations for their conclusions and identify factual
fabrication as the most common failure mode. Although LLMs alone are unreliable
for fact-checking, our findings indicate their considerable potential to
augment human performance when deployed as assistive tools in scenarios. Our
dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/SCUNLP/CANDY

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Creating synthetic datasets for Ladin language using Italian parallel data and translation methods to improve NLP tasks and machine translation for this endangered language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs perform poorly on low-resource languages like Ladin due to lack of labeled data, and there are limited high-quality NLP datasets for indigenous languages.

Method: Using parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs to translate monolingual Italian data, creating synthetic datasets for sentiment analysis and MCQA with rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures.

Result: Substantial improvements over existing Italian-Ladin translation baselines when incorporating synthetic datasets into machine translation training.

Conclusion: First publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing foundational resources for broader NLP research and applications for this underrepresented language.

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) diminishes for extremely
low-resource languages, such as indigenous languages, primarily due to the lack
of labeled data. Despite growing interest, the availability of high-quality
natural language processing (NLP) datasets for these languages remains limited,
making it difficult to develop robust language technologies. This paper
addresses such gap by focusing on Ladin, an endangered Romance language,
specifically targeting the Val Badia variant. Leveraging a small set of
parallel Ladin-Italian sentence pairs, we create synthetic datasets for
sentiment analysis and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) by translating
monolingual Italian data. To ensure linguistic quality and reliability, we
apply rigorous filtering and back-translation procedures in our method. We
further demonstrate that incorporating these synthetic datasets into machine
translation training leads to substantial improvements over existing
Italian-Ladin translation baselines. Our contributions include the first
publicly available sentiment analysis and MCQA datasets for Ladin, establishing
foundational resources that can support broader NLP research and downstream
applications for this underrepresented language.

*Zhaoyan Gong,Juan Li,Zhiqiang Liu,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RTQA is a novel framework for temporal knowledge graph question answering that uses recursive decomposition and LLMs to handle complex temporal queries without training, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TKGQA methods struggle with complex temporal queries, limited reasoning abilities, and error propagation in decomposition frameworks, requiring a more robust solution.

Method: RTQA recursively decomposes questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation for fault tolerance through three core components: Temporal Question Decomposer, Recursive Solver, and Answer Aggregator.

Result: Experiments on MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks show significant Hits@1 improvements in 'Multiple' and 'Complex' categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: RTQA effectively addresses limitations of current TKGQA methods by enhancing reasoning capabilities without requiring training, demonstrating superior performance on complex temporal queries.

Abstract: Current temporal knowledge graph question answering (TKGQA) methods primarily
focus on implicit temporal constraints, lacking the capability of handling more
complex temporal queries, and struggle with limited reasoning abilities and
error propagation in decomposition frameworks. We propose RTQA, a novel
framework to address these challenges by enhancing reasoning over TKGs without
requiring training. Following recursive thinking, RTQA recursively decomposes
questions into sub-problems, solves them bottom-up using LLMs and TKG
knowledge, and employs multi-path answer aggregation to improve fault
tolerance. RTQA consists of three core components: the Temporal Question
Decomposer, the Recursive Solver, and the Answer Aggregator. Experiments on
MultiTQ and TimelineKGQA benchmarks demonstrate significant Hits@1 improvements
in "Multiple" and "Complex" categories, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

### [144] [On Robustness and Reliability of Benchmark-Based Evaluation of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04013)
*Riccardo Lunardi,Vincenzo Della Mea,Stefano Mizzaro,Kevin Roitero*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant performance drops when benchmark questions are paraphrased, challenging the reliability of standard evaluations and highlighting robustness issues with linguistic variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether benchmark-based evaluations provide reliable measures of LLM capabilities in real-world scenarios where questions appear in diverse linguistic forms rather than fixed standardized formats.

Method: Systematically generated various paraphrases of all questions across six common benchmarks and measured effectiveness variations across 34 state-of-the-art LLMs of different sizes and capabilities.

Result: While LLM rankings remained relatively stable across paraphrased inputs, absolute effectiveness scores changed significantly and declined, showing models struggle with linguistic variability.

Conclusion: Benchmark scores may not fully capture model robustness to real-world input variations, necessitating robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of
benchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in
their original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,
real-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to
maintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or
query. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to
paraphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based
evaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically
generate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common
benchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34
state-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal
that while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,
absolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests
that LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their
generalization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the
observed performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based
evaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a
model's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications
of these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for
robustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models show increasing cross-lingual consistency as they grow larger and more capable, with models agreeing more with themselves across languages than with other models in the same language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how similar model outputs are across different languages and whether model size and capability affect cross-lingual consistency.

Method: Used the κ_p similarity metric to analyze 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU, comparing model responses across languages and between different models.

Result: Larger and more capable models demonstrate greater consistency in their outputs across languages. Models show higher agreement with their own outputs across different languages than with outputs from other models in the same language.

Conclusion: κ_p is a valuable tool for evaluating multilingual reliability and can guide development of more consistent multilingual systems, as cross-lingual consistency improves with model scale and capability.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this
question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied
to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a
model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size
and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual
consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the
same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a
practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential
to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First automatic Chinese functional syntax annotation system using RoBERTa, achieving 0.852 F1 score for identifying syntactic elements like Subject, Main Verb, and Complement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of automated annotation system for Chinese texts based on Systemic Functional Grammar/Cardiff Grammar theory, which limits application and promotion of these linguistic theories.

Method: Fine-tuned RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model on 4,100 annotated sentences from People's Daily 2014 corpus for named entity recognition of functional syntax elements.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.852 on test set, significantly outperforming other models, with excellent performance on core syntactic elements (Subject, Main Verb, Complement).

Conclusion: Successful first integration of functional syntax with attention-based NLP models, providing new automated method for Chinese syntax analysis and foundation for future research, though room for improvement on imbalanced label samples.

Abstract: Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely
applied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks
across various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system
based on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which
significantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To
fill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model
for Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).
The study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus
and annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset
for training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based
on the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1
score of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative
models. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core
syntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).
Nevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with
imbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with
attention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated
Chinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent
studies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes synthetic sheet music problems based on music theory for evaluating and training LLMs/MLLMs, showing improved reasoning and music composition capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research lacks evaluation benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning, which is crucial for developing AI musicians.

Method: Introduces a data synthesis framework generating verifiable sheet music questions in textual and visual modalities, used for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR).

Result: Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 on MusicTheoryBench, achieves reasoning comparable to GPT-4, and shows improved math performance. Gemini 2.5-Pro performs poorly on visual sheet music interpretation.

Conclusion: First to propose music theory-based synthetic sheet music problems, demonstrating effectiveness in advancing model reasoning for sheet music understanding and enabling AI-assisted music creation.

Abstract: Enhancing the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) to interpret sheet music is a crucial step toward
building AI musicians. However, current research lacks both evaluation
benchmarks and training data for sheet music reasoning. To address this, we
propose the idea of synthesizing sheet music problems grounded in music theory,
which can serve both as evaluation benchmarks and as training data for
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We introduce a data
synthesis framework that generates verifiable sheet music questions in both
textual and visual modalities, leading to the Synthetic Sheet Music Reasoning
Benchmark (SSMR-Bench) and a complementary training set. Evaluation results on
SSMR-Bench show the importance of models' reasoning abilities in interpreting
sheet music. At the same time, the poor performance of Gemini 2.5-Pro
highlights the challenges that MLLMs still face in interpreting sheet music in
a visual format. By leveraging synthetic data for RLVR, Qwen3-8B-Base and
Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct achieve improvements on the SSMR-Bench. Besides, the
trained Qwen3-8B-Base surpasses GPT-4 in overall performance on
MusicTheoryBench and achieves reasoning performance comparable to GPT-4 with
the strategies of Role play and Chain-of-Thought. Notably, its performance on
math problems also improves relative to the original Qwen3-8B-Base.
Furthermore, our results show that the enhanced reasoning ability can also
facilitate music composition. In conclusion, we are the first to propose the
idea of synthesizing sheet music problems based on music theory rules, and
demonstrate its effectiveness not only in advancing model reasoning for sheet
music understanding but also in unlocking new possibilities for AI-assisted
music creation.

Method: Conducted a comprehensive survey of existing Arabic chatbots in education, analyzing their characteristics including adopted approaches, language variety, and performance metrics.

Result: Found that despite the success of chatbots in other languages, only a few educational Arabic chatbots utilize modern techniques like BERT and GPT. Identified significant research gaps in this domain.

Conclusion: There is substantial opportunity for advancement in Arabic educational chatbots through adoption of modern NLP techniques. The study provides guidance for future research directions to bridge this technological gap.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) in general, and in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular, and some of its applications
such as chatbots, have led to their implementation in different domains like
education, healthcare, tourism, and customer service. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, there has been an increasing interest in these digital technologies
to allow and enhance remote access. In education, e-learning systems have been
massively adopted worldwide. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLM) such
as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT
(Generative Pre-trained Transformers) made chatbots even more popular. In this
study, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their
different characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and
metrics used to measure their performance. We were able to identified some
research gaps when we discovered that, despite the success of chatbots in other
languages such as English, only a few educational Arabic chatbots used modern
techniques. Finally, we discuss future directions of research in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a system for detecting and explaining covert narratives in news articles using fine-tuned BERT for multi-label classification and GPT-4o with ReACT framework for evidence-based explanations, enhanced by auxiliary knowledge to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting subtle phrasing and hidden agendas in news content, making it difficult to analyze bias and sentiment through covert narratives and implicit messaging.

Method: Fine-tune BERT model with recall-oriented approach for narrative detection, then use GPT-4o pipeline with ReACT framework (Reasoning + Acting) and semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting for explanations, incorporating structured taxonomy table as auxiliary knowledge base.

Result: Integration of auxiliary knowledge in prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, demonstrating effective narrative detection and explanation capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses multi-label narrative classification and evidence-based explanation generation, with applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Abstract: Understanding covert narratives and implicit messaging is essential for
analyzing bias and sentiment. Traditional NLP methods struggle with detecting
subtle phrasing and hidden agendas. This study tackles two key challenges: (1)
multi-label classification of narratives and sub-narratives in news articles,
and (2) generating concise, evidence-based explanations for dominant
narratives. We fine-tune a BERT model with a recall-oriented approach for
comprehensive narrative detection, refining predictions using a GPT-4o pipeline
for consistency. For narrative explanation, we propose a ReACT (Reasoning +
Acting) framework with semantic retrieval-based few-shot prompting, ensuring
grounded and relevant justifications. To enhance factual accuracy and reduce
hallucinations, we incorporate a structured taxonomy table as an auxiliary
knowledge base. Our results show that integrating auxiliary knowledge in
prompts improves classification accuracy and justification reliability, with
applications in media analysis, education, and intelligence gathering.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study investigates how to create stable personalized lexical profiles from minimal speech data (10 minutes) for implementing lexical alignment in conversational agents, finding optimal profile sizes of 5-10 items per part-of-speech category.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lexical alignment improves human communication but remains underexplored in conversational agents despite recent LLM advancements. The research aims to enable lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue by creating personalized lexical profiles.

Method: Varied amounts of transcribed spoken data and number of items per POS category to construct lexical profiles. Evaluated profile performance over time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics.

Result: Smaller, more compact profiles created from 10 minutes of transcribed speech with 5 items for adjectives/conjunctions and 10 items for adverbs/nouns/pronouns/verbs offered the best balance of performance and data efficiency.

Conclusion: The study provides practical insights for constructing stable personalized lexical profiles with minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step toward implementing lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

Abstract: Lexical alignment, where speakers start to use similar words across
conversation, is known to contribute to successful communication. However, its
implementation in conversational agents remains underexplored, particularly
considering the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). As a first
step towards enabling lexical alignment in human-agent dialogue, this study
draws on strategies for personalising conversational agents and investigates
the construction of stable, personalised lexical profiles as a basis for
lexical alignment. Specifically, we varied the amounts of transcribed spoken
data used for construction as well as the number of items included in the
profiles per part-of-speech (POS) category and evaluated profile performance
across time using recall, coverage, and cosine similarity metrics. It was shown
that smaller and more compact profiles, created after 10 min of transcribed
speech containing 5 items for adjectives, 5 items for conjunctions, and 10
items for adverbs, nouns, pronouns, and verbs each, offered the best balance in
both performance and data efficiency. In conclusion, this study offers
practical insights into constructing stable, personalised lexical profiles,
taking into account minimal data requirements, serving as a foundational step
toward lexical alignment strategies in conversational agents.

TL;DR: Joint modeling of entity and discourse relation features significantly improves coherence assessment performance compared to using either feature type alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing coherence modeling work focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse relations, with little attention to combining both approaches.

Method: Explored two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse relations for coherence assessment.

Result: Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances coherence model performance.

Conclusion: Modeling both entity features and discourse relations simultaneously provides substantial benefits for coherence evaluation.

Abstract: In linguistics, coherence can be achieved by different means, such as by
maintaining reference to the same set of entities across sentences and by
establishing discourse relations between them. However, most existing work on
coherence modeling focuses exclusively on either entity features or discourse
relation features, with little attention given to combining the two. In this
study, we explore two methods for jointly modeling entities and discourse
relations for coherence assessment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets
show that integrating both types of features significantly enhances the
performance of coherence models, highlighting the benefits of modeling both
simultaneously for coherence evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAGneT is a multi-agent framework that generates high-quality synthetic psychological counseling sessions by decomposing counselor responses into specialized sub-tasks handled by different LLM agents, outperforming existing methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a growing need for scalable psychological counseling but limited access to high-quality, privacy-compliant training data for fine-tuning open-source LLMs. Existing single-agent approaches fail to capture the full structure and nuance of real counseling sessions.

Method: A multi-agent framework where specialized LLM agents handle different psychological techniques and sub-tasks in counseling response generation. Also introduces a unified evaluation framework with nine expert-evaluated aspects for comprehensive assessment.

Result: MAGneT significantly outperforms baselines, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on CTRS. Experts prefer MAGneT sessions in 77.2% of cases. Fine-tuning on MAGneT data yields 6.3% and 7.3% improvements respectively.

Conclusion: MAGneT provides a superior approach for generating high-quality synthetic counseling data, enabling better fine-tuning of open-source LLMs for psychological applications while addressing evaluation inconsistencies in prior work.

Abstract: The growing demand for scalable psychological counseling highlights the need
for fine-tuning open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) with high-quality,
privacy-compliant data, yet such data remains scarce. Here we introduce MAGneT,
a novel multi-agent framework for synthetic psychological counseling session
generation that decomposes counselor response generation into coordinated
sub-tasks handled by specialized LLM agents, each modeling a key psychological
technique. Unlike prior single-agent approaches, MAGneT better captures the
structure and nuance of real counseling. In addition, we address
inconsistencies in prior evaluation protocols by proposing a unified evaluation
framework integrating diverse automatic and expert metrics. Furthermore, we
expand the expert evaluations from four aspects of counseling in previous works
to nine aspects, enabling a more thorough and robust assessment of data
quality. Empirical results show that MAGneT significantly outperforms existing
methods in quality, diversity, and therapeutic alignment of the generated
counseling sessions, improving general counseling skills by 3.2% and
CBT-specific skills by 4.3% on average on cognitive therapy rating scale
(CTRS). Crucially, experts prefer MAGneT-generated sessions in 77.2% of cases
on average across all aspects. Moreover, fine-tuning an open-source model on
MAGneT-generated sessions shows better performance, with improvements of 6.3%
on general counseling skills and 7.3% on CBT-specific skills on average on CTRS
over those fine-tuned with sessions generated by baseline methods. We also make
our code and data public.

TL;DR: SED-Aug is a dual augmentation framework combining explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to improve social event detection without costly manual annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social event detection relies on labeled data but annotation is expensive and labor-intensive, creating a need for automated data enhancement methods.

Method: Combines explicit text augmentation using LLMs with five generation strategies and implicit feature-space augmentation using five novel perturbation techniques on structural fused embeddings.

Result: Outperforms best baseline by 17.67% on Twitter2012 and 15.57% on Twitter2018 datasets in average F1 score.

Conclusion: SED-Aug effectively enhances data diversity and model robustness for social event detection through dual augmentation approach.

Abstract: Social event detection involves identifying and categorizing important events
from social media, which relies on labeled data, but annotation is costly and
labor-intensive. To address this problem, we propose Augmentation framework for
Social Event Detection (SED-Aug), a plug-and-play dual augmentation framework,
which combines explicit text-based and implicit feature-space augmentation to
enhance data diversity and model robustness. The explicit augmentation utilizes
large language models to enhance textual information through five diverse
generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel
perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused
embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational
properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse. Specifically, SED-Aug
outperforms the best baseline model by approximately 17.67% on the Twitter2012
dataset and by about 15.57% on the Twitter2018 dataset in terms of the average
F1 score. The code is available at GitHub: https://github.com/congboma/SED-Aug.

TL;DR: Inverse IFEval benchmark measures LLMs' counter-intuitive ability to override training biases and follow adversarial instructions, revealing cognitive inertia issues in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often struggle with cognitive inertia - they fail to follow instructions that conflict with standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning, limiting their real-world adaptability.

Method: Proposed Inverse IFEval benchmark with 8 challenge types (Question Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, etc.), created 1012 high-quality Chinese/English questions across 23 domains using human-in-the-loop pipeline, evaluated using optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework.

Result: Experiments on leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of the benchmark, showing models' limitations in handling counter-intuitive instructions and adversarial scenarios.

Conclusion: Future alignment should focus not just on fluency and factual correctness but also adaptability in unconventional contexts. Inverse IFEval serves as diagnostic tool and foundation for methods to mitigate cognitive inertia and enhance instruction-following reliability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on diverse tasks but
often exhibit cognitive inertia, struggling to follow instructions that
conflict with the standardized patterns learned during supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). To evaluate this limitation, we propose Inverse IFEval, a benchmark that
measures models Counter-intuitive Abilitytheir capacity to override
training-induced biases and comply with adversarial instructions. Inverse
IFEval introduces eight types of such challenges, including Question
Correction, Intentional Textual Flaws, Code without Comments, and
Counterfactual Answering. Using a human-in-the-loop pipeline, we construct a
dataset of 1012 high-quality Chinese and English questions across 23 domains,
evaluated under an optimized LLM-as-a-Judge framework. Experiments on existing
leading LLMs demonstrate the necessity of our proposed Inverse IFEval
benchmark. Our findings emphasize that future alignment efforts should not only
pursue fluency and factual correctness but also account for adaptability under
unconventional contexts. We hope that Inverse IFEval serves as both a
diagnostic tool and a foundation for developing methods that mitigate cognitive
inertia, reduce overfitting to narrow patterns, and ultimately enhance the
instruction-following reliability of LLMs in diverse and unpredictable
real-world scenarios.

### [156] [Facts Fade Fast: Evaluating Memorization of Outdated Medical Knowledge in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04304)
*Juraj Vladika,Mahdi Dhaini,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs in healthcare risk providing outdated medical advice due to static training data. Two new QA datasets (MedRevQA and MedChangeQA) reveal consistent reliance on obsolete knowledge across 8 major LLMs, highlighting the need for more current medical AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models show promise for healthcare but their static training data poses risks when medical knowledge evolves, potentially leading to harmful outdated advice and poor clinical reasoning.

Method: Created two novel question-answering datasets from systematic reviews: MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs) for general biomedical knowledge and MedChangeQA (512 QA pairs) tracking medical consensus changes over time. Evaluated 8 prominent LLMs on these datasets.

Result: All evaluated LLMs showed consistent reliance on outdated medical knowledge. Analysis revealed the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies as contributing factors to this phenomenon.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the critical problem of outdated medical knowledge in LLMs and provides groundwork for developing mitigation strategies to create more current and reliable medical AI systems.

Abstract: The growing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant
potential to enhance healthcare by assisting medical researchers and
physicians. However, their reliance on static training data is a major risk
when medical recommendations evolve with new research and developments. When
LLMs memorize outdated medical knowledge, they can provide harmful advice or
fail at clinical reasoning tasks. To investigate this problem, we introduce two
novel question-answering (QA) datasets derived from systematic reviews:
MedRevQA (16,501 QA pairs covering general biomedical knowledge) and
MedChangeQA (a subset of 512 QA pairs where medical consensus has changed over
time). Our evaluation of eight prominent LLMs on the datasets reveals
consistent reliance on outdated knowledge across all models. We additionally
analyze the influence of obsolete pre-training data and training strategies to
explain this phenomenon and propose future directions for mitigation, laying
the groundwork for developing more current and reliable medical AI systems.

*Jiajun He,Naoki Sawada,Koichi Miyazaki,Tomoki Toda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARCO improves contextual ASR by integrating phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical filtering to better handle domain-specific named entities and homophones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ASR systems struggle with domain-specific named entities, particularly homophones, and contextual ASR methods have limited entity diversity and treat entities as independent tokens, leading to incomplete multi-token biasing.

Method: Proposes PARCO framework with four key components: phoneme-aware encoding for phonetic discrimination, contrastive entity disambiguation, entity-level supervision for complete entity retrieval, and hierarchical entity filtering to reduce false positives.

Result: Achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. Also shows robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and LibriSpeech.

Conclusion: PARCO effectively addresses the limitations of existing contextual ASR methods by enhancing phonetic discrimination, ensuring complete entity retrieval, and reducing false positives, demonstrating superior performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems struggle with domain-specific
named entities, especially homophones. Contextual ASR improves recognition but
often fails to capture fine-grained phoneme variations due to limited entity
diversity. Moreover, prior methods treat entities as independent tokens,
leading to incomplete multi-token biasing. To address these issues, we propose
Phoneme-Augmented Robust Contextual ASR via COntrastive entity disambiguation
(PARCO), which integrates phoneme-aware encoding, contrastive entity
disambiguation, entity-level supervision, and hierarchical entity filtering.
These components enhance phonetic discrimination, ensure complete entity
retrieval, and reduce false positives under uncertainty. Experiments show that
PARCO achieves CER of 4.22% on Chinese AISHELL-1 and WER of 11.14% on English
DATA2 under 1,000 distractors, significantly outperforming baselines. PARCO
also demonstrates robust gains on out-of-domain datasets like THCHS-30 and
LibriSpeech.

### [158] [Measuring Bias or Measuring the Task: Understanding the Brittle Nature of LLM Gender Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04373)
*Bufan Gao,Elisa Kreiss*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM gender bias evaluations are highly sensitive to prompt design - minor changes can substantially alter or even reverse bias outcomes, raising questions about ecological validity of benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in socially impactful settings, there's growing concern about gender bias, but current evaluation methods may not reflect natural language distributions and could be influenced by how the testing context is signaled.

Method: Tested models under different prompt conditions that make testing context and gender-focused content salient, using four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice metrics.

Result: Even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias outcomes, sometimes reversing direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures.

Conclusion: Findings highlight brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations and raise important questions about whether well-controlled testing designs trigger 'testing mode' performance, challenging the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns
about gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate
such bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from
natural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed
task prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender
bias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative
purpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test
models under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and
(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity
across four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice
metrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias
outcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics
further tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings
do not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a
new puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent
can well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,
and what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.

### [159] [Can Language Models Handle a Non-Gregorian Calendar?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04432)
*Mutsumi Sasaki,Go Kamoda,Ryosuke Takahashi,Kosuke Sato,Kentaro Inui,Keisuke Sakaguchi,Benjamin Heinzerling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of language models' ability to handle Japanese calendar tasks, revealing limitations in non-Gregorian calendar understanding despite some conversion capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work on temporal reasoning in LMs has focused solely on the Gregorian calendar, ignoring culturally significant non-Gregorian systems like Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew calendars that are actively used worldwide.

Method: Created datasets for four tasks requiring temporal knowledge and reasoning, then evaluated a range of English-centric and Japanese-centric language models on their Japanese calendar handling capabilities.

Result: Some models could perform basic calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggled with Japanese-calendar arithmetic and maintaining consistency across different calendar systems.

Conclusion: Current language models lack adequate culture-specific calendar understanding, highlighting the need for developing LMs better equipped to handle diverse temporal systems beyond the Gregorian calendar.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language
models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal
reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar.
However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew
calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of
time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian
calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic
evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system:
the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks
that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range
of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can
perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with
Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars.
Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped
for culture-specific calendar understanding.

### [160] [The Optimiser Hidden in Plain Sight: Training with the Loss Landscape's Induced Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03594)
*Thomas R. Harvey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel Riemannian geometry-based optimizers that use loss landscape embedding metrics, showing effectiveness in low dimensions and slight improvements over state-of-the-art methods with automatic learning rate adjustment in high-curvature regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the Riemannian metric naturally induced when loss landscapes are embedded in higher-dimensional space, which underlies common visualizations of loss landscapes, to develop more effective optimization methods.

Method: Developed a new class of optimizers using the induced Riemannian metric from loss landscape embeddings. Compared against SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon across various tasks and architectures. The method can modify existing preconditioning methods and has computational complexity comparable to Adam.

Result: The new optimizers are highly effective in low-dimensional examples and provide slight improvement over state-of-the-art methods. They automatically decrease effective learning rate in high-curvature regions (acting as smoothed gradient clipping) and one variant induces effective scheduled learning rate with natural decoupled weight decay.

Conclusion: This geometric perspective yields optimizers with theoretically desirable properties and practical effectiveness, particularly benefiting from automatic curvature-based learning rate adjustment while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to existing methods.

Abstract: We present a class of novel optimisers for training neural networks that
makes use of the Riemannian metric naturally induced when the loss landscape is
embedded in higher-dimensional space. This is the same metric that underlies
common visualisations of loss landscapes. By taking this geometric perspective
literally and using the induced metric, we develop a new optimiser and compare
it to existing methods, namely: SGD, Adam, AdamW, and Muon, across a range of
tasks and architectures. Empirically, we conclude that this new class of
optimisers is highly effective in low dimensional examples, and provides slight
improvement over state-of-the-art methods for training neural networks. These
new optimisers have theoretically desirable properties. In particular, the
effective learning rate is automatically decreased in regions of high curvature
acting as a smoothed out form of gradient clipping. Similarly, one variant of
these optimisers can also be viewed as inducing an effective scheduled learning
rate and decoupled weight decay is the natural choice from our geometric
perspective. The basic method can be used to modify any existing
preconditioning method. The new optimiser has a computational complexity
comparable to that of Adam.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CEHR-GPT is a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that unifies feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation in a single architecture with time-token-based learning for temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most AI models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Developed CEHR-GPT with a novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients' dynamic timelines into the model structure, enabling temporal reasoning over clinical sequences.

Result: CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks (feature representation, zero-shot prediction, synthetic data generation) and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The model's versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without the need for task-specific retraining, making it highly practical for real-world healthcare applications.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient
health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support,
risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial
intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose
tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings.
Here, we present CEHR-GPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that
unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot
prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To
support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, \cehrgpt{} incorporates a
novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients'
dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-GPT demonstrates strong
performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external
datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables
rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting
without the need for task-specific retraining.

*E. Khalafyan,A. E. Allahverdyan,A. Hovhannisyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NMF and PCC are closely related - PCC helps estimate robust NMF rank that resolves nonidentifiability, while NMF enables approximate PCC implementation for clustering and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the reciprocal relationship between Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and the Principle of Common Cause (PCC) from probabilistic causality, and leverage their connection for improved data analysis.

Method: Used PCC as predictability tool to estimate effective NMF rank, implemented NMF around this rank, and developed clustering method where data points with same common cause are grouped together. Applied to gray-scale image datasets mapped into probability models.

Result: PCC-based rank estimate is stable against weak noise, produces stable basis images, resolves NMF nonidentifiability. NMF enables approximate PCC implementation where larger joint probabilities are better explained, and can be used for data denoising.

Conclusion: NMF and PCC have strong reciprocal relationship - PCC provides robust rank estimation for NMF, while NMF offers practical implementation of PCC for clustering and denoising applications, creating synergy between unsupervised dimensionality reduction and probabilistic causality.

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a known unsupervised data-reduction
method. The principle of the common cause (PCC) is a basic methodological
approach in probabilistic causality, which seeks an independent mixture model
for the joint probability of two dependent random variables. It turns out that
these two concepts are closely related. This relationship is explored
reciprocally for several datasets of gray-scale images, which are conveniently
mapped into probability models. On one hand, PCC provides a predictability tool
that leads to a robust estimation of the effective rank of NMF. Unlike other
estimates (e.g., those based on the Bayesian Information Criteria), our
estimate of the rank is stable against weak noise. We show that NMF implemented
around this rank produces features (basis images) that are also stable against
noise and against seeds of local optimization, thereby effectively resolving
the NMF nonidentifiability problem. On the other hand, NMF provides an
interesting possibility of implementing PCC in an approximate way, where larger
and positively correlated joint probabilities tend to be explained better via
the independent mixture model. We work out a clustering method, where data
points with the same common cause are grouped into the same cluster. We also
show how NMF can be employed for data denoising.

*Yunkai Bao,Reza Safarzadeh,Xin Wang,Steve Drew*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedDeCAB is a semi-decentralized client selection method for federated learning that addresses client availability issues with time-series data, using probabilistic rankings and neighbor-assisted optimization to improve performance and reduce communication overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning in IoT scenarios faces challenges with client availability, energy constraints, and data heterogeneity. Effective client selection is crucial for global model convergence and balancing client contributions, especially with time-series data where availability patterns vary.

Method: Proposed FedDeCAB method with three availability scenarios for time-series data. Uses probabilistic rankings for client selection and allows disconnected clients to obtain partial model parameters from nearest neighbors for joint optimization in a semi-decentralized approach.

Result: Experiments on real-world large-scale taxi and vessel trajectory datasets demonstrate effectiveness under highly heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic client offline/rejoining scenarios.

Conclusion: FedDeCAB successfully addresses client availability challenges in federated learning with time-series data, improving offline model performance while reducing communication overhead through its novel semi-decentralized approach with neighbor-assisted optimization.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) effectively promotes collaborative training among
distributed clients with privacy considerations in the Internet of Things (IoT)
scenarios. Despite of data heterogeneity, FL clients may also be constrained by
limited energy and availability budgets. Therefore, effective selection of
clients participating in training is of vital importance for the convergence of
the global model and the balance of client contributions. In this paper, we
discuss the performance impact of client availability with time-series data on
federated learning. We set up three different scenarios that affect the
availability of time-series data and propose FedDeCAB, a novel,
semi-decentralized client selection method applying probabilistic rankings of
available clients. When a client is disconnected from the server, FedDeCAB
allows obtaining partial model parameters from the nearest neighbor clients for
joint optimization, improving the performance of offline models and reducing
communication overhead. Experiments based on real-world large-scale taxi and
vessel trajectory datasets show that FedDeCAB is effective under highly
heterogeneous data distribution, limited communication budget, and dynamic
client offline or rejoining.

*Arpan Mukherjee,Marcello Bullo,Deniz Gündüz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SharedRep-RLHF is a new framework that learns shared traits across groups instead of separate reward models, addressing MaxMin-RLHF's poor performance with minority groups and achieving up to 20% win rate improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RLHF fails to capture diverse opinions across sub-populations and favors dominant groups. MaxMin-RLHF addresses fairness but performs poorly when the minimum-reward group is a minority.

Method: SharedRep-RLHF learns shared traits in annotations among various groups rather than learning separate group-specific reward models like MaxMin-RLHF.

Result: Experiments show SharedRep-RLHF outperforms MaxMin-RLHF with up to 20% gain in win rate across diverse natural language tasks.

Conclusion: SharedRep-RLHF effectively addresses the limitations of MaxMin-RLHF by leveraging shared traits across groups, providing better performance especially for minority groups.

Abstract: Uniform-reward reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which
trains a single reward model to represent the preferences of all annotators,
fails to capture the diversity of opinions across sub-populations,
inadvertently favoring dominant groups. The state-of-the-art, MaxMin-RLHF,
addresses this by learning group-specific reward models, and by optimizing for
the group receiving the minimum reward, thereby promoting fairness. However, we
identify that a key limitation of MaxMin-RLHF is its poor performance when the
minimum-reward group is a minority. To mitigate this drawback, we introduce a
novel framework, termed {\em SharedRep-RLHF}. At its core, SharedRep-RLHF
learns and leverages {\em shared traits} in annotations among various groups,
in contrast to learning separate reward models across groups. We first show
that MaxMin-RLHF is provably suboptimal in learning shared traits, and then
quantify the sample complexity of SharedRep-RLHF. Experiments across diverse
natural language tasks showcase the effectiveness of SharedRep-RLHF compared to
MaxMin-RLHF with a gain of up to 20% in win rate.

Motivation: To address efficiency loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission in supply chains by integrating economic theories with machine learning technology to create a collaborative SCM-FSCM framework.

Method: Combines Transaction Cost and Information Asymmetry theories with machine learning algorithms including random forests, LSTM networks for demand forecasting, clustering/regression for benefit allocation, Game Theory with reinforcement learning for inventory optimization, and XGBoost for credit assessment.

Result: 30% increase in inventory turnover, 18%-22% decrease in SME financing costs, stable order fulfillment rate above 95%, demand forecasting error <= 8%, and credit assessment accuracy >= 90% when verified with 20 core and 100 supporting enterprises.

Conclusion: The SCM-FSCM model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints, and supports high-quality supply chain development through data-driven optimization and machine learning integration.

Abstract: Based on economic theories and integrated with machine learning technology,
this study explores a collaborative Supply Chain Management and Financial
Supply Chain Management (SCM - FSCM) model to solve issues like efficiency
loss, financing constraints, and risk transmission. We combine Transaction Cost
and Information Asymmetry theories and use algorithms such as random forests to
process multi-dimensional data and build a data-driven, three-dimensional
(cost-efficiency-risk) analysis framework. We then apply an FSCM model of "core
enterprise credit empowerment plus dynamic pledge financing." We use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for demand forecasting and
clustering/regression algorithms for benefit allocation. The study also
combines Game Theory and reinforcement learning to optimize the
inventory-procurement mechanism and uses eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
for credit assessment to enable rapid monetization of inventory. Verified with
20 core and 100 supporting enterprises, the results show a 30\% increase in
inventory turnover, an 18\%-22\% decrease in SME financing costs, a stable
order fulfillment rate above 95\%, and excellent model performance (demand
forecasting error <= 8\%, credit assessment accuracy >= 90\%). This SCM-FSCM
model effectively reduces operating costs, alleviates financing constraints,
and supports high-quality supply chain development.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN show method maintains or improves test accuracy even under strong generalization scenarios.

Conclusion: Study highlights importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics and provides insights for future optimization research, demonstrating practical benefits of gradient-aware normalization.

Abstract: Gradient dynamics play a central role in determining the stability and
generalization of deep neural networks. In this work, we provide an empirical
analysis of how variance and standard deviation of gradients evolve during
training, showing consistent changes across layers and at the global scale in
convolutional networks. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
hyperparameter-free gradient normalization method that aligns gradient scaling
with their natural evolution. This approach prevents unintended amplification,
stabilizes optimization, and preserves convergence guarantees. Experiments on
the challenging CIFAR-100 benchmark with ResNet-20, ResNet-56, and VGG-16-BN
demonstrate that our method maintains or improves test accuracy even under
strong generalization. Beyond practical performance, our study highlights the
importance of directly tracking gradient dynamics, aiming to bridge the gap
between theoretical expectations and empirical behaviors, and to provide
insights for future optimization research.

TL;DR: Graph random features enable scalable Gaussian processes on graphs with O(N^{3/2}) time complexity instead of O(N^3), allowing Bayesian optimization on graphs with over 1 million nodes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable Bayesian inference and Gaussian processes on large graph-structured data, overcoming the computational limitations of exact kernel methods that scale cubically with the number of nodes.

Method: Apply graph random features (GRFs) as stochastic estimators of graph node kernels for Gaussian processes on discrete input spaces, providing theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions.

Result: Achieves substantial wall-clock speedups and memory savings, enabling Bayesian optimization on graphs with over 1 million nodes on a single computer chip while maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: GRFs provide an efficient and scalable approach for Bayesian inference on large graphs, significantly reducing computational complexity from O(N^3) to O(N^{3/2}) while preserving performance.

Abstract: We study the application of graph random features (GRFs) - a recently
introduced stochastic estimator of graph node kernels - to scalable Gaussian
processes on discrete input spaces. We prove that (under mild assumptions)
Bayesian inference with GRFs enjoys $O(N^{3/2})$ time complexity with respect
to the number of nodes $N$, compared to $O(N^3)$ for exact kernels. Substantial
wall-clock speedups and memory savings unlock Bayesian optimisation on graphs
with over $10^6$ nodes on a single computer chip, whilst preserving competitive
performance.

Result: Developed a prototype of HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and released open-source code to demonstrate potential and foster exploration in this field.

Conclusion: HF-FMs represent a novel paradigm that addresses critical heterogeneity challenges in distributed systems while enabling efficient deployment of multi-modal multi-task foundation models across hierarchical network infrastructures.

Abstract: The rise of foundation models (FMs) has reshaped the landscape of machine
learning. As these models continued to grow, leveraging geo-distributed data
from wireless devices has become increasingly critical, giving rise to
federated foundation models (FFMs). More recently, FMs have evolved into
multi-modal multi-task (M3T) FMs (e.g., GPT-4) capable of processing diverse
modalities across multiple tasks, which motivates a new underexplored paradigm:
M3T FFMs. In this paper, we unveil an unexplored variation of M3T FFMs by
proposing hierarchical federated foundation models (HF-FMs), which in turn
expose two overlooked heterogeneity dimensions to fog/edge networks that have a
direct impact on these emerging models: (i) heterogeneity in collected
modalities and (ii) heterogeneity in executed tasks across fog/edge nodes.
HF-FMs strategically align the modular structure of M3T FMs, comprising
modality encoders, prompts, mixture-of-experts (MoEs), adapters, and task
heads, with the hierarchical nature of fog/edge infrastructures. Moreover,
HF-FMs enable the optional usage of device-to-device (D2D) communications,
enabling horizontal module relaying and localized cooperative training among
nodes when feasible. Through delving into the architectural design of HF-FMs,
we highlight their unique capabilities along with a series of tailored future
research directions. Finally, to demonstrate their potential, we prototype
HF-FMs in a wireless network setting and release the open-source code for the
development of HF-FMs with the goal of fostering exploration in this untapped
field (GitHub: https://github.com/payamsiabd/M3T-FFM).

*Tristan Luca Saidi,Abigail Hickok,Bastian Rieck,Andrew J. Blumberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EmbedOR is a new SNE algorithm that uses discrete graph curvature to better preserve data geometry and prevent spurious fragmentation in visualizations compared to UMAP and tSNE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SNE algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often fail to preserve the true geometry of noisy high-dimensional data, spuriously separating connected components and missing clusters in well-clusterable data.

Method: Proposes EmbedOR algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature with a curvature-enhanced distance metric to emphasize underlying cluster structure during stochastic embedding.

Result: EmbedOR preserves geometry better than other SNE algorithms, is less likely to fragment continuous high-density regions, and provides mathematical consistency guarantees. The distance metric can also annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation.

Conclusion: EmbedOR addresses key limitations of current SNE methods by leveraging graph curvature, offering improved visualization quality and deeper geometric insights into high-dimensional data.

Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) algorithms like UMAP and tSNE often
produce visualizations that do not preserve the geometry of noisy and high
dimensional data. In particular, they can spuriously separate connected
components of the underlying data submanifold and can fail to find clusters in
well-clusterable data. To address these limitations, we propose EmbedOR, a SNE
algorithm that incorporates discrete graph curvature. Our algorithm
stochastically embeds the data using a curvature-enhanced distance metric that
emphasizes underlying cluster structure. Critically, we prove that the EmbedOR
distance metric extends consistency results for tSNE to a much broader class of
datasets. We also describe extensive experiments on synthetic and real data
that demonstrate the visualization and geometry-preservation capabilities of
EmbedOR. We find that, unlike other SNE algorithms and UMAP, EmbedOR is much
less likely to fragment continuous, high-density regions of the data. Finally,
we demonstrate that the EmbedOR distance metric can be used as a tool to
annotate existing visualizations to identify fragmentation and provide deeper
insight into the underlying geometry of the data.

### [172] [Online Learning of Optimal Sequential Testing Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03707)
*Qiyuan Chen,Raed Al Kontar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper studies the Online Testing Problem (OTP) where optimal testing policies must be learned online for sequential subjects with correlated, costly tests. The key finding is that missing data from partial testing creates fundamental challenges, leading to Ω(T^{2/3}) minimax regret instead of the typical Θ(√T) rate for standard MDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world testing scenarios often involve correlated and costly tests where conducting all tests for every subject is impractical. The joint distribution of test outcomes is unknown and must be learned online, but partial testing creates missing data that biases estimates, making this problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic MDPs.

Method: The authors analyze the OTP as a Markov Decision Process with unknown distributions. They prove a minimax regret lower bound of Ω(T^{2/3}) and develop an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm that achieves Õ(T^{2/3}) regret for both discrete and Gaussian distributions. They also study a variant with missingness-independent rewards using iterative-elimination.

Result: The paper establishes that the minimax regret for OTP must scale at least as Ω(T^{2/3}), which is strictly worse than the Θ(√T) rate for standard episodic MDPs. The proposed Explore-Then-Commit algorithm matches this lower bound with Õ(T^{2/3}) cumulative regret. For the variant with missingness-independent rewards, they achieve Õ(√T) regret.

Conclusion: Missing data in online testing problems fundamentally increases the difficulty of exploration-exploitation trade-offs, leading to higher regret bounds. The work provides theoretical understanding and practical algorithms for efficient sequential testing policies under missing data, with implications for real-world testing scenarios where partial information is common.

Abstract: This paper studies an online learning problem that seeks optimal testing
policies for a stream of subjects, each of whom can be evaluated through a
sequence of candidate tests drawn from a common pool. We refer to this problem
as the Online Testing Problem (OTP). Although conducting every candidate test
for a subject provides more information, it is often preferable to select only
a subset when tests are correlated and costly, and make decisions with partial
information. If the joint distribution of test outcomes were known, the problem
could be cast as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved exactly. In
practice, this distribution is unknown and must be learned online as subjects
are tested. When a subject is not fully tested, the resulting missing data can
bias estimates, making the problem fundamentally harder than standard episodic
MDPs. We prove that the minimax regret must scale at least as
$\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$, in contrast to the $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ rate in
episodic MDPs, revealing the difficulty introduced by missingness. This
elevated lower bound is then matched by an Explore-Then-Commit algorithm whose
cumulative regret is $\tilde{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for both discrete and
Gaussian distributions. To highlight the consequence of missingness-dependent
rewards in OTP, we study a variant called the Online Cost-sensitive Maximum
Entropy Sampling Problem, where rewards are independent of missing data. This
structure enables an iterative-elimination algorithm that achieves
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, breaking the $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ lower
bound for OTP. Numerical results confirm our theory in both settings. Overall,
this work deepens the understanding of the exploration--exploitation trade-off
under missing data and guides the design of efficient sequential testing
policies.

*Ibne Farabi Shihab,Sanjeda Akter,Anuj Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differentiable range-partition entropy estimator enables deep learning algorithms to adapt to input sortedness, achieving significant speedups in geometry (4.1×) and improved accuracy in Transformers (6% higher at 80% sparsity).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Range-partition entropy provides strong theoretical guarantees in algorithm design but hasn't been accessible to deep learning. The goal is to make this concept differentiable for use as trainable loss/regularizer.

Method: Proposed differentiable approximation of range-partition entropy, designed EntropyNet neural module to restructure data into low-entropy forms, and applied entropy regularization directly to Transformer attention.

Result: Achieved 4.1× runtime speedups with <0.2% error in geometry tasks, and 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1 baselines in deep learning applications.

Conclusion: Entropy-bounded computation is both theoretically elegant and practically effective for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured representation in deep learning systems.

Abstract: We introduce a differentiable estimator of range-partition entropy, a recent
concept from computational geometry that enables algorithms to adapt to the
"sortedness" of their input. While range-partition entropy provides strong
guarantees in algorithm design, it has not yet been made accessible to deep
learning. In this work, we (i) propose the first differentiable approximation
of range-partition entropy, enabling its use as a trainable loss or
regularizer; (ii) design EntropyNet, a neural module that restructures data
into low-entropy forms to accelerate downstream instance-optimal algorithms;
and (iii) extend this principle beyond geometry by applying entropy
regularization directly to Transformer attention. Across tasks, we demonstrate
that differentiable entropy improves efficiency without degrading correctness:
in geometry, our method achieves up to $4.1\times$ runtime speedups with
negligible error ($<0.2%$); in deep learning, it induces structured attention
patterns that yield 6% higher accuracy at 80% sparsity compared to L1
baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides approximation bounds for the
estimator, and extensive ablations validate design choices. These results
suggest that entropy-bounded computation is not only theoretically elegant but
also a practical mechanism for adaptive learning, efficiency, and structured
representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored representational properties of neural operators in scientific computing and test the Platonic Representation Hypothesis across different architectures.

Method: Extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, comparing inference and training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators.

Result: Lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators and demonstrates unique properties of resolution robustness in neural operators.

Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of
sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces,
enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the
Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to
similar representations across architectures, the representational properties
of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in
scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs,
lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator
modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery,
improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying
resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.

*Livia Betti,Farooq Sanni,Gnouyaro Sogoyou,Togbe Agbagla,Cullen Molitor,Tamma Carleton,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First framework for optimizing spatial training data collection in satellite ML, addressing data sparsity and cost constraints with novel methods that show substantial performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite ML applications suffer from sparse, clustered labeled data despite global coverage, creating uncertainty about additional data collection for large-scale monitoring.

Method: Novel problem formulation for spatial training data optimization with heterogeneous costs and budget constraints, plus methods to address this problem across various settings.

Result: Experiments across three continents and four tasks show substantial performance gains from optimized sampling strategies, with delineated effective settings.

Conclusion: The framework generalizes across SatML domains and provides immediate practical value for augmenting agricultural surveys in Togo and similar applications.

Abstract: In applications across agriculture, ecology, and human development, machine
learning with satellite imagery (SatML) is limited by the sparsity of labeled
training data. While satellite data cover the globe, labeled training datasets
for SatML are often small, spatially clustered, and collected for other
purposes (e.g., administrative surveys or field measurements). Despite the
pervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely
focused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce
training data, rather than modeling data conditions directly. This leaves
scientists and policymakers who wish to use SatML for large-scale monitoring
uncertain about whether and how to collect additional data to maximize
performance. Here, we present the first problem formulation for the
optimization of spatial training data in the presence of heterogeneous data
collection costs and realistic budget constraints, as well as novel methods for
addressing this problem. In experiments simulating different problem settings
across three continents and four tasks, our strategies reveal substantial gains
from sample optimization. Further experiments delineate settings for which
optimized sampling is particularly effective. The problem formulation and
methods we introduce are designed to generalize across application domains for
SatML; we put special emphasis on a specific problem setting where our
coauthors can immediately use our findings to augment clustered agricultural
surveys for SatML monitoring in Togo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient method for approximating real-valued functions on smooth manifolds that can handle high-dimensional data challenges while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Builds on Diffusion Maps framework, uses diffusion geometry connected to heat equation and Laplace-Beltrami operator. Introduces SVD-based dimensionality reduction for distance matrices and online updating mechanism for new data incorporation.

Result: Outperforms classical feedforward neural networks and interpolation methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrated through numerical experiments including sparse CT reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides an effective and scalable approach for function approximation on manifolds, particularly suitable for high-dimensional data applications with computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a data-driven method for approximating real-valued functions on
smooth manifolds, building on the Diffusion Maps framework under the manifold
hypothesis. Given pointwise evaluations of a function, the method constructs a
smooth extension to the ambient space by exploiting diffusion geometry and its
connection to the heat equation and the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
  To address the computational challenges of high-dimensional data, we
introduce a dimensionality reduction strategy based on the low-rank structure
of the distance matrix, revealed via singular value decomposition (SVD). In
addition, we develop an online updating mechanism that enables efficient
incorporation of new data, thereby improving scalability and reducing
computational cost.
  Numerical experiments, including applications to sparse CT reconstruction,
demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms classical feedforward
neural networks and interpolation methods in terms of both accuracy and

TL;DR: Adversarial co-evolution framework where an Attacker agent generates increasingly difficult challenges to train Defender agents, creating a self-scaling curriculum for robust agent development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of hand-crafted training environments by developing world models that scale in complexity alongside learning agents for truly generalizable and robust embodied intelligence.

Method: Goal-conditioned generative world model where an Attacker agent learns to synthesize challenging world states to exploit Defender weaknesses, while Defender team learns cooperative policies against these generated challenges.

Result: Emergence of complex behaviors including flanking/shielding formations by the world model and coordinated focus-fire/spreading tactics by defenders, demonstrating strategic depth and robustness.

Conclusion: Adversarial co-evolution is a powerful method for learning instrumental world models that drive agents toward greater strategic capabilities through continuous challenge generation.

Abstract: World models that infer and predict environmental dynamics are foundational
to embodied intelligence. However, their potential is often limited by the
finite complexity and implicit biases of hand-crafted training environments. To
develop truly generalizable and robust agents, we need environments that scale
in complexity alongside the agents learning within them. In this work, we
reframe the challenge of environment generation as the problem of learning a
goal-conditioned, generative world model. We propose a system where a
generative **Attacker** agent learns an implicit world model to synthesize
increasingly difficult challenges for a team of cooperative **Defender**
agents. The Attacker's objective is not passive prediction, but active,
goal-driven interaction: it models and generates world states (i.e.,
configurations of enemy units) specifically to exploit the Defenders'
weaknesses. Concurrently, the embodied Defender team learns a cooperative
policy to overcome these generated worlds. This co-evolutionary dynamic creates
a self-scaling curriculum where the world model continuously adapts to
challenge the decision-making policy of the agents, providing an effectively
infinite stream of novel and relevant training scenarios. We demonstrate that
this framework leads to the emergence of complex behaviors, such as the world
model learning to generate flanking and shielding formations, and the defenders
learning coordinated focus-fire and spreading tactics. Our findings position
adversarial co-evolution as a powerful method for learning instrumental world
models that drive agents toward greater strategic depth and robustness.

Motivation: To understand what fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient sparse-reward reinforcement learning, particularly through the lens of low-rank structure in reward matrices.

Method: Introduces Policy-Aware Matrix Completion (PAMC) framework that connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement learning via policy-dependent sampling analysis. Includes impossibility results, reward-free representation learning, distribution-free confidence sets, and robust completion guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluation across 100 domains shows exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to baselines, with only ~20% computational overhead.

Conclusion: Establishes structural reward learning as a promising new paradigm with implications for robotics, healthcare, and other safety-critical, sample-expensive applications.

Abstract: What fundamental properties of reward functions enable efficient
sparse-reward reinforcement learning? We address this question through the lens
of low-rank structure in reward matrices, showing that such structure induces a
sharp transition from exponential to polynomial sample complexity, the first
result of this kind for sparse-reward RL. We introduce Policy-Aware Matrix
Completion (PAMC), which connects matrix completion theory with reinforcement
learning via a new analysis of policy-dependent sampling. Our framework
provides: (i) impossibility results for general sparse reward observation, (ii)
reward-free representation learning from dynamics, (iii) distribution-free
confidence sets via conformal prediction, and (iv) robust completion guarantees
that degrade gracefully when low-rank structure is only approximate.
Empirically, we conduct a pre-registered evaluation across 100 systematically
sampled domains, finding exploitable structure in over half. PAMC improves
sample efficiency by factors between 1.6 and 2.1 compared to strong
exploration, structured, and representation-learning baselines, while adding
only about 20 percent computational overhead.These results establish structural

*Xiannan Huang,Shuhan Qiu,Jiayuan Du,Chao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ADAPT-Z is a novel online learning method for time series forecasting that addresses distribution shift by updating feature representations of latent factors instead of conventional parameter updates, and handles delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting through an adapter module with historical gradient information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting faces challenges from distribution shift, especially in online deployment where data arrives sequentially. Current methods focus on parameter selection and update strategies, but the authors argue that distribution shifts come from changes in underlying latent factors, making feature representation updates more effective.

Method: ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in Z-space) uses an adapter module that combines current feature representations with historical gradient information to enable robust parameter updates despite delayed feedback in multi-step forecasting scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments show that ADAPT-Z consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach of updating feature representations of latent factors rather than conventional parameters, combined with the ADAPT-Z adapter module for handling delayed feedback, provides an effective solution for online time series forecasting with distribution shifts.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is of significant importance across various domains.
However, it faces significant challenges due to distribution shift. This issue
becomes particularly pronounced in online deployment scenarios where data
arrives sequentially, requiring models to adapt continually to evolving
patterns. Current time series online learning methods focus on two main
aspects: selecting suitable parameters to update (e.g., final layer weights or
adapter modules) and devising suitable update strategies (e.g., using recent
batches, replay buffers, or averaged gradients). We challenge the conventional
parameter selection approach, proposing that distribution shifts stem from
changes in underlying latent factors influencing the data. Consequently,
updating the feature representations of these latent factors may be more
effective. To address the critical problem of delayed feedback in multi-step
forecasting (where true values arrive much later than predictions), we
introduce ADAPT-Z (Automatic Delta Adjustment via Persistent Tracking in
Z-space). ADAPT-Z utilizes an adapter module that leverages current feature
representations combined with historical gradient information to enable robust
parameter updates despite the delay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms standard base models without adaptation and
surpasses state-of-the-art online learning approaches across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: LiDAR-driven ML framework classifies indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories using optical reflectivity as proxy for EM scattering, enabling scatter-aware environment maps for mmWave/sub-THz networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable mmWave and sub-THz connectivity depends on surface reflections, but signals are vulnerable to blockage. Surface roughness determines scattering behavior (specular vs diffuse), which is crucial for network performance.

Method: Collected 78k+ points from 15 indoor materials, partitioned into 3cm patches. Extracted patch-level features (elevation angle, log-scaled intensity, max-to-mean ratio) and trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network classifiers.

Result: Ensemble tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) provided best accuracy-robustness trade-off, confirming LiDAR features capture roughness-induced scattering effects effectively.

Conclusion: Framework enables scatter-aware environment maps and digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and environment-aware connectivity in next-gen networks.

Abstract: Reliable connectivity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)
networks depends on reflections from surrounding surfaces, as high-frequency
signals are highly vulnerable to blockage. The scattering behavior of a surface
is determined not only by material permittivity but also by roughness, which
governs whether energy remains in the specular direction or is diffusely
scattered. This paper presents a LiDAR-driven machine learning framework for
classifying indoor surfaces into semi-specular and low-specular categories,
using optical reflectivity as a proxy for electromagnetic scattering behavior.
A dataset of over 78,000 points from 15 representative indoor materials was
collected and partitioned into 3 cm x 3 cm patches to enable classification
from partial views. Patch-level features capturing geometry and intensity,
including elevation angle, natural-log-scaled intensity, and max-to-mean ratio,
were extracted and used to train Random Forest, XGBoost, and neural network
classifiers. Results show that ensemble tree-based models consistently provide
the best trade-off between accuracy and robustness, confirming that
LiDAR-derived features capture roughness-induced scattering effects. The
proposed framework enables the generation of scatter aware environment maps and
digital twins, supporting adaptive beam management, blockage recovery, and
environment-aware connectivity in next-generation networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model for network partitioning, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and accuracy in community detection.

Method: Reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by decomposing global Hamiltonian into local utility functions. Prove convergence via better-response dynamics. Introduce two stability criteria: strict robustness requirement and relaxed utility function with resolution parameter.

Result: Local optimization converges in pseudo-polynomial time to equilibrium. Robust partitions yield higher accuracy in community tracking scenarios when bootstrapping Leiden algorithm with partial ground-truth information.

Conclusion: The game-theoretic framework provides efficient, robust, and accurate community detection with proven convergence properties and practical benefits in real-world applications.

Abstract: Community detection is one of the fundamental problems in data science which
consists of partitioning nodes into disjoint communities. We present a
game-theoretic perspective on the Constant Potts Model (CPM) for partitioning
networks into disjoint communities, emphasizing its efficiency, robustness, and
accuracy. Efficiency: We reinterpret CPM as a potential hedonic game by
decomposing its global Hamiltonian into local utility functions, where the
local utility gain of each agent matches the corresponding increase in global
utility. Leveraging this equivalence, we prove that local optimization of the
CPM objective via better-response dynamics converges in pseudo-polynomial time
to an equilibrium partition. Robustness: We introduce and relate two stability
criteria: a strict criterion based on a novel notion of robustness, requiring
nodes to simultaneously maximize neighbors and minimize non-neighbors within
communities, and a relaxed utility function based on a weighted sum of these
objectives, controlled by a resolution parameter. Accuracy: In community
tracking scenarios, where initial partitions are used to bootstrap the Leiden
algorithm with partial ground-truth information, our experiments reveal that
robust partitions yield higher accuracy in recovering ground-truth communities.

TL;DR: A lightweight BEV injection connector enhances MLLMs for V2I link prediction by providing spatial context, improving accuracy by up to 13.9% and up to 32.7% in adverse conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate V2I communication prediction is crucial for smooth handovers and reliable low-latency communication, but MLLMs lack 3D spatial understanding despite available vehicle sensor data.

Method: Proposes a plug-and-play BEV injection connector that constructs environment BEV from neighboring vehicles' sensing data and fuses it with ego vehicle input. Uses CARLA and MATLAB co-simulation to generate multimodal data and programmatically extract instructions.

Result: BEV injection framework consistently improved performance across all three V2I tasks (LoS/NLoS classification, link availability, blockage prediction), with up to 13.9% accuracy improvement and up to 32.7% gain in rainy/nighttime conditions.

Conclusion: The BEV injection approach effectively overcomes MLLMs' spatial limitations and demonstrates robustness in adverse conditions, making it valuable for reliable V2I communication systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,
confirming the robustness of the framework in adverse settings.

*Yang Chen,Xiao Lin,Bo Yan,Libo Zhang,Jiamou Liu,Neset Özkan Tan,Michael Witbrock*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a deep latent variable MFG model for inverse reinforcement learning that can handle heterogeneous agent objectives without prior knowledge of contexts or model modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL methods in mean field games assume agent homogeneity, limiting their ability to handle real-world scenarios with heterogeneous and unknown objectives in expert demonstrations.

Method: Developed a deep latent variable mean field game model and associated IRL method that can infer rewards from different but structurally similar tasks without requiring prior context knowledge.

Result: Experiments on simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem showed superior performance over state-of-the-art IRL methods in MFGs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitation of agent homogeneity in existing MFG IRL methods and successfully handles heterogeneous objectives in practical applications.

Abstract: Designing suitable reward functions for numerous interacting intelligent
agents is challenging in real-world applications. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) in mean field games (MFGs) offers a practical framework to infer
reward functions from expert demonstrations. While promising, the assumption of
agent homogeneity limits the capability of existing methods to handle
demonstrations with heterogeneous and unknown objectives, which are common in
practice. To this end, we propose a deep latent variable MFG model and an
associated IRL method. Critically, our method can infer rewards from different
yet structurally similar tasks without prior knowledge about underlying
contexts or modifying the MFG model itself. Our experiments, conducted on
simulated scenarios and a real-world spatial taxi-ride pricing problem,
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art IRL methods
in MFGs.

*Justin Kur,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel metric for selecting optimal data augmentation strategies in quantization-aware knowledge distillation that maximizes contextual mutual information while maintaining prediction accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing quantization-aware training and knowledge distillation methods focus on network output improvements but neglect the impact of input transformations like data augmentation, especially for low-precision models.

Method: Proposes a metric that evaluates data augmentation strategies based on their capacity to maximize contextual mutual information while ensuring predictions align with ground truth labels, enabling automatic DA selection with minimal training overhead.

Result: Extensive evaluations show that selecting DA strategies using the proposed metric significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD performance across various model architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective way to automatically select optimal data augmentation strategies for quantization-aware knowledge distillation, compatible with any existing QAT or KD algorithm and requiring minimal additional training cost.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) and Knowledge Distillation (KD) are
combined to achieve competitive performance in creating low-bit deep learning
models. Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized
models from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss
functions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input
transformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between
quantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the
question: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the
models with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs
according to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the
information not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the
predictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The
proposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training
overhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric
significantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MTS forecasting methods overlook hierarchical lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales, failing to capture complex lead-lag effects in real-world systems.

Method: Proposes MillGNN with two innovations: 1) scale-specific lead-lag graph learning using cross-correlation and dynamic decaying features, 2) hierarchical lead-lag message passing at multiple scales to capture intra- and inter-scale effects.

Result: Experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate superiority over 16 state-of-the-art methods for both long-term and short-term MTS forecasting.

Conclusion: MillGNN effectively captures comprehensive lead-lag dependencies at multiple scales, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,
failing to capture hierarchical lead-lag effects in complex systems. To this
end, we propose MillGNN, a novel \underline{g}raph \underline{n}eural
\underline{n}etwork-based method that learns \underline{m}ult\underline{i}ple
grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering
variate-wise and group-wise dynamics and decays. Specifically, MillGNN
introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-
and inter-scale lead-lag effects, which can capture multi-scale lead-lag
effects with a balance of comprehensiveness and efficiency. Experimental
results on 11 datasets demonstrate the superiority of MillGNN for long-term and
short-term MTS forecasting, compared with 16 state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide with significant healthcare costs, requiring non-invasive diagnostic approaches

Method: Multilayer perceptron neural network trained on 50 urinary peptide biomarkers selected via genetic algorithms, with SMOTE balancing and stratified validation

Result: Achieved 95.67% precision, sensitivity, and specificity, with AUC of 0.9748, F1-score of 0.9565, MCC of 0.9134, and Cohen's kappa of 0.9131

Conclusion: The model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease detection

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and
contributes significantly to annual healthcare expenditures. To develop a
non-invasive diagnostic approach, we designed a model based on a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) neural network, trained on 50 key urinary peptide biomarkers
selected via genetic algorithms. Treatment and control groups, each comprising
345 individuals, were balanced using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling
Technique (SMOTE). The neural network was trained using a stratified validation
strategy. Using a network with three hidden layers of 60 neurons each and an
output layer of two neurons, the model achieved a precision, sensitivity, and
specificity of 95.67 percent, with an F1-score of 0.9565. The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.9748 for both classes, while the Matthews correlation
coefficient (MCC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient were 0.9134 and 0.9131,
respectively, demonstrating its reliability in detecting CHD. These results
indicate that the model provides a highly accurate and robust non-invasive
diagnostic tool for coronary heart disease.

*Zhiyu Wang,Arian Jamasb,Mustafa Hajij,Alex Morehead,Luke Braithwaite,Pietro Liò*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Topotein is a topological deep learning framework that uses hierarchical protein representations and SE(3)-equivariant message passing to outperform existing methods on protein representation learning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein representation learning methods fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures, limiting their ability to understand structure-function relationships.

Method: Introduces Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) to represent proteins at multiple hierarchical levels (residues to secondary structures to complete proteins) and Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet) with SE(3)-equivariant message passing across hierarchical structures.

Result: TCPNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks across four protein representation learning tasks, particularly excelling in fold classification that requires understanding of secondary structure arrangements.

Conclusion: Hierarchical topological features are crucial for effective protein analysis, and the topological deep learning approach demonstrates superior performance in capturing multi-scale structural patterns.

Abstract: Protein representation learning (PRL) is crucial for understanding
structure-function relationships, yet current sequence- and graph-based methods
fail to capture the hierarchical organization inherent in protein structures.
We introduce Topotein, a comprehensive framework that applies topological deep
learning to PRL through the novel Protein Combinatorial Complex (PCC) and
Topology-Complete Perceptron Network (TCPNet). Our PCC represents proteins at
multiple hierarchical levels -- from residues to secondary structures to
complete proteins -- while preserving geometric information at each level.
TCPNet employs SE(3)-equivariant message passing across these hierarchical
structures, enabling more effective capture of multi-scale structural patterns.
Through extensive experiments on four PRL tasks, TCPNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art geometric graph neural networks. Our approach
demonstrates particular strength in tasks such as fold classification which
require understanding of secondary structure arrangements, validating the
importance of hierarchical topological features for protein analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the computational efficiency limits in online learning by investigating the minimum arithmetic operations required per round to learn arbitrary function families with finite mistakes.

Method: Proving general bounds on arithmetic operations per round needed for mistake-bounded learning, solving agnostic online learning problems with bandit feedback from prior research, and extending these results to operation-capped settings.

Result: Established fundamental bounds on computational requirements for mistake-bounded online learning and resolved open problems from Filmus et al (2024) and Geneson & Tang (2024).

Conclusion: The paper provides important theoretical foundations for understanding the computational complexity of online learning algorithms under operation constraints, with implications for efficient algorithm design.

Abstract: We investigate the mistake-bound model of online learning with caps on the
number of arithmetic operations per round. We prove general bounds on the
minimum number of arithmetic operations per round that are necessary to learn
an arbitrary family of functions with finitely many mistakes. We solve a

TL;DR: Formal verification of neural network robustness for satellite fault detection systems using Marabou tool to ensure high reliability under input perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite component failures are costly and difficult to address, requiring early detection through embedded AI systems that must operate with extremely high reliability.

Method: Employ the formal verification tool Marabou to verify local robustness of neural network models, quantifying how much input can be perturbed before output behavior becomes unstable.

Result: The approach improves trustworthiness of AI-based fault detection systems by ensuring performance stability under uncertainty and input variations.

Conclusion: Formal verification of neural network robustness is essential for dependable satellite fault detection systems, enabling earlier failure detection while maintaining high reliability standards.

Abstract: Failures in satellite components are costly and challenging to address, often
requiring significant human and material resources. Embedding a hybrid AI-based
system for fault detection directly in the satellite can greatly reduce this
burden by allowing earlier detection. However, such systems must operate with
extremely high reliability. To ensure this level of dependability, we employ
the formal verification tool Marabou to verify the local robustness of the
neural network models used in the AI-based algorithm. This tool allows us to
quantify how much a model's input can be perturbed before its output behavior
becomes unstable, thereby improving trustworthiness with respect to its
performance under uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for aligning ML models with clinical knowledge through constraints, showing improved alignment without performance loss in prostate cancer prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning models in healthcare often fail to capture clinically meaningful patterns that align with medical expertise, such as non-monotonic relationships that contradict clinical experience.

Method: Developed a reproducible framework incorporating clinical knowledge via constraints into ML models, conducted a prostate cancer outcome prediction case study with clinician surveys, and tested feedback-driven alignment through randomized experiments.

Result: Constrained models successfully aligned with clinical experiential learning without compromising performance. Larger differences between constrained and unconstrained models led to more apparent differences in clinical interpretation.

Conclusion: Clinical knowledge can be effectively incorporated into ML models through constraints, improving alignment with medical expertise while maintaining predictive performance, enabling better integration of AI in clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare
applications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models
do not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may
predict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and
survival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a
reproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model
behavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of
underspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome
prediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by
incorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into
the ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and
behavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning
the ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without
compromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we
further examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in
non-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized
experiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting
clinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the
difference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for
a patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.

*Ozgu Goksu,Nicolas Pugeault*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedQuad is a novel federated learning method that addresses data heterogeneity by optimizing intra-class variance and inter-class variance across clients, improving global model generalization through metric learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning faces challenges with data heterogeneity among clients, especially with limited dataset sizes and class imbalance, which negatively impacts global model generalization during aggregation.

Method: FedQuad explicitly optimizes smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across clients by minimizing distance between similar pairs and maximizing distance between negative pairs, effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space.

Result: The method demonstrates superior performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data distributions with many clients, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: Metric learning-based strategies are effective for addressing representational learning challenges in federated settings, with FedQuad providing a robust solution for data heterogeneity issues in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) provides decentralised model training, which
effectively tackles problems such as distributed data and privacy preservation.
However, the generalisation of global models frequently faces challenges from
data heterogeneity among clients. This challenge becomes even more pronounced
when datasets are limited in size and class imbalance. To address data
heterogeneity, we propose a novel method, \textit{FedQuad}, that explicitly
optimises smaller intra-class variance and larger inter-class variance across
clients, thereby decreasing the negative impact of model aggregation on the
global model over client representations. Our approach minimises the distance
between similar pairs while maximising the distance between negative pairs,
effectively disentangling client data in the shared feature space. We evaluate
our method on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets under various data
distributions and with many clients, demonstrating superior performance
compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of
metric learning-based strategies within both supervised and federated learning
paradigms, highlighting their efficacy in addressing representational learning
challenges in federated settings.

TL;DR: SP-CCI is a new conformal counterfactual inference method that uses synthetic data to reduce prediction interval width while maintaining coverage guarantees, addressing the conservativeness of existing CCI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conformal counterfactual inference methods provide marginal coverage but often produce overly conservative intervals, especially under treatment imbalance when counterfactual samples are scarce.

Method: SP-CCI augments the calibration set with synthetic counterfactual labels from a pre-trained counterfactual model, using risk-controlling prediction sets with a debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference to ensure validity.

Result: SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate importance weighting. Empirical results show consistent reduction in interval width compared to standard CCI.

Conclusion: SP-CCI provides a framework for more efficient counterfactual inference by leveraging synthetic data to reduce conservativeness while maintaining theoretical coverage guarantees.

Abstract: This work addresses the problem of constructing reliable prediction intervals
for individual counterfactual outcomes. Existing conformal counterfactual
inference (CCI) methods provide marginal coverage guarantees but often produce
overly conservative intervals, particularly under treatment imbalance when
counterfactual samples are scarce. We introduce synthetic data-powered CCI
(SP-CCI), a new framework that augments the calibration set with synthetic
counterfactual labels generated by a pre-trained counterfactual model. To
ensure validity, SP-CCI incorporates synthetic samples into a conformal
calibration procedure based on risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) with a
debiasing step informed by prediction-powered inference (PPI). We prove that
SP-CCI achieves tighter prediction intervals while preserving marginal
coverage, with theoretical guarantees under both exact and approximate
importance weighting. Empirical results on different datasets confirm that
SP-CCI consistently reduces interval width compared to standard CCI across all
settings.

TL;DR: This paper addresses fairness concerns in algorithmic recourse, linking fairness guarantees between recourse and classification, and introduces a novel social burden framework with practical algorithm MISOB that reduces social burden across groups while maintaining classifier accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging legislation mandates that classifiers must provide actionable recourse for negative decisions, but there are concerns about fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. The paper aims to address unfairness in algorithmic recourse.

Method: The authors provide a theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic recourse, formally link fairness guarantees between recourse and classification, and introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden. They develop a practical algorithm called MISOB that is broadly applicable under real-world conditions.

Result: Empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MISOB reduces the social burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The work provides a holistic theoretical foundation for understanding unfairness in algorithmic recourse and offers a practical solution (MISOB) that addresses social burden concerns while maintaining classification performance.

Abstract: Machine learning based predictions are increasingly used in sensitive
decision-making applications that directly affect our lives. This has led to
extensive research into ensuring the fairness of classifiers. Beyond just fair
classification, emerging legislation now mandates that when a classifier
delivers a negative decision, it must also offer actionable steps an individual
can take to reverse that outcome. This concept is known as algorithmic
recourse. Nevertheless, many researchers have expressed concerns about the
fairness guarantees within the recourse process itself. In this work, we
provide a holistic theoretical characterization of unfairness in algorithmic
recourse, formally linking fairness guarantees in recourse and classification,
and highlighting limitations of the standard equal cost paradigm. We then
introduce a novel fairness framework based on social burden, along with a
practical algorithm (MISOB), broadly applicable under real-world conditions.
Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MISOB reduces the social
burden across all groups without compromising overall classifier accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve machine learning performance through data generation, particularly for classification tasks, by creating synthetic tabular data that can enhance model training without requiring additional LLM training.

Method: Uses an agentic workflow with Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic, iterative data generation with feedback mechanisms. Incorporates external knowledge and evaluates across diverse datasets for quality assessment.

Result: TAGAL performs on par with state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms other training-free methods. Shows strong utility in downstream ML tasks when using synthetic data alone or combined with real data.

Conclusion: The agentic workflow approach demonstrates significant potential for LLM-based data generation, opening new directions for synthetic data creation methods without requiring additional model training.

Abstract: The generation of data is a common approach to improve the performance of
machine learning tasks, among which is the training of models for
classification. In this paper, we present TAGAL, a collection of methods able
to generate synthetic tabular data using an agentic workflow. The methods
leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for an automatic and iterative process
that uses feedback to improve the generated data without any further LLM
training. The use of LLMs also allows for the addition of external knowledge in
the generation process. We evaluate TAGAL across diverse datasets and different
aspects of quality for the generated data. We look at the utility of downstream
ML models, both by training classifiers on synthetic data only and by combining
real and synthetic data. Moreover, we compare the similarities between the real
and the generated data. We show that TAGAL is able to perform on par with
state-of-the-art approaches that require LLM training and generally outperforms
other training-free approaches. These findings highlight the potential of
agentic workflow and open new directions for LLM-based data generation methods.

TL;DR: AFA is a novel attention mechanism that incorporates a learnable dynamics model using linear SDEs, providing robust attention weights through maximum likelihood estimation while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to standard attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an attention mechanism that models input sequences as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential equation, providing a more robust and theoretically grounded alternative to standard dot-product attention.

Method: Models input sequence as discrete observations of a linear SDE with simultaneously diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances. Uses closed-form solution to differential Lyapunov equation to propagate pairwise uncertainties. Attention weights emerge as maximum likelihood solution with robust residual-based reweightings.

Result: Developed Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA) that maintains same computational and memory complexity as standard attention while providing a more robust attention mechanism based on linear SDE modeling.

Conclusion: AFA provides a theoretically sound attention mechanism that generalizes standard dot-product attention, recovering it as a special case in the limit of vanishing dynamics and process noise with small-angle approximation.

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Filter Attention (AFA), a novel attention mechanism
that incorporates a learnable dynamics model directly into the computation of
attention weights. Rather than comparing queries and keys directly, we model
the input sequence as discrete observations of a linear stochastic differential
equation (SDE). By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously
diagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a
closed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently
propagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally
arises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention
weights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated
pairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's
eigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and
memory complexity as standard attention. In the limit of vanishing dynamics and
process noise, and using a small-angle approximation, we recover ordinary
dot-product attention.

Conclusion: Speech-based self-supervised learning provides an efficient framework for advancing bioacoustic research, demonstrating strong transfer learning capabilities from speech to animal sound analysis.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models have demonstrated impressive performance in

TL;DR: This paper introduces two new membership inference attacks for time series forecasting models and shows they achieve strong performance, establishing new baselines for privacy risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Membership inference attacks have been extensively studied on classification models but remain largely unexplored for time series forecasting, creating a significant research gap.

Method: The authors introduce two attacks: (1) an adaptation of multivariate LiRA from classification to time series forecasting, and (2) a novel end-to-end learning approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. They benchmark these against adapted versions of other leading classification attacks.

Result: Forecasting models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks, with user-level attacks often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest performance in several settings. Vulnerability increases with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations.

Conclusion: Time series forecasting models are susceptible to membership inference attacks, and the proposed DTS and adapted LiRA methods establish new baselines for privacy risk assessment in this domain.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether specific data
were used to train a model. While extensively studied on classification models,
their impact on time series forecasting remains largely unexplored. We address
this gap by introducing two new attacks: (i) an adaptation of multivariate
LiRA, a state-of-the-art MIA originally developed for classification models, to
the time-series forecasting setting, and (ii) a novel end-to-end learning
approach called Deep Time Series (DTS) attack. We benchmark these methods
against adapted versions of other leading attacks from the classification
setting.
  We evaluate all attacks in realistic settings on the TUH-EEG and ELD
datasets, targeting two strong forecasting architectures, LSTM and the
state-of-the-art N-HiTS, under both record- and user-level threat models. Our
results show that forecasting models are vulnerable, with user-level attacks
often achieving perfect detection. The proposed methods achieve the strongest
performance in several settings, establishing new baselines for privacy risk
assessment in time series forecasting. Furthermore, vulnerability increases
with longer prediction horizons and smaller training populations, echoing
trends observed in large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address and extend the theoretical understanding of over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through Dirichlet energy analysis, particularly focusing on spectral conditions and practical implications.

Method: The authors provide theoretical analysis under mild spectral conditions (including Leaky-ReLU), extend results to spectral polynomial filters, and conduct experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification to study Dirichlet energy behavior.

Result: The paper demonstrates that Dirichlet energy decreases exponentially with depth under specified conditions, and experimental results show when Dirichlet energy increases, suggesting practical approaches to mitigate over-smoothing.

Conclusion: The analysis provides deeper theoretical insights into over-smoothing phenomena in GNNs and offers practical guidance (through edge deletion and weight amplification) for addressing this issue in real-world applications.

Abstract: We comment on Cai and Wang (2020, arXiv:2006.13318), who analyze
over-smoothing in GNNs via Dirichlet energy. We show that under mild spectral
conditions (including with Leaky-ReLU), the Dirichlet energy of node embeddings
decreases exponentially with depth; we further extend the result to spectral
polynomial filters and provide a short proof for the Leaky-ReLU case.
Experiments on edge deletion and weight amplification illustrate when Dirichlet
energy increases, hinting at practical ways to relieve over-smoothing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Set Block Decoding (SBD) accelerates autoregressive language model inference by combining next token prediction and masked token prediction to sample multiple future tokens in parallel, achieving 3-5x speedup without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive language models face high computational and memory costs during inference, particularly in the decoding stage, which limits practical deployment.

Method: SBD integrates standard next token prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single architecture, allowing parallel sampling of multiple non-consecutive future tokens using discrete diffusion solvers.

Result: Fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B with SBD achieves 3-5x reduction in forward passes while maintaining same performance as equivalent NTP training.

Conclusion: SBD provides a simple, flexible acceleration paradigm that requires no architectural changes, maintains KV-caching compatibility, and significantly speeds up generation without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Autoregressive next token prediction language models offer powerful
capabilities but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to the
high computational and memory costs of inference, particularly during the
decoding stage. We introduce Set Block Decoding (SBD), a simple and flexible
paradigm that accelerates generation by integrating standard next token
prediction (NTP) and masked token prediction (MATP) within a single
architecture. SBD allows the model to sample multiple, not necessarily
consecutive, future tokens in parallel, a key distinction from previous
acceleration methods. This flexibility allows the use of advanced solvers from
the discrete diffusion literature, offering significant speedups without
sacrificing accuracy. SBD requires no architectural changes or extra training
hyperparameters, maintains compatibility with exact KV-caching, and can be
implemented by fine-tuning existing next token prediction models. By
fine-tuning Llama-3.1 8B and Qwen-3 8B, we demonstrate that SBD enables a 3-5x
reduction in the number of forward passes required for generation while
achieving same performance as equivalent NTP training.

*Hao-Nan Shi,Ting-Ji Huang,Lu Han,De-Chuan Zhan,Han-Jia Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZooCast is a framework that intelligently combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) into a model zoo, using a unified embedding space to dynamically select the best model for each forecasting task without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different TSFMs excel at different temporal patterns, but no single model performs best universally. The authors aim to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple TSFMs for improved zero-shot forecasting.

Method: Proposes ZooCast with One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that creates a unified representation space where each model is represented by a single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for task-specific model selection.

Result: ZooCast demonstrates strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. It also seamlessly integrates new models with negligible overhead.

Conclusion: The framework successfully leverages complementary TSFM capabilities through intelligent model selection, achieving improved forecasting accuracy while maintaining efficiency and scalability for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly
advanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series
without task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no
single TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for
distinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take
advantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose
ZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.
ZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that
dynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key
innovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a
unified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a
single embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.
Experiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot
forecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM. In
real-world scenarios with sequential model releases, the framework seamlessly
adds new models for progressive accuracy gains with negligible overhead.

*Diede P. M. van der Hoorn,Alessio Arleo,Fernando V. Paulovich*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces precision and recall metrics to evaluate the relationship phase of dimensionality reduction, helping explain why expected cluster structures may be missing from visualizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DR quality metrics don't explain why expected cluster structures are missing from projections, and visual analytics solutions are time-consuming due to large hyperparameter spaces.

Method: Leverages a framework dividing DR into relationship and mapping phases, introduces supervised precision and recall metrics to evaluate how well modeled relationships align with expected cluster structures based on labels.

Result: The approach is illustrated using t-SNE and UMAP, validated through various usage scenarios, and shown to guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection artifacts, and determine if expected structure is captured.

Conclusion: The introduced metrics make the dimensionality reduction process faster and more reliable by providing insights into why expected structures may be missing from projections.

Abstract: Dimensionality Reduction (DR) is widely used for visualizing high-dimensional
data, often with the goal of revealing expected cluster structure. However,
such a structure may not always appear in the projections. Existing DR quality
metrics assess projection reliability (to some extent) or cluster structure
quality, but do not explain why expected structures are missing. Visual
Analytics solutions can help, but are often time-consuming due to the large
hyperparameter space. This paper addresses this problem by leveraging a recent
framework that divides the DR process into two phases: a relationship phase,
where similarity relationships are modeled, and a mapping phase, where the data
is projected accordingly. We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and
recall, to evaluate the relationship phase. These metrics quantify how well the
modeled relationships align with an expected cluster structure based on some
set of labels representing this structure. We illustrate their application
using t-SNE and UMAP, and validate the approach through various usage
scenarios. Our approach can guide hyperparameter tuning, uncover projection
artifacts, and determine if the expected structure is captured in the
relationships, making the DR process faster and more reliable.

### [204] [Rethinking the long-range dependency in Mamba/SSM and transformer models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04226)
*Cong Ma,Kayvan Najarian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Theoretical analysis shows SSMs have exponential decay in long-range dependency like RNNs, while transformers' attention offers more flexibility. A new SSM formulation is proposed to combine attention's flexibility with SSM efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically investigate and compare the long-range dependency modeling capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) and transformers, enabling systematic improvements in this aspect.

Method: Mathematically defined long-range dependency using derivatives of hidden states w.r.t. past inputs. Compared SSM and transformer capabilities, then proposed a new SSM formulation combining attention flexibility with SSM efficiency.

Result: SSMs exhibit exponential decay of long-range dependency with sequence length (similar to RNNs), while attention mechanism in transformers is more flexible and not constrained to exponential decay.

Conclusion: The new SSM formulation combines the flexibility of attention for long-range dependency with the computational efficiency of SSMs, proven stable under Gaussian input distribution.

Abstract: Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.

*Qifeng Tan,Shusen Yang,Xuebin Ren,Yikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified analytical framework for layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms in differentially private deep learning that reveals flaws in existing noise allocation strategies and proposes a SNR-consistent approach for better privacy-utility tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layer-wise noise injection methods lack rigorous theoretical grounding and often use heuristic strategies that either ignore inter-layer signal-to-noise ratio consistency or lead to inefficient privacy budget utilization.

Method: Proposed a SNR-consistent noise allocation strategy that systematically connects layer-wise noise injection with optimization objectives and privacy budget allocations, ensuring better signal preservation and efficient privacy budget use.

Result: Extensive experiments in centralized and federated learning settings show the method consistently outperforms existing allocation strategies and achieves better privacy-utility tradeoffs.

Conclusion: The framework provides diagnostic insights into prior methods and offers theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Layer-wise Gaussian mechanisms (LGM) enhance flexibility in differentially
private deep learning by injecting noise into partitioned gradient vectors.
However, existing methods often rely on heuristic noise allocation strategies,
lacking a rigorous understanding of their theoretical grounding in connecting
noise allocation to formal privacy-utility tradeoffs. In this paper, we present
a unified analytical framework that systematically connects layer-wise noise
injection strategies with their implicit optimization objectives and associated
privacy budget allocations. Our analysis reveals that several existing
approaches optimize ill-posed objectives -- either ignoring inter-layer
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) consistency or leading to inefficient use of the
privacy budget. In response, we propose a SNR-Consistent noise allocation
strategy that unifies both aspects, yielding a noise allocation scheme that
achieves better signal preservation and more efficient privacy budget
utilization. Extensive experiments in both centralized and federated learning
settings demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing
allocation strategies, achieving better privacy-utility tradeoffs. Our
framework not only offers diagnostic insights into prior methods but also
provides theoretical guidance for designing adaptive and effective noise
injection schemes in deep models.

Abstract: Background: Heart failure (HF) research is constrained by limited access to
large, shareable datasets due to privacy regulations and institutional
barriers. Synthetic data generation offers a promising solution to overcome
these challenges while preserving patient confidentiality. Methods: We
generated synthetic HF datasets from institutional data comprising 12,552
unique patients using five deep learning models: tabular variational

denoising diffusion probabilistic models (TabDDPM). We comprehensively
evaluated synthetic data utility through statistical similarity metrics,
survival prediction using machine learning and privacy assessments. Results:
SurvivalGAN and TabDDPM demonstrated high fidelity to the original dataset,
exhibiting similar variable distributions and survival curves after applying
histogram equalization. SurvivalGAN (C-indices: 0.71-0.76) and TVAE (C-indices:
0.73-0.76) achieved the strongest performance in survival prediction
evaluation, closely matched real data performance (C-indices: 0.73-0.76).
Privacy evaluation confirmed protection against re-identification attacks.
Conclusions: Deep learning-based synthetic data generation can produce
high-fidelity, privacy-preserving HF datasets suitable for research
applications. This publicly available synthetic dataset addresses critical data
sharing barriers and provides a valuable resource for advancing HF research and
predictive modeling.

*Idan Shenfeld,Jyothish Pari,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL fine-tuning preserves prior knowledge better than SFT due to smaller distributional shift, measured by KL-divergence from base model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why reinforcement learning fine-tuning preserves model capabilities better than supervised fine-tuning despite similar task performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of distributional shift using KL-divergence, experimental validation with large language models and robotic foundation models, and comparison of on-policy RL vs SFT convergence properties.

Result: RL fine-tuning maintains significantly better preservation of prior knowledge, with the degree of forgetting determined by KL-divergence between fine-tuned and base policies. On-policy RL converges to KL-minimal solutions while SFT can diverge arbitrarily.

Conclusion: On-policy RL updates inherently prefer solutions closest to the original model (RL's Razor principle), making RL superior for preserving model capabilities during fine-tuning.

Abstract: Comparison of fine-tuning models with reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) reveals that, despite similar performance at a new
task, RL preserves prior knowledge and capabilities significantly better. We
find that the degree of forgetting is determined by the distributional shift,
measured as the KL-divergence between the fine-tuned and base policy evaluated
on the new task. Our analysis reveals that on-policy RL is implicitly biased
towards KL-minimal solutions among the many that solve the new task, whereas
SFT can converge to distributions arbitrarily far from the base model. We
validate these findings through experiments with large language models and
robotic foundation models and further provide theoretical justification for why
on-policy RL updates lead to a smaller KL change. We term this principle
$\textit{RL's Razor}$: among all ways to solve a new task, RL prefers those
closest in KL to the original model.

### [208] [An Interactive Framework for Finding the Optimal Trade-off in Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04290)
*Yaohong Yang,Aki Rehn,Sammie Katt,Antti Honkela,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel interactive multi-objective optimization approach for differentially private ML that directly models the Pareto front shape and uses more informative preference learning through hypothetical trade-off curves, achieving better efficiency than standard methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard interactive MOO methods are inefficient for DP problems because they fail to leverage the unique structure where Pareto optimal points can be generated by maximizing accuracy for fixed privacy levels, and they use simple pairwise comparisons that require excessive user interaction.

Method: Theoretically derive the shape of the privacy-accuracy trade-off to directly model the Pareto front efficiently. Replace pairwise comparisons with more informative interactions by presenting users with hypothetical trade-off curves and asking them to select preferred trade-offs.

Result: Experiments on differentially private logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets show the method converges to optimal privacy-accuracy trade-offs with significantly less computational cost and user interaction compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages the structural properties of DP problems to achieve more efficient multi-objective optimization, reducing both computational burden and user interaction requirements while maintaining optimal performance in privacy-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is the standard for privacy-preserving analysis,
and introduces a fundamental trade-off between privacy guarantees and model
performance. Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first
discovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a
decision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive
MOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with
generic surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is
inefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:
a point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy
for a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the
shape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front
directly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we
replace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In
particular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them
to pick their preferred trade-off. Our experiments on differentially private
logistic regression and deep transfer learning across six real-world datasets
show that our method converges to the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off with
significantly less computational cost and user interaction than baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machine learning methods often fail in real-world deployment, especially in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines, which hinders adoption in critical domains like medical diagnosis where they could provide significant benefits if safely deployed.

Method: The authors introduce causal and statistical structures that induce failure in machine learning for image analysis, highlighting two specific problems (no fair lunch and subgroup separability), analyze why current fair representation learning methods fail to solve them, and propose potential solutions.

Result: The paper identifies and characterizes two previously overlooked problems that cause ML failures in real-world applications, demonstrating the limitations of current fair representation learning approaches.

Conclusion: The field needs new approaches to address the no fair lunch and subgroup separability problems to enable safe deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains like medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Machine learning methods often fail when deployed in the real world. Worse
still, they fail in high-stakes situations and across socially sensitive lines.
These issues have a chilling effect on the adoption of machine learning methods
in settings such as medical diagnosis, where they are arguably best-placed to
provide benefits if safely deployed. In this primer, we introduce the causal
and statistical structures which induce failure in machine learning methods for
image analysis. We highlight two previously overlooked problems, which we call
the \textit{no fair lunch} problem and the \textit{subgroup separability}
problem. We elucidate why today's fair representation learning methods fail to
adequately solve them and propose potential paths forward for the field.

TL;DR: AT-UCB algorithm leverages causal abstraction theory to explore cheap coarse-grained CMAB instances first, then applies UCB on restricted optimal actions, reducing cumulative regret compared to classical UCB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world decision problems can be encoded as causal multi-armed bandits at different abstraction levels, but existing methods don't efficiently exploit shared information between these levels.

Method: Proposes AT-UCB algorithm that uses causal abstraction theory to explore in cheap-to-simulate coarse-grained CMAB instances, then applies traditional UCB on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions.

Result: Significant reductions in cumulative regret compared to classical UCB algorithm, demonstrated both theoretically through novel regret bounds and empirically using epidemiological simulators with varying resolution.

Conclusion: AT-UCB provides an effective methodology for exploiting information and computational advantages across different abstraction levels in causal multi-armed bandit problems.

Abstract: Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.

TL;DR: Proposes a data-driven behavioral model to analyze energy usage patterns on US Army installations for climate resilience planning and assessing impacts of disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: US Army installations face climate change threats and rely on vulnerable commercial energy/water sources, requiring resilience measures to protect critical mission-supporting facilities.

Method: Develops behavioral models that analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal energy usage data from non-residential buildings, using open access data due to Army data constraints.

Result: Creates energy usage behavior profiles that enable baseline assessment of disruption impacts and benchmarking for future resilience measures.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology provides a framework for understanding installation energy behavior to enhance climate resilience and protect critical military infrastructure.

Abstract: Due to the threat of changing climate and extreme weather events, the
infrastructure of the United States Army installations is at risk. More than
ever, climate resilience measures are needed to protect facility assets that
support critical missions and help generate readiness. As most of the Army
installations within the continental United States rely on commercial energy
and water sources, resilience to the vulnerabilities within independent energy
resources (electricity grids, natural gas pipelines, etc) along with a baseline
understanding of energy usage within installations must be determined. This
paper will propose a data-driven behavioral model to determine behavior
profiles of energy usage on installations. These profiles will be used 1) to
create a baseline assessment of the impact of unexpected disruptions on energy
systems and 2) to benchmark future resiliency measures. In this methodology,
individual building behavior will be represented with models that can
accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data collected from energy
usage of non-residential buildings. Due to the nature of Army installation
energy usage data, similarly structured open access data will be used to
illustrate this methodology.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SST-iTransformer for parking availability prediction, using multi-source transportation data and self-supervised learning to achieve state-of-the-art results with improved spatio-temporal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address urban parking crisis by improving parking availability prediction through better modeling of spatio-temporal dependencies and leveraging multi-source transportation data.

Method: Uses K-means clustering to create parking cluster zones, integrates traffic demand from multiple modes (metro, bus, ride-hailing, taxi), and enhances iTransformer with self-supervised learning and dual-branch attention mechanism (Series Attention for temporal dependencies, Channel Attention for cross-variate interactions).

Result: Outperforms baseline models (Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, iTransformer) with lowest MSE and competitive MAE. Ride-hailing data provides largest performance gains, followed by taxi data, while fixed-route transit features contribute marginally.

Conclusion: SST-iTransformer effectively captures complex spatio-temporal dependencies for parking prediction, with multi-source data integration and spatial correlation modeling being crucial for performance. The approach demonstrates practical value for urban planning and management.

Abstract: The rapid growth of private car ownership has worsened the urban parking
predicament, underscoring the need for accurate and effective parking
availability prediction to support urban planning and management. To address
key limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting
multi-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a
novel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means
clustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and
integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes
(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted
parking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates
masking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal
representation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention
mechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via
patching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions
through inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from
Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep
learning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and
iTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean
squared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive
ablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different
data sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance
gains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)
contribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that
excluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to
substantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling
spatial dependencies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Novel active learning strategies that reduce bias between experimental rounds by leveraging bias-variance tradeoff and heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, with a cobias-covariance relationship for batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world experiments often have heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty that can be correlated in batched settings, requiring better active learning approaches to handle this uncertainty.

Method: Proposes active learning strategies based on bias-variance tradeoff to reduce bias between rounds, and introduces a cobias-covariance relationship with eigendecomposition for batching historical data.

Result: The difference-based method using cobias-covariance relationship outperforms canonical methods like BALD and Least Confidence in batched settings with quadratic estimators.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively handles heteroskedastic and correlated uncertainty in experimental settings, providing superior performance over existing active learning methods through bias reduction and efficient batching strategies.

Abstract: Real-world experimental scenarios are characterized by the presence of
heteroskedastic aleatoric uncertainty, and this uncertainty can be correlated
in batched settings. The bias--variance tradeoff can be used to write the
expected mean squared error between a model distribution and a ground-truth
random variable as the sum of an epistemic uncertainty term, the bias squared,
and an aleatoric uncertainty term. We leverage this relationship to propose
novel active learning strategies that directly reduce the bias between
experimental rounds, considering model systems both with and without noise.
Finally, we investigate methods to leverage historical data in a quadratic
manner through the use of a novel cobias--covariance relationship, which
naturally proposes a mechanism for batching through an eigendecomposition
strategy. When our difference-based method leveraging the cobias--covariance
relationship is utilized in a batched setting (with a quadratic estimator), we
outperform a number of canonical methods including BALD and Least Confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caching improves LLM inference efficiency but becomes a major memory bottleneck as sequence length increases, requiring better memory management solutions.

Method: Proposes PagedEviction, a fine-grained structured KV cache pruning strategy with block-wise eviction algorithm designed for paged memory layouts, seamlessly integrating with vLLM's PagedAttention without modifying CUDA kernels.

Result: Evaluation on Llama models (3.1-8B, 3.2-1B, 3.2-3B) using LongBench benchmark shows improved memory usage with better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

Conclusion: PagedEviction effectively addresses KV cache memory bottlenecks through structured pruning while maintaining performance, providing a practical solution for efficient long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.

Result: TiM with 865M parameters surpasses SD3.5 (8B) and FLUX.1 (12B) across all step counts, shows monotonic quality improvement with more steps, and achieves exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

Conclusion: TiM provides a novel generative paradigm that successfully bridges the gap between efficiency and quality, offering flexible sampling strategies with superior performance compared to larger models.

Abstract: A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion
models achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,
while efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality
ceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from
restrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal
dynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by
introducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically
defines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a
novel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to
arbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory
from single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having
only 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing
leading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across
all evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,
TiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget
increases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM
delivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.

### [216] [IPA: An Information-Preserving Input Projection Framework for Efficient Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04398)
*Yuan Yin,Shashanka Venkataramanan,Tuan-Hung Vu,Andrei Bursuc,Matthieu Cord*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IPA improves LoRA by replacing random down-projection with feature-aware compression that preserves key information, achieving better performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA's random initialization of down-projection discards useful information and becomes a performance bottleneck, as it changes little during training while up-projection does most adaptation work.

Method: Proposes IPA framework that uses feature-aware projections to preserve information in reduced hidden space. Uses algorithms approximating top principal components for efficient projector pretraining with minimal inference overhead.

Result: Consistently outperforms LoRA and DoRA across language and vision benchmarks: +1.5 points average accuracy on commonsense reasoning, +2.3 points on VTAB-1k. Matches full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable parameters when projection is frozen.

Conclusion: IPA provides a more effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach by addressing LoRA's information loss in down-projection through feature-aware compression, delivering superior performance with improved parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, reduce
adaptation cost by injecting low-rank updates into pretrained weights. However,
LoRA's down-projection is randomly initialized and data-agnostic, discarding
potentially useful information. Prior analyses show that this projection
changes little during training, while the up-projection carries most of the
adaptation, making the random input compression a performance bottleneck. We
propose IPA, a feature-aware projection framework that explicitly preserves
information in the reduced hidden space. In the linear case, we instantiate IPA
with algorithms approximating top principal components, enabling efficient
projector pretraining with negligible inference overhead. Across language and
vision benchmarks, IPA consistently improves over LoRA and DoRA, achieving on
average 1.5 points higher accuracy on commonsense reasoning and 2.3 points on
VTAB-1k, while matching full LoRA performance with roughly half the trainable
parameters when the projection is frozen.

*Wenrui Li,Qinghao Zhang,Xiaowo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCL is an unsupervised framework that jointly infers latent clusters and their causal structures from mixed-type observational data without requiring temporal ordering, interventions, or prior knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack causal awareness and struggle with modeling heterogeneity, confounding, and observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations.

Method: HCL introduces an equivalent representation encoding structural heterogeneity and confounding, uses a bi-directional iterative strategy to refine causal clustering and structure learning, and employs self-supervised regularization to balance cross-cluster universality and specificity.

Result: Theoretically, HCL shows identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild conditions. Empirically, it achieves superior performance in clustering and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms in real-world single-cell perturbation data.

Conclusion: HCL enables convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns and demonstrates utility for discovering mechanism-level causal heterogeneity in scientific domains like biology and medicine.

Abstract: Understanding causal heterogeneity is essential for scientific discovery in
domains such as biology and medicine. However, existing methods lack causal
awareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and
observational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty
distinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose
an unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering
with Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers
latent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type
observational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,
interventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and
sufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that
encodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a
bi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and
structure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance
cross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable
convergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,
we show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild
conditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering
and structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms
in real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for
discovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified framework connects RL and SFT approaches through a single optimization process with a Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, leading to Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) that dynamically selects training signals for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between online (RL) and offline (SFT) training data approaches, showing they are instances of a single optimization process rather than contradictory methods.

Method: Derived Unified Policy Gradient Estimator with four interchangeable parts, then developed Hybrid Post-Training (HPT) algorithm that dynamically selects training signals from both demonstration data and exploration.

Result: HPT consistently outperforms strong baselines across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, working well across models of varying scales and families.

Conclusion: RL and SFT approaches are unified under a single theoretical framework, and the proposed HPT algorithm effectively combines both approaches for superior post-training performance.

Abstract: Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language
models: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or
other-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by
approaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
respectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in
contradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a
Unified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide
spectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective
under different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance
tradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable
parts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,
and likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose
Hybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different
training signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of
demonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning
patterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the
effectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six
mathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT
consistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and
families.

*Pradeep Singh,Balasubramanian Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper provides a systems-theoretic framework for Echo State Networks (ESNs) by recasting them as state-space models, establishing stability conditions, developing linearization and kernel analysis methods, and proposing improved training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move ESN design from heuristic approaches to first principles by establishing a unified systems-theoretic foundation that connects reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized state-space models.

Method: Recast ESNs as state-space models, derive verifiable stability conditions, develop small-signal linearizations and lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions, and propose Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning with EM for hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Established theoretical foundations for ESN stability, provided frequency-domain characterizations of memory spectra, and developed methods for when ESNs emulate structured SSM kernels.

Conclusion: The systems-theoretic perspective provides rigorous foundations for ESN design, enabling principled stability analysis, interpretable memory characterization, and improved training methods that bridge reservoir computing with classical system identification.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are typically presented as efficient,
readout-trained recurrent models, yet their dynamics and design are often
guided by heuristics rather than first principles. We recast ESNs explicitly as
state-space models (SSMs), providing a unified systems-theoretic account that
links reservoir computing with classical identification and modern kernelized
SSMs. First, we show that the echo-state property is an instance of
input-to-state stability for a contractive nonlinear SSM and derive verifiable
conditions in terms of leak, spectral scaling, and activation Lipschitz
constants. Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal
linearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and
memory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render
the ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and
convolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain
characterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured
SSM kernels. Third, we cast teacher forcing as state estimation and propose
Kalman/EKF-assisted readout learning, together with EM for hyperparameters
(leak, spectral radius, process/measurement noise) and a hybrid subspace
procedure for spectral shaping under contraction constraints.

*Nikolay Kartashev,Ivan Rubachev,Artem Babenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper explains that recent tabular deep learning methods succeed because they implicitly manage data uncertainty, and uses this insight to develop better numerical feature embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why recent tabular deep learning techniques perform well in practice despite lacking clear theoretical explanations for their success.

Method: Analyzes how beneficial design choices in tabular DL (numerical feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models, advanced ensembling) implicitly handle data uncertainty, and develops improved numerical feature embeddings based on these insights.

Result: Provides a unifying explanation for tabular DL performance improvements and develops more effective numerical feature embeddings as a practical outcome.

Conclusion: The data-uncertainty perspective offers foundational understanding of modern tabular methods, enables concrete advancements in existing techniques, and outlines future research directions for tabular deep learning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in tabular deep learning have demonstrated exceptional
practical performance, yet the field often lacks a clear understanding of why
these techniques actually succeed. To address this gap, our paper highlights
the importance of the concept of data uncertainty for explaining the
effectiveness of the recent tabular DL methods. In particular, we reveal that
the success of many beneficial design choices in tabular DL, such as numerical
feature embeddings, retrieval-augmented models and advanced ensembling
strategies, can be largely attributed to their implicit mechanisms for managing
high data uncertainty. By dissecting these mechanisms, we provide a unifying
understanding of the recent performance improvements. Furthermore, the insights
derived from this data-uncertainty perspective directly allowed us to develop
more effective numerical feature embeddings as an immediate practical outcome
of our analysis. Overall, our work paves the way to foundational understanding
of the benefits introduced by modern tabular methods that results in the
concrete advancements of existing techniques and outlines future research
directions for tabular DL.

TL;DR: Delta Activations method represents finetuned LLMs as vector embeddings by measuring activation shifts from base models, enabling effective clustering by domain/task and showing robustness across finetuning settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of open-source LLMs adapted to specific tasks has created challenges in navigating and understanding these models due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.

Method: Measure shifts in internal activations of finetuned models relative to a base model to create vector embeddings that capture model characteristics.

Result: Delta Activations enable effective clustering by domain and task, show robustness across finetuning settings, exhibit additive properties with mixed datasets, and can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning.

Conclusion: Delta Activations provide a structured way to represent and understand finetuned models, facilitating model reuse, selection, and merging in the open-source LLM ecosystem.

Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled
the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to
specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models
remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.
We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as
vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to
a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and
task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also
demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and
exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,
we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and
further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta
Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.

*Cyrus Cousins,Vijay Keswani,Vincent Conitzer,Hoda Heidari,Jana Schaich Borg,Walter Sinnott-Armstrong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes an axiomatic approach to learn cognitively faithful decision models from pairwise comparisons that better capture human heuristic processes, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard preference elicitation methods fail to capture true human cognitive processes like heuristics, resulting in models that don't align with actual decision-making and lack generalization capabilities.

Method: An axiomatic approach defining models where individual features are first processed and compared across alternatives, then aggregated via fixed rules like Bradley-Terry, ensuring realistic representation of human decision processes.

Result: The proposed models match or surpass prior models' accuracy in human pairwise decision-making, demonstrated effectively in a kidney allocation task with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The structured processing approach provides more cognitively faithful and interpretable models of human decision-making that better capture heuristic processes compared to traditional elicitation methods.

Abstract: Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with
the explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal
values. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and
practitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then
used to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in
such elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of
human decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify
information associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned
from people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and
can not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other
decision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic
approach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise
comparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive
processes that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work
characterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class
of models in which individual features are first processed and compared across
alternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed
rule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information
ensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent
underlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this
modeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in
a kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass
the accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.

TL;DR: ChronoGraph is a novel dataset for multivariate time series forecasting with explicit service dependency graphs and real incident annotations from production microservices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the combination of multivariate time series, machine-readable dependency graphs, and real-world anomaly labels needed for realistic microservice system evaluation.

Method: Built from real production microservices with nodes as services emitting performance metrics and directed edges encoding service dependencies, providing expert-annotated incident windows.

Result: Provides baseline results for forecasting models, pretrained time-series foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors on this realistic benchmark.

Conclusion: ChronoGraph offers a comprehensive benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware evaluation in microservice environments, addressing limitations of existing datasets.

Abstract: We present ChronoGraph, a graph-structured multivariate time series
forecasting dataset built from real-world production microservices. Each node
is a service that emits a multivariate stream of system-level performance
metrics, capturing CPU, memory, and network usage patterns, while directed
edges encode dependencies between services. The primary task is forecasting
future values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph
provides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling
evaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness
during operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial
control systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely
combines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable
dependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We
report baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series
foundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a
realistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware
evaluation in microservice systems.

*Chatipat Lorpaiboon,Jonathan Weare,Aaron R. Dinner*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: New method for estimating committor probabilities and transition rates that is unbiased at any lag time, unlike existing approaches that only work for single time steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing committor estimation methods from trajectory data are biased when using practical lag times, as they only minimize correctly for single time steps.

Method: Introduced an alternative expression for transition rate that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time, with numerical tests on benchmark systems and error decomposition analysis.

Result: Numerical tests show the new committor and transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to lag time choice compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides more robust committor estimation and transition rate calculation that works across different lag times, with connections to variational approaches and improved numerical stability.

Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability
that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be
estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition
rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is
minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step,
resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an
alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag
time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and
resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of
lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate
the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics
based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical
considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

Conclusion: The proposed divergence-kernel formula and pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm provide effective tools for computing linear responses in random dynamical systems, enabling applications including diffusion generative modeling.

Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the linear response
(parameter-derivative of marginal or stationary distributions) of random
dynamical systems, and formally pass to the continuous-time limit. Our formula
works for multiplicative and parameterized noise over any period of time; it

Motivation: To develop a PDE solving method that eliminates the need for computing derivatives of the solution neural network, making it particularly suitable for complex second-order PDEs like Fokker-Planck equations.

Result: The method provides an effective approach for solving second-order elliptic and parabolic PDEs without requiring derivatives of the neural network solution.

Conclusion: ARDO offers a novel derivative-free deep learning framework that is particularly well-suited for Fokker-Planck type PDEs and related problems.

Abstract: We propose ARDO method for solving PDEs and PDE-related problems with deep

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Antimicrobial resistance poses significant public health and economic challenges, reducing antibiotic effectiveness and increasing treatment costs for infections like campylobacteriosis.

Method: Used machine learning (Random Forest with bootstrap resampling) on whole-genome sequencing data and epidemiological metadata from PubMLST and UK surveillance databases (2001-2017). Analyzed gyrA mutations and tet(O) gene for resistance. Employed time-series forecasting models (SARIMA, SIR, Prophet) for future predictions.

Result: Achieved 74% accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Forecasted campylobacteriosis cases potentially exceeding 130 per 100,000 people by 2050. Predicted sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing fluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates machine learning's effectiveness in predicting antimicrobial resistance trends and economic impacts, highlighting the urgent need for intervention strategies to mitigate rising healthcare costs and treatment challenges.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic
challenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.
This study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data
from the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity
(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by
the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns
in Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK
from 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,
epidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance
determinants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We
investigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene
for tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with
bootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%
accuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,
SIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially
exceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden
projected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced
Random Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by
incorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend
modeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing

TL;DR: Systematic study of enhancement filtering techniques in neural video compression, achieving 7.71% bit rate reduction through adaptive in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural video compression efficiency by systematically exploring enhancement filtering techniques that can mitigate error propagation and refine reconstructed frame quality.

Method: Categorizes enhancement filtering into in-loop contextual filtering (refines temporal context, mitigates error propagation) and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement (improves frame quality). Introduces adaptive coding decision strategy to dynamically apply filtering during encoding.

Result: Achieves 7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancement filtering approach provides significant coding efficiency improvements and represents the first systematic study of such techniques in conditional-based neural video compression.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in
neural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into
in-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based
on whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.
In-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error
propagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the
current and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering
throughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding
decision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during
encoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to
refine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective
improvement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of
conditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a
7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,
validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: EHVC is an efficient hierarchical neural video codec that addresses reference-quality mismatch through hierarchical multi-reference scheme, uses lookahead strategy for better quality structure, and employs layer-wise quality scale with random quality training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural video codecs show improved efficiency but lack proper alignment between reference structures and hierarchical quality structures, with room for optimization in quality structure design.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Hierarchical multi-reference scheme aligning reference and quality structures 2) Lookahead strategy using encoder-side context from future frames 3) Layer-wise quality scale with random quality training for stability

Result: EHVC achieves significantly superior performance compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs.

Conclusion: The proposed EHVC codec successfully addresses reference-quality mismatch and optimizes hierarchical quality structure, demonstrating substantial improvements in neural video coding efficiency.

Abstract: Neural video codecs (NVCs), leveraging the power of end-to-end learning, have
demonstrated remarkable coding efficiency improvements over traditional video
codecs. Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in
NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,
less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which
fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In
addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the
hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose
EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key
innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on
traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,
thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to
utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality
structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy
to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC
achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs. Code

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance across all metrics, with new benchmark dataset created for comprehensive audio query correction evaluation.

Conclusion: CTD method effectively corrects ASR transcription errors in speech queries, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with new evaluation benchmark.

Abstract: Query spelling correction is an important function of modern search engines
since it effectively helps users express their intentions clearly. With the
growing popularity of speech search driven by Automated Speech Recognition
(ASR) systems, this paper introduces a novel method named Contextualized Token
Discrimination (CTD) to conduct effective speech query correction. In CTD, we
first employ BERT to generate token-level contextualized representations and
then construct a composition layer to enhance semantic information. Finally, we
produce the correct query according to the aggregated token representation,
correcting the incorrect tokens by comparing the original token representations
and the contextualized representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method across all metrics, and we further
present a new benchmark dataset with erroneous ASR transcriptions to offer
comprehensive evaluations for audio query correction.

### [231] [AUDETER: A Large-scale Dataset for Deepfake Audio Detection in Open Worlds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04345)
*Qizhou Wang,Hanxun Huang,Guansong Pang,Sarah Erfani,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AUDETER is a large-scale deepfake audio dataset with 4,500+ hours of synthetic audio from 11 TTS models and 10 vocoders, addressing domain shift issues in deepfake detection and enabling 44-52% error reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods struggle with real-world reliability due to domain shift between training and test samples, and existing datasets lack diverse, up-to-date audio samples for both real and deepfake categories.

Method: Created AUDETER dataset with over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio (3 million clips) generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10 vocoders, providing comprehensive coverage of TTS/vocoder patterns for robust model training.

Result: SOTA methods trained on existing datasets fail to generalize to novel deepfake samples and have high false positive rates, but when trained on AUDETER achieve 44.1-51.6% error reduction with only 4.17% error rate on cross-domain samples.

Conclusion: AUDETER enables highly generalized deepfake detection performance, significantly reducing detection errors and paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors that work effectively in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Speech generation systems can produce remarkably realistic vocalisations that
are often indistinguishable from human speech, posing significant authenticity
challenges. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,
their effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the
domain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human
speech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately
addressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges
with diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To
fill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,
highly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust
development of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of
over 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10
vocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio
clips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive
experiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
trained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio
samples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,
underscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods
trained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and
significantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error
rate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild
dataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.
AUDETER is available on GitHub.

### [232] [Hypothesis Selection: A High Probability Conundrum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03734)
*Anders Aamand,Maryam Aliakbarpour,Justin Y. Chen,Sandeep Silwal*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Improved time complexity for hypothesis selection from O(n/(δ³ε³)) to O(n/(δε²)) while maintaining optimal sample complexity and approximation factor C=3. Also studied three alternative settings: expected distance optimization, known OPT case, and preprocessing scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Key aspects of hypothesis selection problem remained unresolved despite decades of work, including optimal running time for algorithms achieving optimal sample complexity and best approximation factor. Previous state-of-the-art had sub-optimal parameter dependence.

Method: Developed improved algorithms for hypothesis selection with reduced time complexity. Studied three alternative settings: expected distance optimization (settled optimal approximation factor), known OPT case (achieved C=3 with optimal sample complexity), and preprocessing scenarios (enabled subquadratic runtime).

Result: Achieved time complexity of O(n/(δε²)) compared to previous O(n/(δ³ε³)), significantly reducing dependence on confidence and error parameters. Resolved open questions in alternative settings with optimal approximation factors and improved runtimes.

Conclusion: The work provides significant improvements in time complexity for hypothesis selection while maintaining optimal performance guarantees, and resolves several longstanding open problems in alternative problem settings.

Abstract: In the hypothesis selection problem, we are given a finite set of candidate
distributions (hypotheses), $\mathcal{H} = \{H_1, \ldots, H_n\}$, and samples
from an unknown distribution $P$. Our goal is to find a hypothesis $H_i$ whose
total variation distance to $P$ is comparable to that of the nearest hypothesis
in $\mathcal{H}$. If the minimum distance is $\mathsf{OPT}$, we aim to output
an $H_i$ such that, with probability at least $1-\delta$, its total variation
distance to $P$ is at most $C \cdot \mathsf{OPT} + \varepsilon$.
  Despite decades of work, key aspects of this problem remain unresolved,
including the optimal running time for algorithms that achieve the optimal
sample complexity and best possible approximation factor of $C=3$. The previous
state-of-the-art result [Aliakbarpour, Bun, Smith, NeurIPS 2024] provided a
nearly linear in $n$ time algorithm but with a sub-optimal dependence on the
other parameters, running in $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta^3\varepsilon^3))$ time. We
improve this time complexity to $\tilde{O}(n/(\delta \varepsilon^2))$,
significantly reducing the dependence on the confidence and error parameters.
  Furthermore, we study hypothesis selection in three alternative settings,
resolving or making progress on several open questions from prior works. (1) We
settle the optimal approximation factor when bounding the \textit{expected
distance} of the output hypothesis, rather than its high-probability
performance. (2) Assuming the numerical value of \textit{$\mathsf{OPT}$ is
known} in advance, we present an algorithm obtaining $C=3$ and runtime
$\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ with the optimal sample complexity and succeeding
with high probability in $n$. (3) Allowing polynomial \textit{preprocessing}
step on the hypothesis class $\mathcal{H}$ before observing samples, we present
an algorithm with $C=3$ and subquadratic runtime which succeeds with high
probability in $n$.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: MatterVial is a hybrid ML framework that combines traditional feature-based models with deep learning by integrating latent representations from multiple pretrained GNNs and symbolic regression features, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art GNNs while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the chemical transparency of traditional feature-based models and the predictive power of deep learning architectures in materials science, creating a high-performance yet interpretable framework.

Method: Integrates latent representations from diverse pretrained GNN models (MEGNet, ROOST, ORB) with GNN-approximated descriptors and symbolic regression features, augmenting feature-based model MODNet on Matbench tasks with an interpretability module using surrogate models and symbolic regression.

Result: Significant error reductions with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for multiple tasks, achieving performance competitive with and often superior to state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs.

Conclusion: MatterVial provides a unified, high-performance, and transparent framework that advances materials informatics through explainable AI principles, enabling more targeted and autonomous materials discovery.

Abstract: This study introduces MatterVial, an innovative hybrid framework for
feature-based machine learning in materials science. MatterVial expands the
feature space by integrating latent representations from a diverse suite of
pretrained graph neural network (GNN) models including: structure-based
(MEGNet), composition-based (ROOST), and equivariant (ORB) graph networks, with
computationally efficient, GNN-approximated descriptors and novel features from
symbolic regression. Our approach combines the chemical transparency of
traditional feature-based models with the predictive power of deep learning
architectures. When augmenting the feature-based model MODNet on Matbench
tasks, this method yields significant error reductions and elevates its
performance to be competitive with, and in several cases superior to,
state-of-the-art end-to-end GNNs, with accuracy increases exceeding 40% for
multiple tasks. An integrated interpretability module, employing surrogate
models and symbolic regression, decodes the latent GNN-derived descriptors into
explicit, physically meaningful formulas. This unified framework advances
materials informatics by providing a high-performance, transparent tool that
aligns with the principles of explainable AI, paving the way for more targeted
and autonomous materials discovery.

*Harald Störrle,Anastasia Hort*

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: Simple statistical methods outperform complex models for predicting surgery durations when combined with expert domain knowledge, enabling accurate forecasts with small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing operating theater utilization through better surgery scheduling can reduce hospital costs and improve medical outcomes. Previous approaches required large datasets and complex models.

Method: Combined factor analysis and regression models guided by practitioner expertise and theory-driven data analysis of the perioperative process.

Result: Simple central tendency methods performed equally or better than complex literature methods. Expert knowledge integration improved both data quality and model performance.

Conclusion: Integrating conventional data science with qualitative clinical studies yields better results than complex models, enabling effective predictions even with small datasets.

Abstract: Context: Utilization of operating theaters is a major cost driver in
hospitals. Optimizing this variable through optimized surgery schedules may
significantly lower cost and simultaneously improve medical outcomes. Previous
studies proposed various complex models to predict the duration of procedures,
the key ingredient to optimal schedules. They did so perusing large amounts of
data.
  Goals: We aspire to create an effective and efficient model to predict
operation durations based on only a small amount of data. Ideally, our model is
also simpler in structure, and thus easier to use.
  Methods: We immerse ourselves in the application domain to leverage
practitioners expertise. This way, we make the best use of our limited supply
of clinical data, and may conduct our data analysis in a theory-guided way. We
do a combined factor analysis and develop regression models to predict the
duration of the perioperative process.
  Findings: We found simple methods of central tendency to perform on a par
with much more complex methods proposed in the literature. In fact, they
sometimes outperform them. We conclude that combining expert knowledge with
data analysis may improve both data quality and model performance, allowing for
more accurate forecasts.
  Conclusion: We yield better results than previous researchers by integrating
conventional data science methods with qualitative studies of clinical settings
and process structure. Thus, we are able to leverage even small datasets.

*Iman Seyedi,Antonio Candelieri,Enza Messina,Francesco Archetti*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: This paper connects classical assignment problems to modern optimal transport theory, extending from linear assignment to Gromov-Wasserstein distances for structural matching problems like QAP. It presents GW variants including a multi-initialization strategy that achieves near-optimal solutions efficiently for large problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge classical assignment problems with modern optimal transport theory and provide efficient computational methods for Quadratic Assignment Problems and structural matching tasks that traditional exact methods struggle with at scale.

Method: The paper connects linear assignment to Monge/Kantorovich transport problems and Wasserstein distances, then extends to Gromov-Wasserstein distances for different metric spaces. It presents exact solvers, Genetic Algorithms, and multiple GW variants including a proposed GW-MultiInit strategy, entropic Sinkhorn approximations, and fused GW that integrates structural and feature information.

Result: Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales efficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical. Parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy and runtime.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical foundations, computational insights, and practical guidelines for applying optimal transport and Gromov-Wasserstein methods to QAP and real-world matching problems in machine learning and logistics, demonstrating the effectiveness of GW approaches for structural alignment tasks.

Abstract: The assignment problem, a cornerstone of operations research, seeks an
optimal one-to-one mapping between agents and tasks to minimize total cost.
This work traces its evolution from classical formulations and algorithms to
modern optimal transport (OT) theory, positioning the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP) and related structural matching tasks within this framework. We
connect the linear assignment problem to Monge's transport problem,
Kantorovich's relaxation, and Wasserstein distances, then extend to cases where
source and target lie in different metric-measure spaces requiring
Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances. GW formulations, including the fused GW
variant that integrates structural and feature information, naturally address
QAP-like problems by optimizing alignment based on both intra-domain distances
and cross-domain attributes. Applications include graph matching, keypoint
correspondence, and feature-based assignments. We present exact solvers,
Genetic Algorithms (GA), and multiple GW variants, including a proposed
multi-initialization strategy (GW-MultiInit) that mitigates the risk of getting
stuck in local optima alongside entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations and
fused GW. Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show that
GW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales
efficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical, while
parameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy
and runtime. Our findings provide theoretical foundations, computational
insights, and practical guidelines for applying OT and GW methods to QAP and
other real-world matching problems, such as those in machine learning and
logistics.

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: First theoretical convergence analysis of shuffling methods for variational inequalities, showing faster convergence than independent sampling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variational inequalities are important in ML/optimization, but existing stochastic methods assume independent sampling while practical shuffling approaches lack theoretical guarantees.

Method: Theoretical analysis of shuffling heuristic (permuting dataset before sequential processing) for variational inequalities, providing rigorous convergence bounds and rates.

Result: Established first theoretical convergence estimates for shuffling methods in variational inequalities, with extensive experiments showing faster convergence compared to independent sampling.

Conclusion: Shuffling methods provide superior convergence performance for variational inequalities, filling an important theoretical gap and validating practical utility of this approach.

Abstract: Variational inequalities have gained significant attention in machine
learning and optimization research. While stochastic methods for solving these
problems typically assume independent data sampling, we investigate an
alternative approach -- the shuffling heuristic. This strategy involves
permuting the dataset before sequential processing, ensuring equal
consideration of all data points. Despite its practical utility, theoretical
guarantees for shuffling in variational inequalities remain unexplored. We
address this gap by providing the first theoretical convergence estimates for
shuffling methods in this context. Our analysis establishes rigorous bounds and
convergence rates, extending the theoretical framework for this important class
of algorithms. We validate our findings through extensive experiments on
diverse benchmark variational inequality problems, demonstrating faster
convergence of shuffling methods compared to independent sampling approaches.

Conclusion: COBRA enables scalable deployment for personalized obesity interventions and continuous lifestyle monitoring through objective, accurate behavioral classification using wearable sensors.

Abstract: Chronic obesity management requires continuous monitoring of energy balance
behaviors, yet traditional self-reported methods suffer from significant
underreporting and recall bias, and difficulty in integration with modern
digital health systems. This study presents COBRA (Chronic Obesity Behavioral
Recognition Architecture), a novel deep learning framework for objective
behavioral monitoring using wrist-worn multimodal sensors. COBRA integrates a
hybrid D-Net architecture combining U-Net spatial modeling, multi-head
self-attention mechanisms, and BiLSTM temporal processing to classify daily
activities into four obesity-relevant categories: Food Intake, Physical
Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Daily Living. Validated on the WISDM-Smart
dataset with 51 subjects performing 18 activities, COBRA's optimal
preprocessing strategy combines spectral-temporal feature extraction, achieving
high performance across multiple architectures. D-Net demonstrates 96.86%
overall accuracy with category-specific F1-scores of 98.55% (Physical
Activity), 95.53% (Food Intake), 94.63% (Sedentary Behavior), and 98.68% (Daily

framework shows robust generalizability with low demographic variance (<3%),

*Marco Vetrano,Tiziano Zingales,G. Massimo Palma,Salvatore Lorenzo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) are introduced for exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval, offering a fault-tolerant quantum computing approach that reduces computational overhead compared to traditional forward modeling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional exoplanetary atmospheric studies rely on computationally intensive forward models with high-dimensional parameter spaces, creating significant computational overhead that needs to be addressed.

Method: The paper proposes using quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) as a quantum machine learning technique that employs quantum systems as black boxes for processing input data, with an intrinsically fault-tolerant strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices.

Result: The framework demonstrates fault tolerance through direct implementation on IBM Fez quantum hardware, showing potential for quantum computing in astrophysical data analysis.

Conclusion: QELM architecture shows promise for enabling fast, efficient, and more accurate computational tools in exoplanetary atmospheric studies, potentially unlocking new capabilities for near-term quantum devices in astrophysics.

Abstract: The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models
to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous
chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter
space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum
extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning
techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input
data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary
atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant
strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault
tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we
present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of
astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new
computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.

TL;DR: LLM-informed hierarchical Bayesian modeling for clinical trials that uses language models to derive informative priors, reducing patient numbers needed while improving safety assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the number of patients required in clinical trials while maintaining statistical power by leveraging LLM knowledge to inform Bayesian priors for adverse event modeling.

Method: Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework that systematically elicits informative priors from pre-trained LLMs for hyperparameters, avoiding synthetic data generation and directly obtaining parametric priors.

Result: LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches, as validated through temperature sensitivity analysis and cross-validation on real clinical trial data.

Conclusion: This approach enables more efficient clinical trial design with substantial patient reductions, potentially transforming drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision making through expert-informed Bayesian safety modeling.

Abstract: Imagine a world where clinical trials need far fewer patients to achieve the
same statistical power, thanks to the knowledge encoded in large language
models (LLMs). We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling
of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed
prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate
synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from
the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for
hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM,
enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into
Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity
analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we
demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance
compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the
way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling
substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust
safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring
and regulatory decision making.

Motivation: Achieving high fidelity, computational efficiency, and precise control in generating diverse and plausible future trajectories for autonomous vehicle planning systems remains challenging despite recent generative model advances.

Method: Uses conditional latent diffusion with two-stage normalization (geometric scaling then PCA latent space normalization), MLP denoiser in low-dimensional latent space, and Transformer-based StateEncoder for scene context fusion.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Motion Dataset with minADE of 0.25. Ablation study shows multi-step sparse route goals enable precise tactical execution mirroring human driving behavior.

Conclusion: The method successfully combines computational efficiency with high-fidelity trajectory generation, demonstrating that rich multi-step goal representations are essential for nuanced human-like driving behavior in autonomous systems.

Abstract: The ability to generate a diverse and plausible distribution of future
trajectories is a critical capability for autonomous vehicle planning systems.
While recent generative models have shown promise, achieving high fidelity,
computational efficiency, and precise control remains a significant challenge.
In this paper, we present the \textbf{Efficient Virtuoso}, a conditional latent
diffusion model for goal-conditioned trajectory planning. Our approach
introduces a novel two-stage normalization pipeline that first scales
trajectories to preserve their geometric aspect ratio and then normalizes the
resulting PCA latent space to ensure a stable training target. The denoising
process is performed efficiently in this low-dimensional latent space by a
simple MLP denoiser, which is conditioned on a rich scene context fused by a
powerful Transformer-based StateEncoder. We demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset,
reaching a \textbf{minADE of 0.25}. Furthermore, through a rigorous ablation
study on goal representation, we provide a key insight: while a single endpoint
goal can resolve strategic ambiguity, a richer, multi-step sparse route is
essential for enabling the precise, high-fidelity tactical execution that
mirrors nuanced human driving behavior.

Motivation: Current robotic systems are limited by serial mechanisms and hardware constraints, which restrict the scope of robotic intelligence and embodied AI progress.

Method: Decomposes design into four tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and complete mechanism design using reciprocal screw theory and kinematic synthesis methods.

Result: Successfully generates novel parallel mechanisms with fixed and variable mobility, including configurations not previously documented in literature, validated through three case studies.

Conclusion: INGRID bridges mechanism theory and machine learning, enabling researchers without robotics training to create custom parallel mechanisms and decoupling robotic intelligence advances from hardware constraints.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has
accelerated progress in embodied artificial intelligence, yet current
approaches remain constrained by existing robotic architectures, particularly
serial mechanisms. This hardware dependency fundamentally limits the scope of
robotic intelligence. Here, we present INGRID (Intelligent Generative Robotic

mechanisms through deep integration with reciprocal screw theory and kinematic
synthesis methods. We decompose the design challenge into four progressive
tasks: constraint analysis, kinematic joint generation, chain construction, and
complete mechanism design. INGRID demonstrates the ability to generate novel
parallel mechanisms with both fixed and variable mobility, discovering
kinematic configurations not previously documented in the literature. We
validate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID
assists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired
mobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine
learning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to
create custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic
intelligence from hardware constraints. This work establishes a foundation for
mechanism intelligence, where AI systems actively design robotic hardware,

Abstract: Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with

*Neha Sunil,Megha Tippur,Arnau Saumell,Edward Adelson,Alberto Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-arm visuotactile framework for garment manipulation that combines confidence-aware visual correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to handle crumpled and suspended clothing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clothing manipulation is challenging due to complex configurations, variable material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten garments or assume visibility of key features.

Method: Uses a confidence-aware dense visual correspondence model trained on custom simulated data with distributional loss for cloth symmetries, plus a visuotactile grasp affordance network self-supervised with tactile feedback. Features a reactive state machine that adapts strategies based on perceptual uncertainty.

Result: System handles highly occluded table-top and in-air configurations by deferring action in low-confidence states. Demonstrates task-agnostic grasp selection in folding and hanging tasks, with dense descriptors providing reusable intermediate representation.

Conclusion: The framework enables more generalizable and scalable garment manipulation, paving the way for extracting grasp targets from human demonstrations and other planning modalities.

Abstract: Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.

*Hao-Shu Fang,Branden Romero,Yichen Xie,Arthur Hu,Bo-Ruei Huang,Juan Alvarez,Matthew Kim,Gabriel Margolis,Kavya Anbarasu,Masayoshi Tomizuka,Edward Adelson,Pulkit Agrawal*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DEXOP is a passive hand exoskeleton that enables natural human manipulation data collection for robots through direct force feedback and pose mirroring, outperforming teleoperation in data quality and transfer efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of teleoperation for robotic data collection by creating a more natural and efficient way to capture human manipulation skills with rich sensory data that transfers well to real robots.

Method: Developed DEXOP - a passive hand exoskeleton that mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing direct contact feedback and mirroring human hand poses to the robot hand for natural task demonstrations.

Result: DEXOP enables high-quality demonstration data collection at scale across diverse dexterous tasks. Policies learned from DEXOP data significantly outperform those from teleoperation in task performance per unit time of data collection.

Conclusion: DEXOP represents an effective paradigm (perioperation) for robotic data collection that maximizes human ability and data transferability, making it a powerful tool for advancing robot dexterity through natural human demonstrations.

Abstract: We introduce perioperation, a paradigm for robotic data collection that
sensorizes and records human manipulation while maximizing the transferability
of the data to real robots. We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand
exoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision
+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural
environments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,
providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors
the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of
demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make
task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,
increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of
dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect
high-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data
significantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection
compared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot
dexterity. Our project page is at https://dex-op.github.io.

*Lennart Clasmeier,Jan-Gerrit Habekost,Connor Gäde,Philipp Allgeuer,Stefan Wermter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning that achieves 10x faster runtime than numerical planners while maintaining 90% success rate on collision-free solutions, even without point cloud conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Numerical planning approaches for robotic motion planning have significant runtime requirements. The authors aim to leverage deep learning to achieve similar results with much smaller runtime by learning from planner-generated datasets.

Method: Proposed a novel diffusion-based action model that initially used point cloud embeddings as input to predict keypoint-based joint sequences. After identifying dataset biases and conditioning challenges, they refined the dataset and found the model performs well even without point cloud encodings.

Result: The model outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude in runtime while achieving up to 90% success rate for collision-free solutions on the test set. The ablation study showed challenges in conditioning on point cloud embeddings.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based models can significantly accelerate robotic motion planning while maintaining high success rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from numerical planner datasets even without complex point cloud conditioning.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.

### [246] [Balancing Signal and Variance: Adaptive Offline RL Post-Training for VLA Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04063)
*Hongyin Zhang,Shiyuan Zhang,Junxi Jin,Qixin Zeng,Yifan Qiao,Hongchao Lu,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ARFM introduces offline RL fine-tuning for VLA flow models using adaptive scaling to balance RL advantage preservation and flow loss variance control, improving action accuracy in complex robotic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA flow models rely solely on imitation learning and struggle with action accuracy on complex tasks due to insufficient understanding of data quality distribution properties, which RL can address.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM) - an offline RL fine-tuning algorithm that introduces an adaptively adjusted scaling factor in VLA flow model loss to create a bias-variance trade-off objective function.

Result: ARFM shows excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot learning, and continuous learning performance in both simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The offline RL post-training approach with adaptive scaling enables more stable and efficient fine-tuning of VLA flow models, significantly improving their performance on complex robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.

### [247] [LibriQuote: A Speech Dataset of Fictional Character Utterances for Expressive Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04072)
*Gaspard Michel,Elena V. Epure,Christophe Cerisara*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: LibriQuote is a large-scale English expressive speech dataset derived from audiobooks, containing both non-expressive and expressive speech with contextual annotations, designed for fine-tuning and benchmarking zero-shot TTS systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing large-scale TTS datasets lack clear expressive speech proportions, and current expressive speech corpora are too small and primarily used only for benchmarking rather than training.

Method: Created LibriQuote dataset from read audiobooks with 12.7K hours non-expressive speech and 5.3K hours expressive speech from character quotations, supplemented with context and pseudo-labels. Includes a 7.5-hour test set for benchmarking with neutral reference speech input.

Result: Fine-tuning TTS systems on LibriQuote significantly improves speech intelligibility. Recent systems still fail to synthesize speech as expressive and natural as ground-truth utterances, despite the dataset's wide emotional and accent coverage.

Conclusion: LibriQuote provides a valuable large-scale resource for both training and evaluating expressive zero-shot TTS systems, demonstrating that current systems have room for improvement in generating natural expressive speech.

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and
natural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the
proportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.
Besides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and
primarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the
LibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed
for both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The
training dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K
hours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each
utterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it
was written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to
describe the quotation (\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,
we provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS
systems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's
ability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference
timbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide
range of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various
accents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a
baseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech
intelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as
expressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances. The dataset and
evaluation code are freely available. Audio samples can be found at

### [249] [No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Recommendations Limit Human Agency in Resume Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04404)
*Kyra Wilson,Mattea Sim,Anna-Maria Gueorguieva,Aylin Caliskan*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Study shows people amplify AI racial bias in hiring decisions, with IAT tests reducing bias by 13%. Even when AI quality is questioned, human decisions remain vulnerable to AI bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how human-AI collaboration in resume screening amplifies or mitigates racial bias, particularly when AI systems exhibit race-based preferences, and to understand the role of unconscious biases in this process.

Method: Conducted a resume-screening experiment (N=528) with simulated AI models showing race-based bias approximating real-world systems. Used quality-controlled resumes with racial cues through names/affinity groups across 1,526 scenarios. Measured unconscious associations with implicit association tests (IATs).

Result: People select candidates equally without AI or with unbiased AI. With biased AI, people favor the AI-preferred group up to 90% of the time. IAT completion before screening increased selection of stereotype-nonconforming candidates by 13%. Decisions remain vulnerable to AI bias even when AI quality is questioned.

Conclusion: Human-AI collaboration can significantly amplify racial bias in hiring. Organizational policies must address the complexity of AI-human decision making, including education and oversight requirements for AI hiring systems to mitigate bias.

Abstract: In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people
collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias)
to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI
bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in
real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,
Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups
on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their
unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association
tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been
investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or
with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates
at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,
people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a
significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose
identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%
if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if
people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their
decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This
work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,
design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias
in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and
regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision
making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and
determining which are subject to oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye-tracking provides valuable insights into student cognition but remains underutilized in classrooms due to data interpretation challenges and accessibility issues.

Method: Iterative user-centered design through five studies involving teachers and students, using gaze data visualizations, layered explanations, narrative scaffolds, and an LLM-powered conversational agent for natural language interactions.

Result: Gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable when supported by familiar visualizations and narrative scaffolds. The conversational agent successfully lowered cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data.

Conclusion: Design implications for integrating novel data modalities like eye-tracking in educational technology through user-centered approaches and natural language interfaces.

Abstract: Eye-tracking offers rich insights into student cognition and engagement, but
remains underutilized in classroom-facing educational technology due to
challenges in data interpretation and accessibility. In this paper, we present
the iterative design and evaluation of a gaze-based learning analytics
dashboard for English Language Arts (ELA), developed through five studies
involving teachers and students. Guided by user-centered design and data
storytelling principles, we explored how gaze data can support reflection,
formative assessment, and instructional decision-making. Our findings
demonstrate that gaze analytics can be approachable and pedagogically valuable
when supported by familiar visualizations, layered explanations, and narrative
scaffolds. We further show how a conversational agent, powered by a large
language model (LLM), can lower cognitive barriers to interpreting gaze data by
enabling natural language interactions with multimodal learning analytics. We
conclude with design implications for future EdTech systems that aim to
integrate novel data modalities in classroom contexts.

*Christian Merz,Lukas Schach,Marie Luisa Fiedler,Jean-Luc Lugrin,Carolin Wienrich,Marc Erich Latoschik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: A deep learning method for detecting behavior changes in XR through motion analysis without user input, outperforming traditional motion analysis and questionnaires.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an unobtrusive, in-situ measurement method for detecting user behavior changes during XR exposures, particularly those associated with the Proteus effect and bodily affordances from different avatars.

Method: A biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning that uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify individual user behavior changes. Evaluated against traditional motion analysis and subjective questionnaires in a within-subject study with different avatar heights.

Result: The similarity learning model successfully identified behavior changes across avatar conditions, outperforming non-learned motion analysis. Subjective assessments confirmed effective body schema manipulation, and objective analyses showed significant movement differences.

Conclusion: The approach offers advantages including in-situ measurement without additional user input, generalizable motion analysis, user-specific evaluation, and real-time capability for studying avatar-induced behavior changes.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unobtrusive in-situ measurement method to detect
user behavior changes during arbitrary exposures in XR systems. Here, such
behavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily
affordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We
present a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which
uses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior
changes of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative
approaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of
movement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires
frequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,
participants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of
different body heights (short, actual-height, and tall). Subjective assessments
confirmed the effective manipulation of perceived body schema, while the
(non-learned) objective analyses of head and hand movements revealed
significant differences across conditions. Our similarity learning model
trained on the motion data successfully identified the elicited behavior change
for various query and reference data pairings of the avatar conditions. The
approach has several advantages in comparison to existing methods: 1) In-situ
measurement without additional user input, 2) generalizable and scalable motion
analysis for various use cases, 3) user-specific analysis on the individual
level, and 4) with a trained model, users can be added and evaluated in real
time to study how avatar changes affect behavior.

TL;DR: HumAIne-chatbot uses reinforcement learning and user profiling to personalize AI conversations, showing significant improvements in user satisfaction and personalization accuracy compared to generic chatbots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current conversational AI systems provide generic interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive dialogue management, creating a need for more personalized AI interactions.

Method: The system uses a novel user profiling framework pre-trained on GPT-generated virtual personas, combined with online reinforcement learning that refines per-user models using both implicit signals (typing speed, sentiment, engagement) and explicit feedback (likes/dislikes).

Result: Controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas showed consistent improvements in user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when personalization features were enabled, with statistical analysis confirming significant differences and large effect sizes.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for future real-world validation of personalized conversational agents.

Abstract: Current conversational AI systems often provide generic, one-size-fits-all
interactions that overlook individual user characteristics and lack adaptive
dialogue management. To address this gap, we introduce
\textbf{HumAIne-chatbot}, an AI-driven conversational agent that personalizes
responses through a novel user profiling framework. The system is pre-trained
on a diverse set of GPT-generated virtual personas to establish a broad prior
over user types. During live interactions, an online reinforcement learning
agent refines per-user models by combining implicit signals (e.g. typing speed,
sentiment, engagement duration) with explicit feedback (e.g., likes and
dislikes). This profile dynamically informs the chatbot dialogue policy,
enabling real-time adaptation of both content and style. To evaluate the
system, we performed controlled experiments with 50 synthetic personas in
multiple conversation domains. The results showed consistent improvements in
user satisfaction, personalization accuracy, and task achievement when
personalization features were enabled. Statistical analysis confirmed
significant differences between personalized and nonpersonalized conditions,
with large effect sizes across key metrics. These findings highlight the
effectiveness of AI-driven user profiling and provide a strong foundation for
future real-world validation.

Motivation: Existing debugging datasets focus on function-level code repair and lack diversity in tasks, languages, and error types, failing to capture the complexity of real-world repository-level debugging scenarios.

Method: Introduces RepoDebug - a multi-task, multi-language repository-level debugging dataset with 22 error subtypes, supporting 8 programming languages and 3 debugging tasks. Evaluated 10 LLMs on this dataset.

Result: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well in repository-level debugging, demonstrating the significant challenges LLMs face in complex debugging scenarios.

Conclusion: Repository-level debugging presents substantial challenges for current LLMs, and the proposed RepoDebug dataset provides a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and advancing code debugging capabilities in realistic development environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant proficiency in code
debugging, especially in automatic program repair, which may substantially
reduce the time consumption of developers and enhance their efficiency.
Significant advancements in debugging datasets have been made to promote the
development of code debugging. However, these datasets primarily focus on
assessing the LLM's function-level code repair capabilities, neglecting the
more complex and realistic repository-level scenarios, which leads to an
incomplete understanding of the LLM's challenges in repository-level debugging.
While several repository-level datasets have been proposed, they often suffer
from limitations such as limited diversity of tasks, languages, and error
types. To mitigate this challenge, this paper introduces RepoDebug, a
multi-task and multi-language repository-level code debugging dataset with 22
subtypes of errors that supports 8 commonly used programming languages and 3
debugging tasks. Furthermore, we conduct evaluation experiments on 10 LLMs,
where Claude 3.5 Sonnect, the best-performing model, still cannot perform well
in repository-level debugging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Python packages face increasing security concerns with numerous vulnerability reports, and current detection tools' effectiveness remains underexplored, especially given Python's frequent cooperation with other languages which adds complexity to vulnerabilities.

Method: Developed PyVul benchmark with 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities linked to affected packages. Used LLM-assisted data cleansing for high accuracy annotations at commit and function levels. Conducted distribution analysis and evaluated state-of-the-art detectors.

Result: Achieved 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy. Found vulnerabilities involve multiple programming languages with wide variety of types. Multi-lingual Python packages are more susceptible. Current detection tools show significant limitations in identifying real-world security issues.

Conclusion: PyVul establishes the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark, revealing critical gaps in current detection capabilities and highlighting the need for future advancements in Python package security analysis.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for
its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units
of organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,
highlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting
language, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or
interoperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to
Python packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools
remains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,
the first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.
PyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,
each linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection
techniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An
LLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,
achieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul
as the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further
carry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that
vulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and
exhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that
multi-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to
vulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark
reveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools
and the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python
packages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs
observed in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of
current detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in
the field.

TL;DR: Extended gravity well model with dynamic confirmation bias variable improves echo chamber detection on Reddit communities


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing echo chamber models overlook individual confirmation bias, which plays a central role in misinformation spread

Method: Extended the established gravity well model by adding a dynamic confirmation bias variable that adjusts pull strength based on user's susceptibility to belief-reinforcing content, calculated through posting history and response analysis

Result: Validated on 19 Reddit communities, demonstrating improved echo chamber detection and revealing community-level markers of information health

Conclusion: Provides a framework for systematically capturing confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective echo chamber identification to curb misinformation spread

Abstract: Social media echo chambers play a central role in the spread of
misinformation, yet existing models often overlook the influence of individual
confirmation bias. An existing model of echo chambers is the "gravity well"
model, which creates an analog between echo chambers and spatial gravity wells.
We extend this established model by introducing a dynamic confirmation bias
variable that adjusts the strength of pull based on a user's susceptibility to
belief-reinforcing content. This variable is calculated for each user through
comparisons between their posting history and their responses to posts of a
wide range of viewpoints.
  Incorporating this factor produces a confirmation-bias-integrated gravity
well model that more accurately identifies echo chambers and reveals
community-level markers of information health. We validated the approach on
nineteen Reddit communities, demonstrating improved detection of echo chambers.
  Our contribution is a framework for systematically capturing the role of
confirmation bias in online group dynamics, enabling more effective
identification of echo chambers. By flagging these high-risk environments, the
model supports efforts to curb the spread of misinformation at its most common
points of amplification.

*Shakiba Amirshahi,Amin Bigdeli,Charles L. A. Clarke,Amira Ghenai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RAG systems are vulnerable to misinformation from retrieved documents, especially in health domain. Adversarial documents degrade alignment with ground truth, but helpful evidence can preserve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems can reduce LLM hallucinations but introduce vulnerability to misinformation in retrieved evidence, particularly problematic in high-stakes domains like healthcare where incorrect responses can cause harm.

Method: Controlled experiments using health questions, varying document types (helpful, harmful, adversarial) and question framing (consistent, neutral, inconsistent), evaluating alignment between model outputs and evidence-based ground truth.

Result: Adversarial documents substantially degrade alignment with ground truth, but robustness can be maintained when helpful evidence is present in the retrieval pool.

Conclusion: Retrieval safeguards are needed for safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains. Findings provide actionable insights for designing more robust RAG architectures.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually
grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved
evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can
reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer
questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design
introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce
misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if
retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to
promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG
robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs
and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential
for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of
evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We
conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the
type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and
adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,
neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents
substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful
evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable
insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting
the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate
future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: NER Retriever is a zero-shot framework that uses LLM internal representations (mid-layer value vectors) to embed entities and type descriptions for schema-free named entity retrieval, outperforming existing baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NER requires predefined entity types, but real-world applications need flexible retrieval based on user-defined type descriptions without fixed schemas or fine-tuned models.

Method: Uses internal representations from mid-layer transformer blocks of LLMs to embed entities and type descriptions, then trains a lightweight contrastive projection network to align type-compatible entities in semantic space.

Result: Significantly outperforms lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines on three benchmarks, producing compact, type-aware embeddings suitable for nearest-neighbor search.

Conclusion: Mid-layer LLM representations effectively encode fine-grained type information, providing a scalable, schema-free solution for entity retrieval with empirical support for representation selection within LLMs.

Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named
Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types
of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is
used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying
on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal
representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions
and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We
show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from
mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more
effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these
representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that
aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting
entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor
search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms
both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide
empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a
practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER
Retriever Codebase is publicly available at

TL;DR: ACT framework automatically finds minimal hyperparameter changes to satisfy guardrail constraints in recommender systems, using offline pairwise evaluation and continuous retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems need to maximize primary objectives while ensuring secondary guardrail constraints are met, but manual hyperparameter tuning is challenging and doesn't adapt well to system changes.

Method: Automated Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework uses offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find minimal hyperparameter solutions and continuously retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes.

Result: The framework demonstrates efficacy and has been deployed in a large-scale production environment.

Conclusion: ACT provides an automated solution for maintaining guardrail constraints in recommender systems while minimizing manual tuning efforts and adapting to system evolution.

Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring
secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical
for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but
enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and
often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated
Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set
of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an
offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously
retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically
demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale
production environment.

*Dror Aiger,Bingyi Cao,Kaifeng Chen,Andre Araujo*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Proposes a local-to-global image retrieval paradigm that combines efficient local feature search with global feature re-ranking, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional global-to-local retrieval misses partial matches that local features can find, while emerging efficient local search and global re-ranking techniques enable a new approach.

Method: Uses efficient local feature search first, then performs global feature re-ranking with on-the-fly computed global features based on local similarity matches using multidimensional scaling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets, demonstrating solid retrieval performance.

Conclusion: The local-to-global paradigm with on-the-fly global feature computation effectively leverages both local and global information for improved image retrieval.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large
databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with
local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local,
stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only
be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient
local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular
enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are
often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based
re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In
this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global
retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global
feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global
features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval
similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional
scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities
obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.
Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new
state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotation for relevance evaluation is expensive and slow, limiting scalability for personalized search systems.

Method: Fine-tuned LLMs to generate relevance judgments, with rigorous validation against human annotations.

Result: LLMs provide reliable relevance measurement, improve evaluation efficiency, expand query set capabilities, optimize sampling, and reduce Minimum Detectable Effect.

Conclusion: LLM-based automation enables scalable, high-quality relevance evaluation for search experiments with significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to
ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human
annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost
and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our
approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online
experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between
LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can
provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving
the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the
opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and
efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach
leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum
Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed
to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in
both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges
of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by
generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve
dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding

further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model
using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries
and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our
approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that
Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both
precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating
query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and
comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of

Motivation: To deliver effective personalized Pins and ads on Pinterest by constructing high-quality user and item embeddings from diverse data sources in a scalable manner.

Method: Upstream models trained on extensive data with varied signals using complex architectures to capture user-Pin relationships. Entity embeddings are learned and refreshed regularly (not real-time) for scalability. Downstream tasks use these embeddings as input features for ad retrieval and ranking models.

Result: Achieves notable performance improvements in both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. Successfully deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems with significant gains in online metrics.

Conclusion: The upstream-downstream framework provides an effective and scalable solution for learning user and item embeddings that significantly improve personalized recommendation and advertising performance on Pinterest.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an
upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from
diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized
Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data
sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture
intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure
scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and
regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for
asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These
embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks,
including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We
demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in
both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This
framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems,

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: BiND is a two-stage model that first classifies hand movement type then uses specialized GRU decoders to predict continuous hand velocities, outperforming six state-of-the-art models in bimanual decoding from intracortical recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decoding bimanual hand movements from brain signals is challenging due to overlapping neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions, which existing BCIs struggle to handle effectively.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Classify motion type (unimanual left/right or bimanual), 2) Use specialized GRU-based decoders with trial-relative time index to predict continuous 2D hand velocities.

Result: Achieved mean R² of 0.76 for unimanual and 0.69 for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing GRU by 2% in both tasks. Showed 4% better robustness to session variability in cross-session analyses.

Conclusion: Task-aware discrimination combined with temporal modeling significantly enhances bimanual decoding performance and robustness to session variability in brain-computer interfaces.

Abstract: Decoding bimanual hand movements from intracortical recordings remains a
critical challenge for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), due to overlapping
neural representations and nonlinear interlimb interactions. We introduce BiND
(Bimanual Neural Discriminator-Decoder), a two-stage model that first
classifies motion type (unimanual left, unimanual right, or bimanual) and then
uses specialized GRU-based decoders, augmented with a trial-relative time
index, to predict continuous 2D hand velocities. We benchmark BiND against six
state-of-the-art models (SVR, XGBoost, FNN, CNN, Transformer, GRU) on a
publicly available 13-session intracortical dataset from a tetraplegic patient.
BiND achieves a mean $R^2$ of 0.76 ($\pm$0.01) for unimanual and 0.69
($\pm$0.03) for bimanual trajectory prediction, surpassing the next-best model
(GRU) by 2% in both tasks. It also demonstrates greater robustness to session
variability than all other benchmarked models, with accuracy improvements of up
to 4% compared to GRU in cross-session analyses. This highlights the
effectiveness of task-aware discrimination and temporal modeling in enhancing
bimanual decoding.

*Niclas Dern,Lennart Redl,Sebastian Pfister,Marcel Kollovieh,David Lüdke,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: EWFM enables continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art sample quality with dramatically fewer energy computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for sampling from Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of target samples or cannot effectively leverage advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows when trained only with energy evaluations.

Method: Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM) reformulates conditional flow matching via importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal distributions. Two algorithms: iterative EWFM (progressive refinement) and annealed EWFM (with temperature annealing).

Result: On benchmark systems including challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, the algorithms achieve sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while requiring up to 1000x fewer energy evaluations.

Conclusion: EWFM provides an efficient framework for sampling from complex Boltzmann distributions using only energy function evaluations, making it particularly valuable for scientific applications with computationally expensive energy calculations.

Abstract: Sampling from unnormalized target distributions, e.g. Boltzmann distributions
$\mu_{\text{target}}(x) \propto \exp(-E(x)/T)$, is fundamental to many
scientific applications yet computationally challenging due to complex,
high-dimensional energy landscapes. Existing approaches applying modern
generative models to Boltzmann distributions either require large datasets of
samples drawn from the target distribution or, when using only energy
evaluations for training, cannot efficiently leverage the expressivity of
advanced architectures like continuous normalizing flows that have shown
promise for molecular sampling. To address these shortcomings, we introduce
Energy-Weighted Flow Matching (EWFM), a novel training objective enabling
continuous normalizing flows to model Boltzmann distributions using only energy
function evaluations. Our objective reformulates conditional flow matching via
importance sampling, allowing training with samples from arbitrary proposal
distributions. Based on this objective, we develop two algorithms: iterative
EWFM (iEWFM), which progressively refines proposals through iterative training,
and annealed EWFM (aEWFM), which additionally incorporates temperature
annealing for challenging energy landscapes. On benchmark systems, including
challenging 55-particle Lennard-Jones clusters, our algorithms demonstrate
sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art energy-only methods while
requiring up to three orders of magnitude fewer energy evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of diffusion models for synthetic data generation by reducing computational costs through dimension reduction techniques.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) compress data into latent space, (2) train diffusion model in latent space, (3) apply compressed sensing algorithm to generated latent samples. Uses sparsity assumptions for theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Proven faster convergence under sparsity assumptions, optimal latent dimension determination, and successful numerical experiments across diverse datasets including images and financial time series.

Conclusion: The integration of compressed sensing with diffusion models enables efficient synthetic data generation with theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness across multiple domains.

Abstract: This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion
model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to
integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into
a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii)
apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent
space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under
suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to
enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse
recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space
dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets,
including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and
financial time series for stress testing.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: Four new methods for testing correlation between node features and network structure, with two based on linear modeling and two using canonical correlation analysis, providing theoretical guarantees and computational advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common problem of assessing whether nodal covariates are correlated with network structure in domains where networks have node-level features, as existing approaches are computationally expensive and require strong modeling assumptions.

Method: Developed four novel methods: two based on linear models relating node covariates to latent variables driving network structure, and two using canonical correlation analysis between node features and network structure without linear modeling assumptions.

Result: The methods provide theoretical guarantees for low-rank latent space models with high-dimensional covariates, are computationally cheaper than previous approaches, and demonstrate good performance on both simulated and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed methods offer effective and efficient solutions for network dependency testing with fewer modeling assumptions, making them suitable for practical applications with node-level features in network analysis.

Abstract: In many application domains, networks are observed with node-level features.
In such settings, a common problem is to assess whether or not nodal covariates
are correlated with the network structure itself. Here, we present four novel
methods for addressing this problem. Two of these are based on a linear model
relating node-level covariates to latent node-level variables that drive
network structure. The other two are based on applying canonical correlation
analysis to the node features and network structure, avoiding the linear
modeling assumptions. We provide theoretical guarantees for all four methods
when the observed network is generated according to a low-rank latent space
model endowed with node-level covariates, which we allow to be
high-dimensional. Our methods are computationally cheaper and require fewer
modeling assumptions than previous approaches to network dependency testing. We
demonstrate and compare the performance of our novel methods on both simulated
and real-world data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a generative model that can both simulate from likelihood and sample from posterior distributions for inverse problems

Method: Combine two triangular normalizing flows (upper and lower maps) into one invertible mapping, propose training loss for direct map training

Result: Developed invertible generative model with useful properties for conditional sampling, demonstrated on stylized examples

Conclusion: New approach to conditional generative modeling using combined triangular flows enables both simulation and inference capabilities

Abstract: We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a
generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood)
and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of
triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show
how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one
invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out
several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a
possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the
workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on
a few stylized examples.

TL;DR: Novel bandit framework for MNL-based stochastic matching with batched algorithms achieving O(1) amortized computational cost and Õ(√T) regret bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational challenge of NP-hard combinatorial optimization in stochastic matching where naive approaches incur O(K^N) cost per round.

Method: Propose batched algorithms that limit matching update frequency, reducing amortized computational cost while maintaining performance.

Result: Achieve O(1) amortized computational cost per round (down from O(K^N)) while obtaining Õ(√T) regret bound for cumulative revenue maximization.

Conclusion: Batched algorithms effectively solve the computational complexity problem in MNL-based stochastic matching while maintaining optimal regret performance.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel bandit framework for stochastic matching
based on the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) choice model. In our setting, $N$ agents
on one side are assigned to $K$ arms on the other side, where each arm
stochastically selects an agent from its assigned pool according to an unknown
preference and yields a corresponding reward. The objective is to minimize
regret by maximizing the cumulative revenue from successful matches across all
agents. This task requires solving a combinatorial optimization problem based
on estimated preferences, which is NP-hard and leads a naive approach to incur
a computational cost of $O(K^N)$ per round. To address this challenge, we
propose batched algorithms that limit the frequency of matching updates,
thereby reducing the amortized computational cost (i.e., the average cost per
round) to $O(1)$ while still achieving a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$.

Conclusion: The analysis reveals deep connections between various post-training alignment techniques and provides a novel resampling method that can achieve alignment in diffusion models without requiring explicit reinforcement learning procedures.

Abstract: In this note, we reflect on several fundamental connections among widely used

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine when agents with different generative models of the same environment can translate their latent representations into each other's framework

Method: Develops mathematical conditions (natural latent conditions) that guarantee translatability between latent variables of different Bayesian agents

Result: Establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for guaranteed translatability, with robustness to approximation errors

Conclusion: Natural latent conditions provide the most general framework for ensuring functional translation between different latent variable models of the same environment

Abstract: Suppose two Bayesian agents each learn a generative model of the same
environment. We will assume the two have converged on the predictive
distribution, i.e. distribution over some observables in the environment, but
may have different generative models containing different latent variables.
Under what conditions can one agent guarantee that their latents are a function
of the other agents latents?
  We give simple conditions under which such translation is guaranteed to be
possible: the natural latent conditions. We also show that, absent further
constraints, these are the most general conditions under which translatability
is guaranteed. Crucially for practical application, our theorems are robust to
approximation error in the natural latent conditions.

TL;DR: Sparse optimization methods for discovering governing equations from data produce models that are sensitive to measurement procedures but generate identical chaotic attractors, challenging traditional equation-based modeling approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how imperfect data due to disturbances and measurement errors affects the reliability of sparse-optimization methods in discovering governing equations for chaotic systems.

Method: Analyzing chaotic systems using sparse-optimization methods and comparing the resulting models by calculating Koopman spectra to identify differences in eigenvalues.

Result: Different equation sets from sparse optimization produce virtually identical chaotic attractors despite being sensitive to measurement procedures, with differences appearing only in smaller eigenvalues below an equation-dependent threshold.

Conclusion: Finding governing equations through sparse optimization may lead to misleading physical interpretations; working directly with data using machine-learning methods is more reliable for complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a
popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering
the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and
measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used
sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models
that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models
generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking
limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling
in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the
different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the
differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an
equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing
equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to
misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the
available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.

Result: Successfully trained a single network to solve large-scale 2D Maxwell's equations with varying sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and dielectric media distributions, and demonstrated accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength nanophotonic devices.

Conclusion: The approach presents a promising path for building accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical engineering problems.

Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems
with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network
surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE
problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We
develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type
boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible
preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy.
We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of
global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving
based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional
Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate
large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and

judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG), grounded in a domain-specific knowledge base of landmark Indian legal
documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
specifically tailored to the Indian legal context and augmented with verifiable
legal grounding via RAG.

### [274] [Simplicity Lies in the Eye of the Beholder: A Strategic Perspective on Controllers in Reactive Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04129)
*Mickael Randour*

Main category: cs.LO

TL;DR: Analysis of strategy complexity in game-theoretic controller synthesis, focusing on memory and randomness requirements across different synthesis contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simple strategies with limited memory are believed to produce better real-world controllers that are easier to understand, produce, and maintain. The paper aims to understand the complexity requirements for winning/optimal strategies in various synthesis scenarios.

Method: The paper takes a game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, modeling system-environment interaction as a game. It analyzes recent results concerning memory requirements and randomness in strategies across different synthesis contexts.

Result: The contribution discusses recent findings on memory and randomness complexity in synthesis strategies, examining what lies beyond traditional complexity notions for strategies.

Conclusion: Understanding strategy complexity (memory and randomness requirements) is crucial for developing effective and practical controllers in game-theoretic synthesis approaches, with implications for controller design and implementation.

Abstract: In the game-theoretic approach to controller synthesis, we model the
interaction between a system to be controlled and its environment as a game
between these entities, and we seek an appropriate (e.g., winning or optimal)
strategy for the system. This strategy then serves as a formal blueprint for a
real-world controller. A common belief is that simple (e.g., using limited
memory) strategies are better: corresponding controllers are easier to conceive
and understand, and cheaper to produce and maintain.
  This invited contribution focuses on the complexity of strategies in a
variety of synthesis contexts. We discuss recent results concerning memory and
randomness, and take a brief look at what lies beyond our traditional notions
of complexity for strategies.

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: A new computational framework using physics-constrained neural fields and differentiable rendering achieves 10,000x speedup in radiative transfer modeling, enabling high-resolution 3D reconstruction of protoplanetary disk structures from ALMA observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protoplanetary disks are planet birthplaces, but traditional methods cannot capture their complex 3D structure at the unprecedented resolution provided by ALMA observations, requiring new modeling approaches.

Method: Developed RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line radiative transfer solver that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable rendering for high-dimensional neural reconstructions.

Result: Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, the framework recovered the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au that was missed by existing approaches.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for extracting complex disk structure and advancing understanding of protoplanetary evolution through high-speed, differentiable radiative transfer modeling.

Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the birthplaces of planets, and resolving their
three-dimensional structure is key to understanding disk evolution. The
unprecedented resolution of ALMA demands modeling approaches that capture
features beyond the reach of traditional methods. We introduce a computational
framework that integrates physics-constrained neural fields with differentiable
rendering and present RadJAX, a GPU-accelerated, fully differentiable line
radiative transfer solver achieving up to 10,000x speedups over conventional

reconstructions. Applied to ALMA CO observations of HD 163296, this framework
recovers the vertical morphology of the CO-rich layer, revealing a pronounced
narrowing and flattening of the emission surface beyond 400 au - a feature

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: A mapping framework for deep learning inference that uses predictable neural network behavior to pre-plan computation and communication, generating unified instruction/data streams for efficient hardware execution with minimal host involvement and off-chip memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on I/O, off-chip memory, and host control in deep learning inference by leveraging predictable neural network behavior to coordinate computation and communication efficiently.

Method: Uses fine-grained message passing on a programmable, message-based compute architecture with techniques like stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions to keep data movement local and coordinate computation across arrays.

Result: Achieves 88-92% utilization on VGG-19, with 97% internally generated messages and 89% on-chip transfer time. Scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s on larger arrays with traffic reductions up to 100 MB per layer from reuse and local aggregation.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effective streaming-based computation by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow, enabling efficient deep learning inference with minimal external dependencies.

Abstract: We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s
on larger arrays, while traffic reductions from reuse and local aggregation
reach up to 100 MB per layer. Overall, the results highlight the effectiveness
of streaming-based computation and show how our mapper enables this execution
style by tightly coordinating data and instruction flow across the hardware.

TL;DR: NeuroBreak is a top-down jailbreak analysis system that examines neuron-level safety mechanisms in LLMs to identify vulnerabilities and provide insights for developing better defense strategies against jailbreak attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing sophistication of jailbreak attacks that bypass safety alignment in LLMs creates security risks, but analyzing internal security mechanisms is challenging due to the complexity and large parameter count of modern LLMs.

Method: Developed NeuroBreak system through expert collaboration, incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis to examine model decision-making processes and analyze critical neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives.

Result: The system provides comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods and offers mechanistic insights through quantitative evaluations and case studies.

Conclusion: NeuroBreak enables deeper understanding of LLM security mechanisms and vulnerabilities, facilitating the development of next-generation defense strategies against evolving jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: In deployment and application, large language models (LLMs) typically undergo
safety alignment to prevent illegal and unethical outputs. However, the
continuous advancement of jailbreak attack techniques, designed to bypass
safety mechanisms with adversarial prompts, has placed increasing pressure on
the security defenses of LLMs. Strengthening resistance to jailbreak attacks
requires an in-depth understanding of the security mechanisms and
vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, the vast number of parameters and complex
structure of LLMs make analyzing security weaknesses from an internal
perspective a challenging task. This paper presents NeuroBreak, a top-down
jailbreak analysis system designed to analyze neuron-level safety mechanisms
and mitigate vulnerabilities. We carefully design system requirements through
collaboration with three experts in the field of AI security. The system
provides a comprehensive analysis of various jailbreak attack methods. By
incorporating layer-wise representation probing analysis, NeuroBreak offers a
novel perspective on the model's decision-making process throughout its
generation steps. Furthermore, the system supports the analysis of critical
neurons from both semantic and functional perspectives, facilitating a deeper
exploration of security mechanisms. We conduct quantitative evaluations and
case studies to verify the effectiveness of our system, offering mechanistic
insights for developing next-generation defense strategies against evolving

*Yifan Jia,Yanbin Wang,Jianguo Sun,Ye Tian,Peng Qian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LMAE4Eth is a multi-view learning framework that combines transaction semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge to significantly improve Ethereum fraud detection, outperforming 21 baselines by over 10% in F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods fail to capture transaction semantics and suffer from homogeneity in transaction records, while existing self-supervised graph learning methods have suboptimal performance for node-level tasks and scalability issues.

Method: Proposes TxCLM for transforming numerical transactions into linguistic representations with contrastive learning, MAGAE for masked graph autoencoding with layer-neighbor sampling for scalability, and cross-attention fusion to combine both embeddings.

Result: Outperforms 21 baseline approaches on three datasets, achieving over 10% improvement in F1-score on two datasets compared to the best baseline.

Conclusion: LMAE4Eth effectively addresses the limitations of current Ethereum fraud detection by capturing transaction semantics and improving scalability, demonstrating superior performance in fraud account detection.

Abstract: Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: KubeGuard is a runtime log-driven recommender framework that uses LLMs to analyze Kubernetes manifests and logs, generating least-privilege configurations to address overly permissive security risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kubernetes security challenges from misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and lateral movement attacks. Existing solutions focus on detection rather than mitigation.

Method: KubeGuard uses large language models with modular prompt-chaining workflows to analyze manifests and runtime logs. It performs two tasks: Resource Creation (for new resources) and Resource Refinement (for existing manifests) to generate least-privilege configurations.

Result: Evaluation shows KubeGuard effectively generates and refines manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments using both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Conclusion: KubeGuard provides practical, actionable least-privilege configuration guidance by translating runtime observability into security recommendations that users can review and adopt to enhance Kubernetes cluster security.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native
applications has introduced significant security challenges, such as
misconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to
address these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,
and lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions
focus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or
anomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime
log-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly
permissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments
through two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It
leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs
reflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.
This approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for
new resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.
KubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,
developers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our
evaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s
manifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both
proprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores
affirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime
observability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: LuxDiT is a novel method that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to generate HDR environment maps from visual input, addressing lighting estimation challenges through synthetic training and low-rank adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based lighting estimation is constrained by scarce and expensive ground-truth HDR environment maps. Existing methods struggle with indirect visual cues, global context inference, and HDR output recovery.

Method: Fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer on large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting. Uses low-rank adaptation finetuning strategy with collected HDR panoramas for better semantic alignment between input and predicted environment maps.

Result: Produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency details. Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: LuxDiT effectively learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes well to real-world scenes, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Estimating scene lighting from a single image or video remains a longstanding
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Learning-based approaches are
constrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are
expensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models
offer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult
due to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global
(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose
LuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion
transformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.
Trained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our
model learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes
effectively to real-world scenes. To improve semantic alignment between the
input and the predicted environment map, we introduce a low-rank adaptation
finetuning strategy using a collected dataset of HDR panoramas. Our method
produces accurate lighting predictions with realistic angular high-frequency
details, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: ContraGS enables training compressed 3D Gaussian Splatting models using codebooks and Bayesian inference, reducing memory usage 3.49x and accelerating training/rendering while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS requires large numbers of Gaussians for high quality, which consumes significant GPU memory and slows training/rendering due to memory access inefficiencies.

Method: Uses codebooks to compactly store Gaussian parameters and solves non-differentiable parameter learning via Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling over posterior distributions.

Result: Reduces peak training memory by 3.49x on average, accelerates training by 1.36x and rendering by 1.88x while maintaining close to state-of-art quality.

Conclusion: ContraGS successfully enables direct training on compressed 3DGS representations without reducing Gaussian counts, achieving significant memory and performance improvements with minimal quality loss.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world
scenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality
representation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.
However, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device
memory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs
with high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering
latencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this
work, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed
3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a
little loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a
set of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby
significantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been
demonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,
directly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.
ContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in
codebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a
Bayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that
effectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these
compressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS
significantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and
accelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),
while retraining close to state-of-art quality.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Proposes TensoIS, a learning-based framework that uses low-rank tensor components to estimate heterogeneous subsurface scattering parameters from multi-view images, leveraging Fractal Perlin noise to model real-world scattering heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for estimating scattering parameters either use analysis-by-synthesis methods or differentiable rendering, but few learning-based methods exist and they assume homogeneous media. There's no known distribution to explicitly model real-world heterogeneous scattering parameters.

Method: Created HeteroSynth dataset with photorealistic images of heterogeneous media using Fractal Perlin noise. Proposed TensoIS framework that uses learnable low-rank tensor components to represent 3D scattering parameter volumes from sparse multi-view observations.

Result: Evaluated on unseen heterogeneous variations from HeteroSynth test set, realistic smoke/cloud geometries, and real-world samples. Demonstrated effectiveness for inverse scattering of heterogeneous media.

Conclusion: This study explores Perlin noise distribution as a potential model for real-world heterogeneous scattering, providing a feed-forward solution to the under-constrained inverse scattering problem.

Abstract: Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.

*Lei Zhong,Yi Yang,Changjian Li*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SMooGPT uses LLMs to generate stylized human motions through body-part text reasoning, enabling interpretable and controllable motion generation that generalizes to new styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stylized motion generation methods suffer from low interpretability, limited control, poor generalization to new styles, and are biased towards walking motions due to dataset limitations.

Method: Proposes a reasoning-composition-generation approach using body-part text space as intermediate representation. Fine-tunes an LLM (SMooGPT) to act as reasoner, composer, and generator for stylized motions.

Result: The method achieves higher interpretability, fine-grained motion control, resolves content-style conflicts, and generalizes well to new styles through LLMs' open-vocabulary capabilities.

Conclusion: SMooGPT demonstrates effective text-driven stylized motion generation with improved interpretability and generalization compared to existing latent space approaches.

Abstract: Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,
especially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of
this task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and
the desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing
research attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or
conditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a
latent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite
the progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,
limited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than
``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this
paper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new
perspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)
human motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a
body-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and
reason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently
compositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation
via effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an
intermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a
reasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.
Our method executes in the body-part text space with much higher
interpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving
potential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to
new styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive
experiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized
motion generation.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel two-stage method that combines person-specific rendering with diffusion modeling to generate high-quality dynamic human avatars with realistic pose-dependent deformations and photorealism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches are limited - person-specific methods don't generalize across identities, while generative methods produce lower-quality static avatars without realistic pose-dependent deformations like cloth wrinkles.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Optimize person-specific UNets for each avatar capturing pose-dependent deformations, 2) Train hyper diffusion model over the optimized network weights to generate new avatars during inference.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods, achieving high photorealism with realistic pose-dependent deformations using a large-scale cross-identity multi-view video dataset.

Conclusion: Successfully unites person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable dynamic human avatar generation with both high quality and realistic deformations.

Abstract: Creating human avatars is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Recent
advancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented
photorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.
However, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering
models trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their
ability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,
generative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion
models can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through
simple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these
methods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific
rendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth
wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths
of person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable
dynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic
pose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we
optimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a
dynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In
the second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network
weights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,
controllable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,
cross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods.

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: Fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (Prithvi WxC) creates superior gravity wave parameterizations for climate models compared to traditional ML approaches, showing better predictive performance throughout the atmosphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgrid-scale closures for unresolved atmospheric-oceanic processes like gravity waves are a major source of uncertainty in global climate models, and machine learning parameterizations offer a promising alternative to traditional approaches.

Method: Fine-tuned a pre-trained 2.3 billion parameter encoder-decoder foundation model (NASA/IBM's Prithvi WxC) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity waves, learning fluxes from high-resolution reanalysis data.

Result: The foundation model parameterization showed superior predictive performance compared to an Attention U-Net baseline, with Hellinger distance improving from 0.11 to 0.06, performing well even in regions excluded from pre-training.

Conclusion: Foundation models offer versatile and reusable capabilities for developing observations-driven, physically accurate parameterizations for various earth-system processes, representing a significant advancement in climate modeling.

Abstract: Global climate models parameterize a range of atmospheric-oceanic processes
like gravity waves, clouds, moist convection, and turbulence that cannot be
sufficiently resolved. These subgrid-scale closures for unresolved processes
are a leading source of model uncertainty. Here, we present a new approach to
developing machine learning parameterizations of small-scale climate processes
by fine-tuning a pre-trained AI foundation model (FM). FMs are largely
unexplored in climate research. A pre-trained encoder-decoder from a 2.3
billion parameter FM (NASA and IBM Research's Prithvi WxC) -- which contains a
latent probabilistic representation of atmospheric evolution -- is fine-tuned
(or reused) to create a deep learning parameterization for atmospheric gravity
waves (GWs). The parameterization captures GW effects for a coarse-resolution
climate model by learning the fluxes from an atmospheric reanalysis with 10
times finer resolution. A comparison of monthly averages and instantaneous
evolution with a machine learning model baseline (an Attention U-Net) reveals
superior predictive performance of the FM parameterization throughout the
atmosphere, even in regions excluded from pre-training. This performance boost
is quantified using the Hellinger distance, which is 0.11 for the baseline and
0.06 for the fine-tuned model. Our findings emphasize the versatility and
reusability of FMs, which could be used to accomplish a range of atmosphere-
and climate-related applications, leading the way for the creation of
observations-driven and physically accurate parameterizations for more
earth-system processes.

Result: Experiments on Duffing oscillator and four-tank systems show URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based MPC methods.

Conclusion: The integration of ESNs and MPPI enables fast learning and effective control of nonlinear systems, with uncertainty-aware extension providing significant performance improvements over conventional approaches.

Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found
extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems.
However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain
central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) --
reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and
model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of
model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir
predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics
with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI
control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is
further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN
uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs
dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model
confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and
four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing
control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based
model predictive control methods.

### [287] [Sample Efficient Certification of Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03899)
*Sampath Kumar Mulagaleti,Andrea Del Prete*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: A method for efficiently verifying Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) using Lipschitz arguments to certify safety of dynamical systems without solving complex robust optimization problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Control Invariant sets are crucial for system safety certification, but computing CBFs involves intractable robust optimization problems. Scenario-based methods simplify computation but require verification of robust constraints.

Method: Proposes a verification approach using Lipschitz arguments to check if CBFs satisfy robust constraints, forming the basis of a sample-efficient certification algorithm.

Result: Numerical validation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed verification procedure for CBF certification.

Conclusion: The Lipschitz-based verification method provides an efficient way to certify Control Barrier Functions and ensure system safety without solving complex optimization problems.

Abstract: Control Invariant (CI) sets are instrumental in certifying the safety of
dynamical systems. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are effective tools to
compute such sets, since the zero sublevel sets of CBFs are CI sets. However,
computing CBFs generally involves addressing a complex robust optimization
problem, which can be intractable. Scenario-based methods have been proposed to
simplify this computation. Then, one needs to verify if the CBF actually
satisfies the robust constraints. We present an approach to perform this
verification that relies on Lipschitz arguments, and forms the basis of a
certification algorithm designed for sample efficiency. Through a numerical
example, we validated the efficiency of the proposed procedure.

TL;DR: FM-UKF combines transformer-based dynamics modeling with analytical sensor models via UKF for zero-shot state estimation across varying systems without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional state estimation requires extensive manual system identification. Foundation models could enable zero-shot performance but current approaches are limited to sensor models seen during training.

Method: Combines transformer-based system dynamics model with analytically known sensor models using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) framework.

Result: Demonstrates competitive accuracy, effort, and robustness trade-off on container ship benchmark compared to classical methods and end-to-end approaches.

Conclusion: FM-UKF enables generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new sensor configurations, providing a foundation for zero-shot state estimation.

Abstract: State estimation in control and systems engineering traditionally requires
extensive manual system identification or data-collection effort. However,
transformer-based foundation models in other domains have reduced data
requirements by leveraging pre-trained generalist models. Ultimately,
developing zero-shot foundation models of system dynamics could drastically
reduce manual deployment effort. While recent work shows that transformer-based
end-to-end approaches can achieve zero-shot performance on unseen systems, they
are limited to sensor models seen during training. We introduce the foundation
model unscented Kalman filter (FM-UKF), which combines a transformer-based
model of system dynamics with analytically known sensor models via an UKF,
enabling generalization across varying dynamics without retraining for new
sensor configurations. We evaluate FM-UKF on a new benchmark of container ship
models with complex dynamics, demonstrating a competitive accuracy, effort, and
robustness trade-off compared to classical methods with approximate system
knowledge and to an end-to-end approach. The benchmark and dataset are open
sourced to further support future research in zero-shot state estimation via
foundation models.

*Rudi Coppola,Hovsep Touloujian,Pierfrancesco Ombrini,Manuel Mazo Jr*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Data-driven hybrid control strategy combining reinforcement learning and formal methods for lithium-ion battery charging optimization, balancing speed and ageing trade-off with probabilistic performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental trade-off between charging speed and battery ageing/capacity loss in lithium-ion batteries, improving Battery Management Systems (BMS) design.

Method: Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis combining Reinforcement Learning for controller synthesis and data-driven formal methods for abstraction and switched structure partitioning based on initial battery measurements.

Result: Developed a hybrid system with discrete selection among RL-based controllers that works with continuous battery dynamics, providing probabilistic guarantees on closed-loop cell performance.

Conclusion: The approach successfully synthesizes data-driven charging and safety protocols that meet desired criteria while addressing the speed-ageing trade-off in Li-ion batteries with formal performance guarantees.

Abstract: Rechargeable lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are a ubiquitous element of
modern technology. In the last decades, the production and design of such
batteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by
Battery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental
challenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and
the ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We
rely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to
data-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a
Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement
Learning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain
a hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,
and a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched
structure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The
resulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the
continuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the
desired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the
closed-loop performance of the cell.

*Babak Esmaeili,Hamidreza Modares*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: Data-driven motion planning for multi-agent systems using convex optimization to learn safe controllers from experimental data without explicit models, ensuring collision avoidance and dynamic feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable homogeneous linear multi-agent systems to operate safely in obstacle-filled environments without requiring explicit system models, using only experimental data and convex optimization.

Method: Each agent independently learns closed-loop behavior by solving convex SDPs to generate locally invariant ellipsoids and state-feedback gains. A sampling-based planner constructs waypoint trees with transitions allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, coordinated through space-time reservation tables for inter-agent safety.

Result: The framework produces dynamically feasible trajectories that are provably safe with respect to environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions, with local controllers enabling execution without runtime optimization.

Conclusion: The approach effectively synthesizes synchronized, safe trajectories for multiple agents using only data and convex optimization, demonstrating practical applicability for model-free multi-agent motion planning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.
